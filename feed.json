      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",
      "Danmei is \u201ca utopian existence,\u201d said Chen Xingyu, a 32-year-old freelance teacher living in the southwestern city of Kunming. \u201cI would be less happy without it.\u201d",
      "Some of the most popular stories, such as Heaven Official\u2019s Blessing and Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation, have been translated into English, building a global fan base and cracking The New York Times paperback bestseller list.",
      "The stories' language \"is very flowery and poetic, which I really enjoy,\u201d said Kayla McHenry, who works in a law firm in Pennsylvania and reads stories in translation.",

      "It is hard to know how many writers have been caught up in China\u2019s crackdown.",
      "Danmei writers, mostly young females, claimed in social media posts that were later censored that they were detained and questioned by police in the northwestern city of Lanzhou, and expressed humiliation and fear that a criminal record could ruin their future.",

      "The website recently returned with drastically fewer stories and writers. Readers noticed that stories saved in their accounts were taken down. It was unclear if the authors or the website had done it.",
      "Another popular Danmei site, Sosad.fun, based outside China with at least 400,000 registered readers, shut down in April.",
      "Neither website responded to emails seeking comment.",
      "Despite the crackdowns, Danmei stories are still available in China, but fans say they\u2019re tamer and lack erotic appeal. And with most of the best writers gone, they say that what remains just isn\u2019t that good.",
      "Some fans said they have given up reading Danmei stories, but others chase the racy details that brought them to the genre.",
      "\u201cStories I read in high school were much more explicit than those I read nowadays,\u201d said Chen in Kunming. \u201cI have to spend more time and try harder to find them. I need this content to fill my life.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to reject Harvey Weinstein \u2019s claims that his June sexual assault conviction was marred by threats and bullying among jurors.",
      "The disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers submitted sworn affidavits last month from two jurors who said they regretted voting to convict Weinstein and only did so because others on the panel bullied them during five contentious days of deliberations.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said the jurors\u2019 claims were \u201cinconsistent and implausible\u201d and that they provided no legal basis for Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to challenge his conviction.",
      "One juror who claimed in an affidavit that he observed \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d had told the judge during deliberations that he only saw \u201cplayground stuff,\" prosecutors said. Immediately after the trial ended, the same juror told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s not like a fight was going to break out. No, obviously not.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber said he'll rule on Dec. 22.",
      "Prosecutors said they declined to interview any jurors before responding to the defense\u2019s claims because doing so would \u201ccause the very harms\u201d the centuries-old rule was meant to avoid.",

      "The two jurors said in their affidavits that they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by others on the panel who wanted to convict Weinstein on the criminal sex act charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One of the jurors said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \u201cI would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "The hero, Saga Kokushu, played by Junichi Okada, is one of dozens of samurai in a live-or-die survival game to save family, community and honor. Participants receive wooden tags to wear and add another for each rival they kill. The last man standing collects 100 billion yen ($650 million).",
      "Directed by Michihito Fujii, whose credits include \u201cThe Journalist,\u201d about a fearless reporter, and \u201cA Family,\u201d depicting yakuza gangsters, the series pays homage to modern-day video games as well as the legacy of Japanese filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and the original \u201cThe Last Samurai.\u201d",
      "That 2003 film, directed by Edward Zwick, starred Tom Cruise as the samurai hero. It was a big hit, including in Japan, and it helped Japan\u2019s own stars like Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada in their Hollywood careers.",
      "\u201cThe purpose we had in mind was to update the jidaigeki,\u201d said Okada, using the Japanese term for the samurai drama genre.",
      "Okada, who also served as choreographer and producer in \u201cLast Samurai Standing,\u201d said everybody in Japanese film knew so much about the greats who had preceded them, like Kurosawa. The genre even came with a grandiose \u201ctextbook\u201d about the proper portrayal of Japanese culture.",
      "\u201cWe took the want-to approach, keeping in mind that, while thoroughly studying jidaigeki, we were going to do what we want to make, and make something that looked absolutely cool,\u201d Okada told The Associated Press.",
      "Okada is a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. He has starred in various films including \u201cThe Eternal Zero,\u201d about World War II Zero pilots, directed by Takashi Yamazaki, of \u201cGodzilla Minus One.\u201d",
      "Okada previously worked with director Fujii in \u201cHard Days,\u201d a 2023 film about a police officer who tries to cover up a hit-and-run. Okada handpicked Fujii for \u201cLast Samurai Standing.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially an allegory of how Buddhism came to China,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "His libretto, in both English and Mandarin, is based on early chapters of the epic, portraying Monkey King\u2019s birth and daring exploits, as well as the arrogance and pride that lead him to be imprisoned for 500 years until he learns humility, compassion and discipline. At the end of the opera he is finally worthy of accompanying the monk on his journey.",
      "For Hwang, part of the Monkey King\u2019s appeal is the way he undercuts stereotypes.",
      "\u201cEveryone associates the Chinese persona with respect and deference and conformity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Monkey represents this whole other side that doesn\u2019t normally get expressed in terms of being individualistic, being rebellious, being egotistical.",
      "\u201cAlso given the fact that Monkey is rebelling against a corrupt administration, people can look at that however they want to see it.\u201d",
      "Mounting the opera is an ambitious undertaking for the company, which has a long track record of producing new work but faced unique challenges in bringing Monkey\u2019s fantastical adventures to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s flying on clouds, diving underwater, soaring to the heavens,\u201d director Diane Paulus said. \u201cI thought, oh, my gosh, how are we going to do this on the stage? How do we realize this and in what style?\u201d",
      "One answer was to collaborate with puppeteer Basil Twist, who designed the sets as well as puppets, making extensive use of his trademark silks.",
      "\u201cThe whole notion of the ephemeral and letting go of things and the power of transformation to me is beautifully expressed by silk that can become water that then disappears and becomes clouds, and then becomes a giant column,\u201d she said.",
      "Since Monkey King has to perform supernatural feats, engage in acrobatic fighting, shift his shape at will, and also \u2014 this is an opera, after all \u2014 perform arias accompanied by full orchestra, the creators represent him by three different figures: a singer, a puppet and a dancer.",
      "\u201cI call it the Holy Trinity of Monkey King,\u201d said Kang Wang, the Chinese-Australian tenor who sings the title role.",
      "While that spares Wang from having to perform backflips or other complicated dance moves, it doesn\u2019t mean he can stand up straight the whole time. Whenever he\u2019s not singing full out, he has to crouch in a semi-squat the way a character would who is half-monkey, half-man.",

But we also have Kung Fu fighting, operatic dance, and puppetry, and mixed media to convey this magical world.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",

      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",

      "LONDON -- Canadian-Hungarian-British writer David Szalay won the Booker Prize for fiction on Monday for \u201cFlesh,\u201d the story of one man's life from working-class origins in Hungary to mega-wealth in Britain, in which what isn\u2019t on the page is just as important as what is.",
      "Szalay, 51, beat five other finalists, including favorites Andrew Miller of Britain and Indian author Kiran Desai, to take the coveted literary award, which brings a 50,000-pound ($66,000) payday and a big boost to the winner\u2019s sales and profile.",
      "He was chosen from 153 submitted novels by a judging panel that included Irish writer Roddy Doyle and \u201cSex and the City\u201d star Sarah Jessica Parker.",
      "Doyle said \u201cFlesh\u201d \u2014 a book \u201cabout living, and the strangeness of living\u201d \u2014 emerged as the judges\u2019 unanimous choice after a five-hour meeting.",
      "Szalay\u2019s book recounts in spare, unadorned style the life of taciturn Istv\u00e1n, from a teenage relationship with an older woman through time as a struggling immigrant in Britain to unlikely denizen of London high society.",
      "Szalay said he wrote \u201cFlesh\u201d under pressure, after abandoning a novel he'd been working on for four years.",
      "He said the story grew from \u201csimple, fundamental ingredients.\u201d He knew he \"wanted a book that was partly Hungarian and partly English\u201d and was about \u201clife as a physical experience.\u201d",
      "Accepting his trophy at London's Old Billingsgate \u2014 a former fish market turned glitzy events venue \u2014 Szalay thanked the judges for rewarding his \u201crisky\u201d novel.",
      "He recalled asking his editor \u201cwhether she could imagine a novel called \u2018Flesh\u2019 winning the Booker Prize.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have your answer,\" he said.",
      "Doyle, who chaired the judges, said Istv\u00e1n belongs to a group overlooked in fiction: a working-class man. He said that since reading it, he looks more closely when he walks past bouncers standing in the doorways of Dublin pubs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m kind of giving him a second look, because I feel I might know him a bit better,\u201d said Doyle, whose funny, poignant stories of working-class Dublin life won him the 1993 Booker Prize for \u201cPaddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe is quite an opaque character,\" Szalay acknowledged at a news conference. \"He doesn\u2019t explain himself to the reader. He isn\u2019t very articulate. So I really didn\u2019t know quite how people would respond to him as a character.\u201d",

Winners have included Salman Rushdie, Ian McEwan, Arundhati Roy, Margaret Atwood and Samantha Harvey, who took the 2024 prize for space station story \u201cOrbital.\"",

      "The prizes honor both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement. The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.",
      "The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which includes a dream sequence about the Prophet Muhammad that prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding. He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant \u2014 who wasn't born when \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published \u2014 was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "In accepting his award, Rushdie said it can be difficult to write about peace while living in a time of \u201cinexcusable violence,\u201d including the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.",
      "\u201cA book cannot stop a bullet. A poem cannot intercept a bomb,\" he said.",

      "Authorities said Rushdie's attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for his death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target the writer at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, \u201cKnife,\u201d in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d which includes three novellas and two short stories.",

      "Vice President JD Vance has praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for questioning established science and embracing nontraditional voices in health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, \u201call the experts were wrong.\u201d",
      "In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d summit in the nation's capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, saying it has been \u201ca critical part of our success in Washington.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",
      "Critics, including some of the country's leading medical associations, say that Kennedy\u2019s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary.",
      "\u201cThis closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of \u2018wellbeing influencers\u2019 and \u2018MAHA moms\u2019 whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,\u201d said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office.",
      "Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science.",
      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "U.S. tuberculosis cases continued to rise last year \u2014 reaching the highest level in more than a dozen years, according to preliminary data released earlier this year. The vast majority of U.S. TB cases are diagnosed in people born in other countries.",
      "Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, and is spread through the air when an infectious person coughs or sneezes. Roughly a quarter of the global population is estimated to have TB, but only a fraction develop symptoms. It can be fatal if not treated, and is one of the top causes of death worldwide.",

      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.

      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

An interruption in nutrition assistance programs contributed to long lines at food banks and added emotional distress going into the holiday season.",
      "The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "\u201cNever have American families faced a situation where their health care costs are set to double \u2014 double in the blink of an eye,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "While Democrats called for negotiations on the matter, Republicans said a funding bill would need to be passed first.",
      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",

      "At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a \u201cmoderate\u201d share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.",
      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.",
      "\"This dysfunction is damaging enough to our constituents and economy here at home, but it also sends a dangerous message to the watching world,\" said Sen.

      "The development of the vaccine has been praised as a significant milestone for vaccine access in the country and across the rest of the continent.",
      "Motsoaledi said that while South Africa experienced relatively low levels of cholera, many countries in Africa often hit hard by outbreaks would greatly benefit. He said the COVID-19 pandemic exposed how vulnerable African countries were to pandemics as they relied on imported vaccines.",
      "South Africa often experiences cholera outbreaks due to cross-border movements. Other causes includes a lack of clean water in communities such as Hammanskraal, in the capital Pretoria, where provision of clean water remains a major problem.",

      "\u201cWhen we can research, develop and manufacture vaccines locally, we reduce our vulnerability to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical pressures, international market competition and vaccine nationalism, which was apparent at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,\u201d said Motsoaledi.",
      "The trials are being held in the provinces of Gauteng, Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, where cholera cases have previously been reported.",
      "\u201cThis development addresses a critical, life-saving need, given the ongoing global shortages of the vaccine amid recurring cholera outbreaks,\u201d said Biovac CEO Morena Makhoana.",
      "Lerato Maleka, 44, who is one of the first participants in the clinical trial, said she enrolled because of the water issues in South Africa.",

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",
      "In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said.",

      "A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year.",
      "International health officials have recommended the U.S. \u201cenhance case investigation protocols,\u201d because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization.",

      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients.

      "On the night of the eruption, L\u00f3pez and her husband heard strange noises and left the house to see if something was wrong. She had heard on the news that the volcano was erupting, but left Sergio, 5 years old at the time, sleeping at home because she thought they were far enough away.",
      "But soon the lava melted the volcano\u2019s snow-capped peak and merged with the riverbeds, generating an avalanche that rushed down the mountains. The river overcame L\u00f3pez and her husband, overturning their car and causing them to take refuge in a tree and then house.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- U.S. President Donald Trump's decision that the United States government boycott the Group of 20 summit next weekend in South Africa is \u201ctheir loss,\u201d South Africa's leader said Wednesday.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa added that \u201cthe United States needs to think again whether boycott politics actually works, because in my experience it doesn't work.\u201d",
      "Trump announced last week on social media that no U.S. government official would attend the Nov. 22-23 meeting of leaders from 19 of the world's richest and leading developing economies in Johannesburg, citing his widely rejected claims that members of a white minority group in South Africa are being violently persecuted and having their land taken from them because of their race.",
      "The U.S. president has for months targeted South Africa\u2019s Black-led government for criticism over that and a range of other issues, including its decision to accuse U.S. ally Israel of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza in an ongoing and highly contentious case at the United Nations\u2019 top court.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate that the United States decided not to attend the G20,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters outside the South African Parliament. \u201cThe United States by not being at the G20, one must never think that we are not going to go on with the G20. The G20 will go on, all other heads of state will be here. In the end we will take fundamental decisions and their absence is their loss.\u201d",
      "Ramaphosa added that the U.S. is \u201cgiving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world.\u201d",
      "Trump previously confronted Ramaphosa with his baseless claims that the Afrikaner white minority in South Africa were being killed in widespread attacks when the leaders met at the White House in May. At that meeting, Ramaphosa lobbied for Trump to attend this month's G20 summit, the first to be held in Africa.",
      "The G20 was formed in 1999 to bring rich and developing countries together to address issues affecting the global economy and international development. The U.S., China, Russia, India, Japan, France, Germany, the U.K. and the European Union are all members. The U.S. is due to take over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa at the end of the year.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social last week that it was \u201ca total disgrace that the G20 will be held in South Africa\u201d and claimed Afrikaners \"are being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.\u201d",
      "Trump had already said he would not attend the summit, but Vice President JD Vance was expected to represent the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s claims about anti-white violence and persecution in South Africa have reflected those made previously by conservative media commentators in the U.S. as far back as 2018.",

      "Among dozens of lots on the block was a green beryl weighing over 132 carats, which Napoleon was said to have worn at his 1804 coronation. The jewel sold for a hammer price of 838,000 francs, or more than 17 times the high-end pre-sale estimate.",

      "Quantavia Smith, who was often homeless for a decade, now has a studio apartment in Los Angeles with easy access to public transit",
      "BOSTON -- After years of living on the street and crashing on friends' couches, Quantavia Smith was given the keys to a studio apartment in Los Angeles that came with an important perk \u2014 easy access to public transit.",
      "The 38-year-old feels like she went from a life where \u201cno one cares\u201d to one where she has a safe place to begin rebuilding her life. And the metro station the apartment complex was literally built upon is a lifeline as she searches for work without a car.",
      "\u201cIt is more a sense of relief, a sense of independence,\" said Smith, who moved in July. She receives some government assistance and pays 30% of her income for rent \u2014 just $19 a month for an efficiency with a full-market value of $2,000.",
      "\u201cHaving your own space, you feel like you can do anything.\"",

      "\u201cTransit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we\u2019re looking at for housing development,\u201d said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute\u2019s Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.",
      "\u201cIt takes advantage of all of this money we\u2019ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don\u2019t build anything around the areas near them, then it\u2019s kind of like money thrown down the drain,\u201d Freemark said.",
      "The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 \u2014 offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.",
      "In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.",
      "\u201cBig cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\u201d Freemark said. \u201cBuilding new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\u201d",
      "Among projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.",
      "\u201cThe big difference is commuting. You don\u2019t need a car,\u201d said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.",

      "Two Federal Reserve officials expressed opposition Wednesday to another interest rate cut at the central bank\u2019s next meeting in December, further muddying the outlook for the Fed\u2019s next steps",
      "WASHINGTON -- Two Federal Reserve officials expressed opposition Wednesday to another interest rate cut at the central bank's next meeting in December, further muddying the outlook for the Fed's next steps.",
      "The remarks by Susan Collins, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Raphael Bostic, president of the Atlanta Fed, suggest that the central bank's rate-setting committee could be tilting against what had been an expected third straight cut next month.",
      "The officials cited several reasons for keeping rates unchanged, after a reduction in September and in October. They argued that inflation is stubbornly elevated and has been above the Fed's 2% target for nearly five years, while the economy is resilient and doesn't appear to need more rate cuts. The job market is stumbling, with hiring nearly at a standstill, but layoffs still seem muted, they said.",
      "Another factor has been the government shutdown, which has cut off the economic data the Fed relies on to discern the economy\u2019s path. On Wednesday White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said that the jobs and inflation reports for October would likely never be released.",
      "\u201cFormulating an economic outlook is challenging \u2014 and the limited data compounds the difficulty,\u201d Collins said in a speech in Boston.",
      "\u201cIt will likely be appropriate to keep policy rates at the current level for some time ... in this highly uncertain environment,\u201d she added.",
      "That is a shift from her previous speech in October, when she expressed support for at least one more rate cut.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, Bostic said he remains concerned inflation is too high, and added that, \"I ... favor keeping the funds rate steady until we see clear evidence that inflation is again moving meaningfully toward its 2% target.\u201d Bostic said earlier Wednesday that he will retire when his current term ends on Feb. 28, 2026.",
      "Their remarks come at an unusually challenging time for the Fed, with the economy facing both weak hiring and elevated inflation. Typically, the Fed would reduce its rate to encourage borrowing, spending and job gains, while it would keep it unchanged \u2014 or even raise it \u2014 to combat inflation.",
      "The 19 officials on the Fed's rate-setting committee narrowly supported three rate cuts this year at their September meeting, but Chair Jerome Powell said at a news conference late last month that the committee remains divided and another cut in December was not a \u201cforegone conclusion.\u201d",

      "The parasite that causes the disease is developing resistance to existing drugs, meaning \u201cthe ice is thinning,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt hasn't given way, but we're concerned.\u201d",
      "GanLum has been given as a packet of tiny powder-like granules, once daily for three days. But getting people to take malaria drugs over several days has been challenging \u2014 some stop after one or two doses makes them feel better. Experts say a third or more of malaria patients fail to complete the current standard three-day treatment course, a problem that can encourage drug resistance and allow curable cases to intensify.",
      "In an effort to offer a one-time treatment, another team of researchers said an experiment in West Africa found a single dose of four widely available malaria drugs proved to be an effective cure.",
      "The two studies were presented Wednesday at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene conference in Toronto.",
      "Malaria is caused by a parasite that spreads through mosquito bites. Infected people can suffer fever, chills and flu-like illness that, if left untreated, can lead to severe complications and death. It's mainly found in tropical and subtropical climates. The largest death toll in recent years has been seen in children in sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "The medical battle against malaria has ebbed and flowed, as new drugs come along, but the parasite gradually develops the ability to resist them.",
      "At the beginning of this century, for example, resistance to the drug chloroquine was widespread and malaria killed more than 1.8 million people per year. But then came a class of drugs known as artemisinins, which worked well and helped drive a dramatic decline in global malaria death rates.",
      "Artemisinin-based compounds remain the first-line treatment in most cases. But signs of partial resistance have been reported, and \u2014 for several reasons \u2014 malaria death rates have plateaued or even started to rise in some parts of the world.",
      "Dr. Ghyslain Mombo-Ngoma led a study in Gabon in which researchers gave a single-dose treatment combining an artemisinin with three other antimalarial medications \u2014 pyronaridine, sulfadoxine, and pyrimethamine.",
      "From May 2024 to October 2025, he and his colleagues treated more than 1,000 patients, half of them younger than 10, who were sick with malaria but not suffering life-threatening symptoms. A little over half got the four-drug, one-time treatment. The rest got a standard, artemisinin-based treatment.",

It was also highly effective against mutant malaria parasites with partial drug resistance, Novartis officials said.",
      "Side effects included fever and anemia \u2014 similar to what's seen in patients who take some of the current antimalarials, Novartis officials said. There was a higher level of vomiting right after the drug was given, which company officials say may stem from its taste. The company is exploring flavoring or sweetening, a spokesman said.",
      "Novartis officials said they are working toward regulatory approvals. George Jagoe of the Medicines for Malaria Venture, which collaborated with Novartis, said he hopes to see GanLum begin rolling out to patients within 18 months.",

      "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus",
      "California plans to revoke 17,000 commercial driver\u2019s licenses given to immigrants after the Trump administration raised concerns about people in the country illegally receiving licenses to drive a semitruck or a bus. But Gov. Gavin Newsom said that isn't the reason.",
      "Newsom said the revocations are for violations of state law, but he didn\u2019t provide specifics.",
      "The Democratic governor's office said the unspecified violations were of state laws that were in place before the Republican Trump Administration recently tightened rules following a nationwide commercial driver\u2019s license audit launched after a driver in the country illegally made a U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people.",
      "Fatal truck crashes in Texas and Alabama earlier this year also highlight questions about these licenses. A fiery California crash involving an illegal immigrant truck driver last month that killed three more people only added to the concerns.",
      "California state transportation officials didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions seeking more details about why these licenses are being revoked.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday that California\u2019s action to revoke these licenses is an admission that the state had acted improperly even though the state had previously defended its licensing standards.",
      "Duffy previously imposed new restrictions on which immigrants can qualify for one of these commercial driver's licenses. He said earlier this fall that California and five other states had improperly issued commercial driver's licenses to noncitizens, but California is the only state Duffy took action against. He revoked $40 million in federal funding because he said California isn't enforcing English language requirements for truckers, and he has promised to take away another $160 million from the state over these improperly issued licenses.",
      "\u2033After weeks of claiming they did nothing wrong, Gavin Newsom and California have been caught red-handed. Now that we\u2019ve exposed their lies, 17,000 illegally issued trucking licenses are being revoked,\u201d Duffy said. \u201dThis is just the tip of iceberg. My team will continue to force California to prove they have removed every illegal immigrant from behind the wheel of semitrucks and school buses.\u201d",
      "Newsom's office said that every one of the drivers whose licenses are being revoked had valid work authorizations from the federal government.",
      "\u201cOnce again, the Sean \u2018Road Rules\u2019 Duffy fails to share the truth \u2014 spreading easily disproven falsehoods in a sad and desperate attempt to please his dear leader,\" Newsom's spokesman Brandon Richards said.",
      "The new rules for commercial driver's licenses that Duffy announced in September make getting commercial driver\u2019s licenses extremely hard for immigrants because only three specific classes of visa holders will be eligible. States will also have to verify an applicant\u2019s immigration status in a federal database. These licenses will be valid for up to one year unless the applicant\u2019s visa expires sooner than that.",

H-2a is for temporary agricultural workers while H-2B is for temporary nonagricultural workers, and E-2 is for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business. But the rules won\u2019t be enforced retroactively, so those 190,000 drivers will be allowed to keep their commercial licenses at least until they come up for renewal.",
      "Newsom's office said those new requirements were not in place at the time these 17,000 licenses were issued. But these drivers were given notices that their licenses will expire in 60 days.",
      "Duffy said in September that investigators found that one quarter of the 145 licenses they reviewed in California shouldn't have been issued. He cited four California licenses that remained valid after the driver\u2019s work permit expired \u2014 sometimes years after.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- As United Nations climate talks rolled on Wednesday at the elaborate new venues built for the summit, many of the activists eager to shape the talks took to the water.",
      "Carried by scores of boats large and small, a vast group whooped and laughed, smiled and wept. Some splashed canoe paddles through the bay where a northern section of the Amazon rainforest meets the Atlantic Ocean. Others hugged old friends. They pressed their foreheads together or held hands or stood solemnly in moments of prayer and reflection.",
      "They were there to celebrate a community from around the world at a gathering of activists, organizers, environmentalists and Indigenous groups, outside the halls where world leaders are discussing climate change for the next two weeks.

Remember where we are from and where we\u2019re going and what we want.\"",
      "The people who are attending the Conference of the Parties, or COP30, have a wide range of hopes for the outcome. This year is different than in past years, because leaders aren't expected to sign one big agreement at the end of it; instead, organizers and analysts have said it's about getting specifics to execute on past promises to act on climate change.",
      "But many of the activists have some goals in common. They want nations to center the needs of historically marginalized communities who bear the brunt of the climate crisis with the least resources to adapt. That means including those communities in leadership and decision-making. And they want to see political will toward stopping the greenhouse gas emissions, resource extraction and other practices driving the problem.",

      "The ability to express thoughts and feelings freely is a welcome respite for many arriving in Brazil after several years of these talks being held in countries where governments imposed limitations on free speech and demonstrations.",
      "On Tuesday night, that freedom ran up against security personnel as a group of activists briefly tried to force their way into the main COP venue before they were pushed back.",
      "The evolution that needs to happen for the world to take action is \"not in the halls of the U.N. COP, but it\u2019s in the streets and it is with our people,\u201d said Jacob Johns, an Akimel O'Otham and Hopi member of A Wisdom Keepers Delegation who witnessed the security breach.",

      "Saturday is when MSNBC officially becomes MS NOW, standing for My Source for News, Opinion and the World. That's the most visible manifestation of parent company Comcast's decision to spin off most of its cable networks into a new company known as Versant.",
      "It's tough enough when one partner tells another that they're leaving for someone new. In this case, they're just leaving the partner behind; a cable television network is considered such a diminishing asset in today's media world that giant companies would rather be free of them.",
      "\u201cA lot of us really didn't know what it meant,\u201d said prime-time host Jen Psaki, \u201cand it didn't feel great initially.\u201d",
      "Left on its own, MS NOW is embracing the ethos of a startup, suggesting it will be better positioned to experiment without ties to the more corporate NBC News. \u201cMorning Joe\u201d is starting its own newsletter. Podcast ideas are encouraged. The network is expanding live events, letting its television stars interact with the audience; Rachel Maddow has one in Chicago later this month.",

MSNBC was also buoyed by a strong election night performance where it ran neck-and-neck with Fox, even while missing the khaki-clad numbers nerd, Steve Kornacki, who chose to remain with NBC News.",

      "Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, is retiring at the end of his current term in February, opening up a new seat on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee at a time that President Donald Trump is seeking to exert more ...",
      "WASHINGTON -- Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, will retire at the end of his current term in February, opening up a new seat on the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee at a time that President Donald Trump is seeking to exert more control over the central bank.",
      "As president of one of the Fed\u2019s 12 regional banks, Bostic, 59, serves on the 19-member committee that meets eight times a year to decide whether to change a key short-term interest rate that influences borrowing costs throughout the economy. Only 12 of the 19 participants vote on rates at each meeting. The regional Fed presidents rotate as voters, and the Atlanta Fed\u2019s president will next vote in 2027.",
      "Bostic\u2019s replacement will be selected by the Atlanta Fed\u2019s board of directors, which are made up of local business and community leaders, not the Trump administration. The terms of all the regional Fed presidents end in 2026.",
      "Bostic is the first Black and openly gay president of a regional Fed bank in the Fed's 112-year history and was first appointed in June 2017. He has recently expressed concerns that inflation is still too high for the Fed to deeply cut its key rate, and suggested he supported just one rate cut this year, while the Fed has cut twice.",
      "Bostic did not provide a reason for stepping down, but is speaking later Wednesday and could provide more details.",
      "In 2022, Bostic acknowledged that many of his financial investments and trades in previous years had violated Fed ethics rules and revised all his financial statements dating back to 2017. At the time, he said the trades were made by investment managers that he did not directly oversee and that he was unaware of the transactions.",
      "The Fed\u2019s Washington, D.C.-based board of governors will vote on whether to approve Bostic\u2019s replacement. Trump has sought to gain more control over the Fed's board, which would potentially give the administration more sway over the approval of the regional Fed presidents. Three of the current seven members of the board were appointed by Trump.",

      "In a September essay, Bostic said that the Fed's short-term interest rate \u2014 at that time about 4.3% \u2014 was only \u201cmarginally restrictive,\u201d meaning that it was barely holding back the economy and it wouldn't require many cuts to bring it to a level that would stimulate the growth.",
      "At the same time, Bostic said he remained worried about inflation: \u201cI will not be complacent and simply assume ... another inflation outbreak won\u2019t happen,\u201d he wrote.",

Many of the platforms and apps that offer gambling, such as FanDuel and DraftKings, include optional safeguards to limit time or losses. Other apps can block access to the platforms for set amounts of time.",
      "Here's what to know:",

      "The new prevalence of prediction markets, such as PredictIt and Kalshi, has also created new opportunities to place wagers online on everything from election outcomes to celebrity news to the weather.",
      "According to public health advocates, the biggest warning sign of a problem is if you\u2019re devoting time to online betting that\u2019s taking away from other things in your life \u2014 especially your relationships with friends, family, and work. If you're spending money on gambling that could instead go towards unmet basic needs, that's also a warning sign.",

      "Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants over interchange fees",
      "NEW YORK -- Visa and Mastercard have proposed a settlement in their long-running legal dispute with merchants and retailers over how much they charge merchants to accept their cards.",
      "The most important part of the settlement could directly impact how customers use their Visa- and Mastercard-issued credit cards, and may result in some consumers getting denied at the point-of-sale for purchases",
      "Visa and Mastercard have been in litigation with a class-action group of merchants for nearly 20 years over the costs they impose on merchants to use their payment networks, known as interchange. A previous settlement was rejected by the judge overseeing the case last this year, requiring Visa and Mastercard\u2019s lawyers to go back to the drawing board on the scope and size of the settlement.",
      "The new part of the settlement announced Monday addresses the \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule, a cornerstone of how credit and debit cards work in the U.S.",
      "The \u201chonor all cards\u201d rule states that if a merchant accepts Visa or Mastercard as a form of payment, they are required to accept all iterations of Visa and Mastercard products, regardless of who issues it and the cost to the merchant.",
      "That has led to consternation among merchants over the years because rewards-heavy credit cards, like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Citi Strata Elite, use a premium version of a Visa or Mastercard. For the Sapphire Reserve, Chase uses the Visa Infinite card, and for a card like Strata Elite, it\u2019s issued as a World Elite Mastercard. These cards have gotten far more popular in the last decade.",
      "Both a Visa Infinite and World Elite Mastercard cost more for a merchant to accept. The amount of additional interchange a merchant will pay varies on size and industry, but one example is the Visa Infinite, which can be 15 basis points (0.15%) more expensive than a Visa Signature (a mid-tier credit card) for a merchant to accept.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, merchants could discriminate between the different tiers of Visa and Mastercard products, meaning high-reward credit card users may be declined at checkout if the merchant has opted out of accepting the higher-tier card. A merchant may also be able to pass along the higher cost to accept the rewards cards to the customer in the form of a surcharge on their bill, under the proposed settlement.",
      "This will place merchants in the position of making a choice: accept all cards with the higher fees or reject some of the higher-fee cards and likely upset wealthier consumers who typically enjoy earning points on routine purchases.",

In this settlement it would be a 10 basis point reduction in swipe fees for five years, and standard credit card transactions would be processed at 1.25% of the purchase price for eight years.",
      "When the settlement was announced on Monday, the major merchant and retail lobby groups came out in opposition, so it\u2019s not certain whether this settlement will ultimately be the one that is finalized. Merchants and lobbyists have been pushing for years to get Congress to regulate interchange fees, as they do with debit cards. The merchant groups say this settlement does not go far enough.",
      "\u201cOnce again, this proposal is all window dressing and no substance. The reduction in swipe fees doesn\u2019t begin to go far enough, and the change in the honor-all-cards rule would accomplish nothing. If the courts can\u2019t fix this, it\u2019s time for Congress to take action,\u201d said Stephanie Martz, chief administrative officer and general counsel for the National Retail Federation, in a statement.",
      "The payment networks, who are ready to put the matter behind them after two decades of litigation, say this may be the best solution for the merchants to potentially avoid a drawn out trial-and-appeal process.",
      "\u201cWe believe that this is the best resolution for all parties, delivering the clarity, flexibility and consumer protections that were sought in this effort,\u201d a Mastercard company spokesperson said.",

Choosing a used hybrid SUV saves money at the point of purchase, and the hybrid engine helps lower the cost of refueling for many miles down the road.",
      "Using a price cap of $25,000, Edmunds\u2019 team has compiled five used hybrid-powered SUVs that are practical and kind to a car shopping budget.",
      "The Escape Hybrid is the fuel-sipping cousin of Ford\u2019s popular compact SUV. Getting it down the road is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder paired to an electric motor. Front-wheel drive is standard; all-wheel drive is optional. In terms of fuel economy, both the front-wheel-drive and all-wheel drive models delivers an EPA-estimated 39 mpg combined. Edmunds has complimented the Escape\u2019s comfortable ride, easy-to-use controls and everyday practicality.",
      "Look for:Arriving for the 2020 model year, the fourth-generation Escape Hybrid is a well-rounded driving companion. For 2023, Ford updated the infotainment system and exterior design. For added peace of mind, it\u2019s worth knowing the hybrid has always come standard with Ford\u2019s Co-Pilot360 bundle of driver assist features.",
      "The Honda CR-V has long been a top choice for SUV shoppers looking for reliable transportation at an affordable price. During testing, Edmunds complimented the driving refinement of the CR-V with the available hybrid powertrain. Braking and handling are equally polished, though Edmunds noted accelerating from 0 to 60 mph took 8.5 seconds \u2014 1 second longer than the non-hybrid model. Fuel economy is strong at an EPA-estimated 38 mpg combined city/highway for 2020-2022 models. The spacious interior has good outward visibility and generous cargo space.",
      "Look for:The hybrid version of the previous generation CR-V ran from 2020 through 2022. Standard equipment included all-wheel drive, a 7-inch touchscreen, wired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and the Honda Sensing suite of driver assist features. Honda dropped the entry-level LX trim for the 2021 model year, so used prices tick upward from that point.",
      "Making a styling statement isn\u2019t always high on car shoppers\u2019 priority list. Hyundai didn\u2019t get that memo because the Tucson Hybrid\u2019s eye-catching design is highlighted by a sculpted exterior and headlights hidden within the pattern of the grille. Under the hood is a turbocharged 1.6-liter four-cylinder and electric motor coupled to standard all-wheel drive. Fuel economy is up to 38 mpg combined depending on the trim and model year. Better still, Edmunds notes this peppier drivetrain addresses the non-hybrid Tucson\u2019s sluggish acceleration.",
      "Look for:The redesigned Tucson created a splash when it arrived for the 2022 model year. Its upscale interior matched the bold exterior; the cabin was filled with high-quality materials, and standard features included an 8-inch touchscreen with wireless smartphone connectivity. The Tucson also has an outstanding warranty, including 10 years/100,000 miles of powertrain coverage.",

      "The Niro makes a strong case for itself based on its lower price point and excellent economy. Along with the Niro hybrid, there are plug-in and fully electrified versions. Given its small size, the Niro delivers a surprising amount of passenger space and cargo room. The ride is generally smooth, though Edmunds noted it can get unsettled on bumpy roads. A class-leading warranty and up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined, depending on the trim and model year, are two additional standout qualities.",
      "Look for:A redesign for the 2023 model year gave the Niro a futuristic shape and improved cabin quality. Edmunds complimented the interior design but found some audio and climate controls overly finicky. The Niro is also front-wheel-drive, with no option to add all-wheel drive. Yet its budget-friendly prices mean used versions readily come in below $25,000.",
      "The RAV4 Hybrid uses the strong foundation of Toyota\u2019s best-selling SUV and adds greater fuel economy and speedier acceleration. Edmunds found the all-wheel-drive RAV4 Hybrid needed 7.8 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph \u2014 a second faster than the non-hybrid version. Fuel economy is excellent thanks to EPA-estimated combined average of up to 40 mpg depending on trim and model year. The RAV4 also has near class-leading cargo space, plus a low load floor that\u2019s appreciated when loading heavy items.",
      "Look for:The fifth generation of the RAV4 and RAV4 Hybrid was available from 2019 to 2025. Outside of some upgraded tech touches \u2014 such as a larger touchscreen and improved smartphone connectivity \u2014 changes were minimal. The RAV4 holds onto its resale value, so older used models will more easily fall under $25,000.",
      "A well-maintained used hybrid SUV is a savvy way to save money when sealing the deal and in terms of keeping fuel bills reasonable.",

The investigation, which began 15 months ago, was welcomed by Zelenskyy who urged officials to cooperate with the probe. Energoatom says the investigation has not disrupted its operations.",

      "\u201cWhen we look at the history of the energy world in recent decades, there is no other time when energy security tensions have applied to so many fuels and technologies at once,\u201d Birol said. \u201cWith energy security front and (center) for many governments, their responses need to consider the synergies and trade-offs that can arise with other policy goals \u2013 on affordability, access, competitiveness and climate change.\u201d",
      "In a conference call Wednesday, Birol said: \u201cWe will still use oil, we will still use gas. But the growth of electricity demand is spectacular.\u201d",
      "He noted the role transportation plays in accounting for 45% of global oil consumption, for example. \u201cHow the electrification of the transportation takes place, especially in countries beyond China and Europe, will determine the shape of the oil demand and growth.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's edition of the yearly report is the first released since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term. Trump's administration has for a second time opted out of the Paris agreement, rolled back dozens of climate regulations, slashed federal support for renewable energies such as wind and solar power and is reversing the \u201cendangerment finding\u201d that sits at the core of U.S. climate policy.",
      "Trump has pledged his support instead to the fossil fuel industry, investing in coal and loosening restrictions on pollution.",
      "But energy analysts said the shift to clean power is happening regardless of climate policy around the world.",
      "\u201cThe evidence on the ground is overwhelming. EV sales are taking off in many emerging countries, solar is permeating even through the Middle East,\u201d said Dave Jones, chief analyst at global energy think tank Ember. \"Renewables and electrification will dominate the future.\u201d",

      "A little more than a year ago, Ryan Sprankle welcomed President Donald Trump to one of the three grocery stores his family owns near Pittsburgh. Trump was on the campaign trail; they talked about high grocery prices, and the Republican nominee picked up a bag of popcorn.",
      "But these days, Sprankle would have a different message if Trump or any lawmakers visited his store. He wants them to know that delayed SNAP benefits during the government shutdown hurt his customers and his small, independent chain.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t take away from the most needy people in the country. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Sprankle said. \u201cIt's a lack of empathy and it's on all their hands.",
      "The Trump administration froze funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October, impacting food access for some 42 million Americans. On Monday, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that would reopen the federal government and replenish SNAP funds, but the U.S. House of Representatives still must consider the bill. It's unclear when SNAP payments might resume if the government reopens.",
      "In 2024, SNAP recipients redeemed a little more than $96 billion in benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program. The majority \u2013 74% -- was spent at superstores and supermarkets, a category that includes big chains like Walmart and Kroger but also some independent stores like Sprankle's.",
      "Around 14% was spent at smaller grocery and convenience stores, businesses often tucked into neighborhoods and more easily accessible to SNAP beneficiaries.",
      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart declined to comment on the impact of the SNAP funding lapse but noted that it has been lowering prices and donating to local food banks. Kroger also declined to comment.",
      "Shoppers not receiving their food benefits affects all retailers but becomes \u201ca big problem more quickly\u201d at small chains, Sprankle said. His Kittanning, Pennsylvania, store gets 25% of its revenue from SNAP, but customers who don't get government assistance also are worried about the shutdown, according to Sprankle. They're spending less, trading down to cheaper goods or heading to food banks, he said.",
      "Sprankle said lower sales cut into the overtime he can offer to the chain's 140 employees. Many are worried about losing their jobs, he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says his $300 million White House ballroom will be paid for \u201c100% by me and some friends of mine.\u201d",
      "The White House released a list of 37 donors, including crypto billionaires, charitable organizations, sports team owners, powerful financiers, tech and tobacco giants, media companies, longtime supporters of Republican causes and several of the president's neighbors in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "It's incomplete. Among others, the list doesn't include Carrier Group, which offered to donate an HVAC system for the ballroom, and artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia, whose CEO, Jensen Huang, publicly discussed its donation.",
      "The White House hasn't said how much each donor is giving, and almost none was willing to divulge that. Very few commented on their contributions when contacted by The Associated Press.",
      "A senior White House official said the list has grown since it was first released in October, but some companies don't want to be publicly named until required to do so by financial disclosure regulations. No foreign individuals or entities were among the donors, according to the official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details that haven't been made public.",
      "Here's a look at the divulged donors:",

Its cloud-based computing operation, Amazon Web Services, is a major government contractor.",

Before returning to the White House, Trump hosted Cook at his Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said he had spoken with Cook about the company\u2019s long-running tax battles with the European Union. Cook also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In the spring, Trump threatened the computing giant with tariffs after Apple announced plans to build manufacturing facilities in India. In August, Cook presented the president with a customized glass plaque with a gold base as the CEO announced plans to bring Apple's total investment commitment in U.S. manufacturing over four years to $600 billion.",
      "Google Background: During his first term, Trump\u2019s administration sued Google for antitrust violations. While a candidate last year, Trump suggested he might seek to break up the search engine behemoth. Once Trump won the election, Google donated $1 million to his inauguration, and its CEO, Sundar Pichai, joined other major tech executives in attending the ceremony. Google's subsidiary, YouTube, agreed in September to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump after it suspended his account following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. According to court filings, $22 million of that went to the Trust for the National Mall, which can help pay for ballroom construction.",

But at least $120 billion of that involved holdovers first announced during Biden's administration.",
      "Microsoft Background: The company donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, twice what it spent for Biden's or for Trump's first inauguration. CEO Satya Nadella has also met with Trump numerous times, as Microsoft has supported the administration\u2019s relaxation of regulations on artificial intelligence. He met previously with Biden, too.

Trump says he'll work to ensure tech giants can secure their own sources of electricity to power data centers, especially as they expand energy-hogging artificial intelligence operations.

      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",

      "Immediate grounding exercises include the 3-3-3 technique, where you name three things you see, three you hear and three parts of your body that you can move. Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.",

And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,\" said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. \"But it\u2019s not nearly fast enough for what\u2019s needed.\u201d",
      "Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.",
      "Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China's going up 15.5% and India's soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.",
      "Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,\u201d said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cUnfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can\u2019t say it\u2019s failed.

      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",

      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later.",

He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",

He picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",
      "Watson died in hospice care after a brief illness, his son said Friday. His former research lab confirmed he passed away a day earlier.",
      "\u201cHe never stopped fighting for people who were suffering from disease,\u201d Duncan Watson said of his father.",
      "Watson's initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease \u2014 maybe in time to help his son.",
      "He gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab revoked several honorary titles it had given Watson, saying his statements were \u201creprehensible\u201d and \u201cunsupported by science.\u201d",
      "Watson\u2019s combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \u201ca regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \u201cHis outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d",
      "Long before that, Watson scorned political correctness.",
      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",
      "Crick himself wrote that the partnership thrived in part because the two men shared \u201ca certain youthful arrogance, a ruthlessness, and an impatience with sloppy thinking.\u201d",
      "Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. (She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Cold Spring Harbor lab's president, Bruce Stillman.",
      "Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s program for molecular biology, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview.",
      "Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.",
      "He transformed the lab into a \u201cvibrant, incredibly important center,\u201d Ptashne said. It was \u201cone of the miracles of Jim: a more disheveled, less smooth, less typically ingratiating person you could hardly imagine.\u201d",
      "From 1988 to 1992, Watson directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Watson was on hand at the White House in 2000 for the announcement that the federal project had completed an important goal: a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome, basically a road map to an estimated 90 percent of human genes.",
      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",
      "Both of Watson\u2019s Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004.",

The potential severe geomagnetic storms could disrupt radio and GPS communications, according to forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "How bright the auroras are and how far south they are visible will depend on when the solar bursts get here and how they interact with Earth's atmosphere. The vibrant displays could be visible across much of the northern U.S., and as far south as Alabama and Northern California.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major face-lift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Last year, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And soon afterward, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit. Severe storms are capable of scrambling other radio and GPS communications.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and set telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",

      "Barring a last-minute reprieve, Bryan Frederick Jennings, 66, is set to die by lethal injection at 6 p.m. Thursday at Florida State Prison near Starke. Jennings was convicted and sentenced to death twice for the 1979 murder in Brevard County, both of which were reversed on appeal. The final trial in 1986 resulted in a third death sentence.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court denied his final appeal Wednesday.",
      "According to court records, Jennings was a 20-year-old on leave from the Marine Corps on May 11, 1979, when he took down a screen at the bedroom window of 6-year-old Rebecca Kunash while her parents were in another room.",

He then \u201cswung her by her legs to the ground with such force that she fractured her skull,\u201d court records show. The girl was then drowned in the canal, where her body was found later that day.",
      "Jennings was arrested a few hours later on a traffic warrant, where investigators found he matched the description of a man seen near the Kunash home when Rebecca disappeared. Shoe prints found at the home matched those Jennings was wearing, his fingerprints were found on the girl's windowsill, and his clothes and hair were wet.",
      "DeSantis has ordered more executions in a single year than any Florida governor since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The previous record was set in 2014 with eight executions. After Jennings, executions this year are scheduled Nov. 20 for Richard Barry Randolph and Dec. 9 for Mark Allen Geralds, which would bring the year's total so far to 18.",
      "At a recent news conference, DeSantis explained the unprecedented number of executions by saying his goal is to bring justice to victim families who have waited decades for the death sentences to be carried out.",
      "\u201cSome of these crimes were committed in the '80s,\" DeSantis said. \"Justice delayed is justice denied. I felt I owed it to them to make sure this ran very smoothly. If I honestly through someone was innocent, I would not pull the trigger.\u201d",

      "\u201cTransit-oriented development should be one of, if not the biggest solution that we\u2019re looking at for housing development,\u201d said Yonah Freemark, research director at the Urban Institute\u2019s Land Use Lab, who has written extensively on the topic.",
      "\u201cIt takes advantage of all of this money we\u2019ve spent on transportation infrastructure. If you build the projects and don\u2019t build anything around the areas near them, then it\u2019s kind of like money thrown down the drain,\u201d Freemark said.",
      "The Santa Monica and Vermont Apartments where Smith lives is part of an ambitious plan by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build 10,000 housing units near transit sites by 2031 \u2014 offering developers land discounts in exchange for affordable housing development and other community benefits.",
      "In Washington D.C., the transit authority has completed eight projects since 2022 that provided nearly 1,500 apartments and a million square feet of office space. About half were in partnership with Amazon, which committed $3.6 billion in low-cost loans and grants for affordable housing projects in Washington, as well as Nashville, Tennessee, and the Puget Sound area in Washington state. Almost all are within a half-mile of public transit.",
      "\u201cBig cities face the greatest challenges when it comes to traffic congestion and high housing costs,\u201d Freemark said. \u201cBuilding new homes near transit helps address both problems by encouraging people to take transit while increasing housing supply.\u201d",
      "Among projects Boston has built, the Pok Oi Residents in Chinatown is a 10-minute walk to the subway and a half-dozen bus stops. That's a draw for Bernie Hernandez, who moved his family there from a Connecticut suburb after his daughter got into a Boston university.",
      "\u201cThe big difference is commuting. You don\u2019t need a car,\u201d said Hernandez, who said he can walk to the grocery story and pharmacy. His 17-year-old daughter takes the subway to school. Now, his car mostly sits idle, saving him money on gas and time spent in traffic.",
      "\u201cYou get to go to different places very quickly. Everything is convenient,\" Hernandez said.",
      "States from Massachusetts to California are passing laws targeting restrictive zoning regulations that for decades prohibited building multifamily developments and contributed to housing shortages.",
      "Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a state law allowing taller apartment buildings on land owned by transit agencies and near bus, train and subway lines.",
      "\u201cBuilding more homes in our most sustainable locations is the key to tackling the affordability crisis and locking in California\u2019s success for many years to come,\u201d said State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who authored the bill.",

It wasn't clear whether Grubb would take the stand after the officer's written statement was read into the record on Wednesday in Franklin County Common Pleas Court.",
      "Grubb and the fellow officer from the Blendon Township force had approached Young's car on Aug. 24, 2023, about a report she was suspected of stealing alcohol from a grocery store in suburban Columbus. She partially lowered her window and the other officer ordered her out. Instead, she rolled her car forward toward Grubb, who fired a single bullet through her windshield into her chest, video footage showed.",
      "A special prosecutor told the jury during opening statements last week that Grubb lacked justification for shooting Young, arguing she did not pose a threat to him or anyone at the time of the encounter. The defense countered that Young's acceleration of her vehicle in Grubb's direction was grounds for the 31-year-old officer's actions.",
      "In Grubb's written statement, read to the jury by a special agent for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the officer said he observed Young arguing with his fellow officer and positioned himself in front of her vehicle to provide backup and to protect other people in the parking lot.",
      "He said he drew his gun after he heard Young fail to comply with his partner's commands. When she drove toward him, he said in the statement, he felt her car hit his legs and shins and begin to lift his body off the ground.",

      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa added that \u201cthe United States needs to think again whether boycott politics actually works, because in my experience it doesn't work.\u201d",
      "Trump announced last week on social media that no U.S. government official would attend the Nov. 22-23 meeting of leaders from 19 of the world's richest and leading developing economies in Johannesburg, citing his widely rejected claims that members of a white minority group in South Africa are being violently persecuted and having their land taken from them because of their race.",

      "\u201cIt is unfortunate that the United States decided not to attend the G20,\u201d Ramaphosa told reporters outside the South African Parliament. \u201cThe United States by not being at the G20, one must never think that we are not going to go on with the G20. The G20 will go on, all other heads of state will be here. In the end we will take fundamental decisions and their absence is their loss.\u201d",
      "Ramaphosa added that the U.S. is \u201cgiving up the very important role that they should be playing as the biggest economy in the world.\u201d",
      "Trump previously confronted Ramaphosa with his baseless claims that the Afrikaner white minority in South Africa were being killed in widespread attacks when the leaders met at the White House in May. At that meeting, Ramaphosa lobbied for Trump to attend this month's G20 summit, the first to be held in Africa.",
      "The G20 was formed in 1999 to bring rich and developing countries together to address issues affecting the global economy and international development.

      "Across Chicago\u2019s Latino neighborhoods, fear of a federal immigration crackdown has emptied the streets",
      "CHICAGO -- The cyclists arrive at sunrise, rolling through Chicago\u2019s Latino neighborhoods and stopping at tamale carts, elote stands and candy stalls. They buy out every last item \u2014 every tamale, every corn cob, every bundle of sweets. Then they load up the food and deliver it to shelters and families in need.",
      "Since the start of a federal immigration crackdown that has led to more than 3,200 arrests in the Chicago metropolitan area, streets and storefronts in the city\u2019s Latino neighborhoods have emptied out. Street vendors, fearing arrest, have been afraid to leave their homes to work. Local restaurants have struggled as customers stay home.",
      "But as fear spread, so did something else \u2014 neighbors stepping up for one another and finding creative ways to show up for vendors and restaurant owners. This includes a grassroots effort to organize so-called \u201cbuy out\u201d events meant to allow vendors who fear being detained by immigration agents to go home early. Some Chicagoans have pooled money in their neighborhoods or through local organizations while others have simply bought out taco stands while on their way to work or tamale vendors outside their local bars.",
      "In Little Village, Rick Rosales, community organizer with Cycling x Solidarity, helps organize two of these \u201cbuy out\u201d rides per week that typically support five street vendors each.",
      "\u201cThe vendors are often speechless,\u201d Rosales said. \u201cThey\u2019ll say, \u2018I have a lot of tamales. You want all of them?\u2019\u201d",
      "Once, after the group bought out a tamale vendor\u2019s cart, that man found them days later to say immigration agents were spotted on his block just hours after. \u201cYou saved my life,\u201d Rosales said the man told them.",
      "\u201cThis is about food and joy and bike rides,\u201d Rosales said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also so incredibly high stakes because of the fear in our communities right now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s hard to say how many street vendors have been targeted by federal immigration agents, said Maria Orozco, outreach organizer for the Street Vendors Association of Chicago, adding she knows of at least 10 who have been detained.",
      "In September, a tamale vendor was detained while selling outside a Home Depot, according to local advocates. Soon after, federal agents arrested a flower seller in the southwest neighborhood of Archer Heights. Then they came for a cotton candy vendor in the predominantly Mexican American Little Village. Immigration agents descended on the Swap-O-Rama flea market in October and detained more than a dozen people. And last week, over 100 residents in the Brighton Park neighborhood rallied to demand the release of their local tamalero.",
      "U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Orozco said losing these vendors is as much a cultural loss as an economic one, calling them part of the \u201cfabric of our city.\u201d She said they bring life, color and flavor to the city's streets, preserving culinary traditions and building a sense of community \u2014 and they are beloved by neighbors.",
      "Street vendors who are afraid to work or are seeing drops in sales can apply to get financial support through the Street Vendors Association of Chicago. The group launched a GoFundMe with the goal of raising $300,000 to support street vendors.",
      "Orozco said local businesses have also hosted pop-up events where a certain percentage of proceeds go to street vendors. The organization has also helped connect vendors to people hoping to \u201cbuy them out,\u201d Orozco said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been emotional to see,\u201d she said. \u201cThe vendors themselves didn\u2019t realize how much Chicagoans love and support them. None of us expected this.\u201d",
      "As Alonso Zaragoza, executive administrator of his neighborhood advocacy group, drove through his predominantly Latino community of Belmont Cragin, he noticed restaurants were mostly empty and dark. Restaurants in majority-Latino communities have reported significant drops in sales since federal agents descended on the city in September.",
      "So Zaragoza began organizing restaurant crawls, drawing hundreds to struggling Latino-owned eateries. His previous event began at a taco and tamales restaurant and ended with a Mexican ice cream shop. Along the way, street cart vendors hawked elote, cotton candy and balloons as a local musical group played folk and bluegrass music.",

      "Among those Martinez helped recently was a baker from Mexico City who arrived in Chicago 24 years ago.",
      "Each night, he works late, hands dusted with flour, kneading dough until they\u2019re sore and aching. For those few quiet hours, after his four children are asleep, the world feels simpler.",
      "\u201cThere is a magic when I\u2019m baking,\u201d he said in Spanish. \u201cI feel free. When I\u2019m angry, I feel like the bread will absorb it. So I try to be happy and at peace, even when I know the reality is different.\u201d",
      "By 3 a.m., he\u2019s up again for his grocery store shift, juggling work and school drop-offs. For years, he\u2019s sold birthday cakes and pan dulce \u201cby word of mouth\u201d from his small kitchen, dreaming of one day opening his own shop.",
      "But the baker has also heard the stories: street vendors arrested on residential streets and federal agents circling his historically Mexican American neighborhood of Pilsen. Two of his friends have been detained. When he hears sirens and helicopters, he feels \u201csick with fear.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid for my youngest daughter,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be horrible to leave her. \u2026 I can\u2019t see myself without my children.\u201d",
      "Martinez led the baker to a table and pulled off a black cloth. A silver, restaurant-grade mixer gleamed under the fluorescent light. Martinez also handed him an envelope with $1,500 gathered from neighbors hoping to help support him when he feels unsafe selling his baked goods on the street.",
      "The man\u2019s hand flew up to cover his mouth. He kicked his legs and began to cry.",
      "\u201cThank you so much,\u201d he said, clutching a mixer attachment to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has signed a government funding bill that ends a record 43-day shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed a government funding bill Wednesday night, ending a record 43-day shutdown that caused financial stress for federal workers who went without paychecks, stranded scores of travelers at airports and generated long lines at some food banks.",
      "The shutdown magnified partisan divisions in Washington as Trump took unprecedented unilateral actions \u2014 including canceling projects and trying to fire federal workers \u2014 to pressure Democrats into relenting on their demands.",
      "The Republican president blamed the situation on Democrats and suggested voters shouldn\u2019t reward the party during next year\u2019s midterm elections.",
      "\u201cSo I just want to tell the American people, you should not forget this,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhen we come up to midterms and other things, don\u2019t forget what they\u2019ve done to our country.\u201d",
      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. \"They never achieve the objective that you announce. And guess what? You haven\u2019t achieved that objective yet, and you\u2019re not going to.\u201d",
      "The frustration and pressures generated by the shutdown was reflected when lawmakers debated the spending measure on the House floor.",
      "Republicans said Democrats sought to use the pain generated by the shutdown to prevail in a policy dispute.",
      "\u201cThey knew it would cause pain and they did it anyway,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson said.",
      "Democrats said Republicans raced to pass tax breaks earlier this year that they say mostly will benefit the wealthy. But the bill before the House Wednesday \u201cleaves families twisting in the wind with zero guarantee there will ever, ever be a vote to extend tax credits to help everyday people pay for their health care,\u201d said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass.",
      "Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said Democrats would not give up on the subsidy extension even if the vote did not go their way.",
      "\u201cThis fight is not over,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cWe\u2019re just getting started.\u201d",
      "The House had not been in legislative session since Sept. 19, when it passed a short-term measure to keep the government open when the new budget year began in October. Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

The provisions drew criticism from Republicans as well. Johnson said he was \u201cvery angry about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was dropped in at the last minute, and I did not appreciate that, nor did most of the House members,\u201d Johnson said, promising a vote on the matter as early as next week.",

      "\u201cIt's a subsidy on top of a subsidy. Our friends added it during COVID,\u201d Cole said. \u201cCOVID is over. They set a date certain that the subsidies would run out. They chose the date.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the enhanced tax credit was designed to give more people access to health care and no Republican voted for it.",

      "Without the enhanced tax credit, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",
      "It\u2019s unclear whether the parties will find any common ground on health care before the December vote in the Senate. Johnson has said he will not commit to bringing it up in his chamber.",
      "Some Republicans have said they are open to extending the COVID-19 pandemic-era tax credits as premiums will soar for millions of people, but they also want new limits on who can receive the subsidies. Some argue that the tax dollars for the plans should be routed through individuals rather than go directly to insurance companies.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A Virginia Democrat who helped investigate the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol is making a comeback bid after last week\u2019s sweeping election wins as her party looks to break President Donald Trump\u2019s grip on federal power in the 2026 midterms.",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, a military veteran who co-presented the Jan. 6 Select Committee\u2019s findings after Trump\u2019s first term, told The Associated Press she will seek the Democratic nomination in Virginia\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. Her bid sets up a potential rematch with Republican Rep. Jennifer Kiggans, another military veteran who ousted her in 2022.",
      "The Hampton Roads district, racially diverse and with a notable military population, is among the several dozen nationally that will determine House control. Luria\u2019s candidacy, in particular, highlights what\u2019s at stake for Democrats\u2019 overall identity and for Trump in the final years of his second term in the White House.",
      "The country, Luria said in an interview, is \u201cin very tenuous times\u201d with \u201ca leader who I think ... really is not much of a leader at all and very untrustworthy.\u201d",
      "The 50-year-old Naval Academy graduate pledged to improve economic opportunities and work with anyone on Capitol Hill. But she offered no apology for her desire to hold Trump accountable. That includes her role investigating Trump and his supporters, who ransacked the Capitol and tried to help the Republican president overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cPeople said to me at the time, \u2018You might not get reelected,\u2019\u201d said Luria, who twice voted to impeach Trump and publicly detailed the 187 minutes Trump made no public statement to stop the riots. \u201cYou know, I said, \u2018I don\u2019t care,\u2019 essentially. \u2018I\u2019m doing the right thing. The American people need to know what happened that day.\u2019\u201d",
      "Trump has said the sentences handed down to his supporters for their actions on Jan . 6, 2021, were \u201cridiculous and excessive\u201d and has defended his decision to grant clemency to people convicted of assaulting police officers during the attack.",
      "As Luria's first congressional campaign did in 2018, her announcement boosts Democrats who want center-left candidates to run in competitive districts \u2014 figures like her House freshman classmates, Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, who just won gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey, respectively.",
      "The Democratic Party's sweep in Virginia, Luria told the AP, \u201cdefinitely showed enthusiasm and support for the policies and the values that I represent.\u201d",
      "She stopped short of taking sides in the intraparty tussle between center-left moderates and progressives like New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist.",
      "\u201cThe right kind of profile for Democrats is someone who can speak to and match the interests of their district,\u201d Luria said, later adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t care less who the mayor of New York City is.\u201d",

      "Beyond domestic policy differences, Luria\u2019s bid serves as a reminder of how a Democratic House majority could use congressional subpoena and investigatory power with Trump still in office. Trump has continued flouting democratic standards in his second presidency, Luria said, while breaking his 2024 campaign promises to cut consumer costs.",
      "\u201c\u2018The violation of norms is really \u2014 it\u2019s almost like an understatement,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery single day, there\u2019s some new thing as a distraction for the fact that the administration is not doing what they told voters they were going to do.\u201d",
      "Noting rising costs for housing, groceries and utilities, Luria argued, \u201cAll of those really are caused by chaos, uncertainty created by this administration, and truly by the Republicans in Congress who have been sitting on their hands and just following along, waiting for their orders, essentially, from the White House.\u201d",

      "A little more than a year ago, Ryan Sprankle welcomed President Donald Trump to one of the three grocery stores his family owns near Pittsburgh. Trump was on the campaign trail; they talked about high grocery prices, and the Republican nominee picked up a bag of popcorn.",
      "But these days, Sprankle would have a different message if Trump or any lawmakers visited his store. He wants them to know that delayed SNAP benefits during the government shutdown hurt his customers and his small, independent chain.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t take away from the most needy people in the country. It\u2019s inhumane,\u201d Sprankle said. \u201cIt's a lack of empathy and it's on all their hands.",
      "The Trump administration froze funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October, impacting food access for some 42 million Americans. On Monday, the U.S. Senate passed legislation that would reopen the federal government and replenish SNAP funds, but the U.S. House of Representatives still must consider the bill. It's unclear when SNAP payments might resume if the government reopens.",
      "In 2024, SNAP recipients redeemed a little more than $96 billion in benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program. The majority \u2013 74% -- was spent at superstores and supermarkets, a category that includes big chains like Walmart and Kroger but also some independent stores like Sprankle's.",
      "Around 14% was spent at smaller grocery and convenience stores, businesses often tucked into neighborhoods and more easily accessible to SNAP beneficiaries.",
      "Etharin Cousin, a former director of the United Nations World Food Program and founder of the nonprofit Food Systems for the Future, said the cutoff of SNAP benefits had immediate impacts on grocers and convenience stores of all sizes, most of which operate on slim profit margins of 1% to 2%.",
      "\u201cSNAP isn\u2019t just a social safety net for families. It\u2019s also a local economic engine,\u201d Cousin said. \u201cSNAP benefits flow directly into neighborhoods, stores, regional distributors and community jobs.\u201d",
      "Walmart declined to comment on the impact of the SNAP funding lapse but noted that it has been lowering prices and donating to local food banks. Kroger also declined to comment.",
      "Shoppers not receiving their food benefits affects all retailers but becomes \u201ca big problem more quickly\u201d at small chains, Sprankle said. His Kittanning, Pennsylvania, store gets 25% of its revenue from SNAP, but customers who don't get government assistance also are worried about the shutdown, according to Sprankle. They're spending less, trading down to cheaper goods or heading to food banks, he said.",
      "Sprankle said lower sales cut into the overtime he can offer to the chain's 140 employees. Many are worried about losing their jobs, he said.",

      "Kanbe\u2019s also distributes free food to 50 food pantries and soup kitchens around the city.",
      "Kaniger said some of the convenience stores he works with saw their sales drop 10% in the days after Nov. 1, when SNAP benefits weren't paid. At the same time, the food pantries he supplies asked for double or triple their usual orders.",
      "Because it's giving away more food than usual, Kanbe\u2019s has to spend more buying produce for the coolers it stocks. It\u2019s frustrating for Kaniger, who must make decisions quickly before food spoils.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former aide to two New York governors is set to go on trial Wednesday on charges she sold her influence to the Chinese government and illegally profited from the state\u2019s bulk purchase of face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Linda Sun and her husband, Chris Hu, were arrested last year during a U.S. crackdown on alleged secret agents working for the Chinese government. They were charged again in June as part of the government\u2019s efforts to root out pandemic fraud.",
      "Sun, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, held numerous state government posts in New York over a roughly 15-year career, including as deputy chief of staff to Gov. Kathy Hochul and deputy diversity officer under former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, both Democrats.",
      "Sun has pleaded not guilty to charges alleging she violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act, conspired with her husband to commit money laundering and helped people commit visa fraud to enter the U.S. illegally. Hu has pleaded not guilty to charges including money laundering, tax evasion, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and misuse of identification. Neither has been charged with espionage.",

Schaeffer, wrote in a court filing that unsuccessfully sought to dismiss the case.",
      "Schaeffer contends the government charged Sun not because she was acting as a foreign agent, but because she and her family \u201chad too much money.\u201d The case, he wrote, is filled with \u201cglaring inconsistencies\" and some charges either fail to meet legal thresholds or are barred by the statute of limitations.",
      "Opening statements are set for Wednesday morning in Brooklyn federal court. A jury was picked on Monday. Judge Brian Cogan has said he expects the trial to take several weeks.",

      "In return, Hu got help for his business activities in China \u2014 a financial boost that prosecutors said allowed the couple to buy their multimillion-dollar property on Long Island, a condominium in Hawaii for $1.9 million, and luxury cars including a 2024 Ferrari, prosecutors said.",
      "Sun also received smaller gifts, the indictment said, including tickets to performances by a visiting Chinese orchestra and ballet groups and \u201cNanjing-style salted ducks\u201d that were prepared by the personal chef of a Chinese government official and delivered to Sun\u2019s parents\u2019 home in New York.",

But, according to the indictment, she also forged documents to falsely claim that Chinese contacts had suggested two additional companies. One was run by Sun\u2019s second cousin, and the other by Hu's business associate, the indictment said.",

      "In 2010, the Department of Mental Health had its budget cut by $40 million in the wake of the recession. At least 10 state-run psychiatric facilities have closed over the past three decades, leaving only three inpatient facilities with 504 total beds, and just one where men facing criminal charges can receive treatment to restore them to competency.",
      "The lawsuit that led to the consent decree was filed in 2016, alleging delays at every point in the process that violated constitutional due process.",
      "First, there was a wait for psychiatric evaluations. Then if deemed unfit for trial, there was a wait for a spot at the lone secure facility that serves men: Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility. Finally, anyone deemed unable to be restored to competency for trial had to wait for longer-term treatment at community based facilities.",

      "\u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive\u201d Subrina Hamilton, one of Clark's other sisters said, but \u201cthese people in the jail don\u2019t know that.\u201d",
      "His sisters wanted to see him but they weren't on his list of visitors. Another sister, Tameka Clark, would call the jail regularly to check up on him, assured by jail staff that her younger brother was \u201cfine.\u201d",
      "But on Dec. 11, 2024, Clark was found unresponsive in his cell. The temperature in the cell had risen to 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.3 degrees Celsius) at a time when boiler repairs were being done. His autopsy lists congestive heart failure as his cause of death, but Tom Andrew, a forensic pathologist who reviewed the autopsy for The Associated Press, said it left \u201cmore questions than answers.\"",
      "Clark\u2019s autopsy said he had access to water but didn\u2019t give specifics. Given the temperature in his cell, Andrew said, it was \u201cproblematic\u201d that the autopsy didn\u2019t record Clark\u2019s internal body temperature or rule out other signs of dehydration.",
      "Additionally, Andrew noted, jail staff was giving Clark antipsychotic medication at the time of his death that sometimes impairs the body\u2019s ability to regulate temperature, making him especially vulnerable to overheating.",
      "The state law enforcement agency investigating Clark\u2019s death declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation. Montgomery County Sheriff Derrick Cunningham also declined to comment specifically on Clark's death.",
      "Cunningham said jails are ill-equipped to deal with men like Clark as they wait for psychiatric beds. Jails have difficulty identifying mental health issues, administering medication and navigating complicated behavioral issues, he said.",
      "Even with the significant improvements the department is making, Cunningham said, jails will continue to struggle.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the number of beds we got and then the wait time, I mean, it\u2019s still not enough,\u201d he said.",

      "\"Ninety-seven percent could not distinguish between music entirely generated by AI and human-created music,\" said Deezer in a statement.",
      "The survey was conducted between October 6 and 10 in eight countries: Brazil, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and the United States.",
      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",

      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Kirkland, a onetime model who turned to acting and was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna,\" has died, her representative confirmed to the Associated Press. She was 84.",
      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",
      "Kirkland volunteered for people who had AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for inmates, especially young people.",

      "\"It really is an absolute rewiring of how you move through your life,\" LaRue told \"CBS Mornings\" on Tuesday. \"There's no way to ever go back to innocence.\"",
      "In 2007 LaRue, who starred in \"CSI: Miami,\" and her young daughter, Kaya, first started getting threatening phone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Her story is told in a new two-part documentary called \"My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story.\"",
      "\"What is crazy is we, on 'CSI: Miami,' we were solving cases in 43 minutes, not including commercials. In real life we did not have the technology we were pretending to have on the show,\" LaRue said.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning actress said she and her daughter had to move twice. At one point, her stalker found her daughter's high school and pretended to be her father, \"and told her to stand out in front of the school and he was going to pick her up.\"",
      "The stalking went on for more than a decade and affected her physically, causing hair loss and hives.",
      "\"There was no place to hide because you don't know where he could be, so you are really in a prison of your own making because you are trying to be four steps ahead of what he could do and those possibilities are endless,\" she said.",
      "\"Take my life back\"",
      "LaRue described a moment of an epiphany when a friend invited her and her daughter to Italy while \"CSI: Miami\" wasn't filming.",
      "\"We weren't there 36 hours, in the middle of the night, it's like 3 in the morning and I have jet lag and I'm kind of awake and rolling around. The bedroom door opens up and it is lit from the back,\" she said, explaining she couldn't see the individual's face at the door, but thought it was her friend.",
      "The next morning, she found out it was a break-in \u2014 but not her stalker.",
      "\"All I had done was pray all day and all night for months at that point for some sort of guidance. I really felt like it was my answer that God literally said in that moment, 'If I wanted you dead, I'll follow you to Italy,'\" she said.",
      "\"So I felt in that moment, oddly enough, this weird sense of peace. That was the first time I could kind of take my life back.\"",
      "Stalker arrest and moving forward",
      "LaRue's stalker was caught in 2019 through DNA, 12 years after the threats began.",
      "James David Rogers of Ohio was sentenced to 40 months in prison in 2022 \u2014 but is now out.",
      "Asked if she feels safe, LaRue said, \"I don't think we'll ever feel safe.\"",
      "\"Your brain never goes back to not being hyper vigilant,\" she said about moving forward.",
      "She said she almost didn't do the documentary and understands why some celebrities don't.",
      "\"They just hope that it goes away, that they stop obsessing, but obsession is a mental health issue. They just move on to a new obsession.\"",

    "story": [
      "As a public figure with a massive social media following, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to threats and abuse online. But recently, the entrepreneur says he's become \"far more aware\" of how he could face these threats in everyday life.",
      "\"You know, you start getting into these yahoos on social media, and there's, like, yahoos,\" Portnoy told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. \"I don't even know what they're saying. But they start talking about me, trying to get my name probably used because they're just in this endless cycle of needing to stay in the news.\"",
      "Conversations about him can quickly spiral online and \"open the floodgates on just lunatics,\" Portnoy said. In response, the businessman and social media personality said he has installed round-the-clock security at his house. \"It only takes one,\" Portnoy added.",
      "Recently, a man was overheard on video shouting an antisemitic comment and throwing coins toward Portnoy while he was recording his famous \"One Bite\" pizza review outside of a Mississippi restaurant. Starkville Police on Monday arrested the alleged heckler, identified as 20-year-old Patrick McClintock, on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace.",
      "\"Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",
      "\"Imagine hating somebody just because of their religion in this f---ing country,\" Portnoy said in a social media video posted after the incident.",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased almost 900% in the past 10 years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in many cases involving violence.",
      "Even before that recent incident, there had been a \"definitive shift\" toward antisemitism, Portnoy told Dokoupil, adding that it was a form of hate that he experiences on a daily basis.",
      "\"For me, being a Jewish person, like, you got to step up,\" he said. \"You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be, like, 'All right, this is not normal ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 10:07:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The actor, writer and musician has been an unconventional and unforgettable presence, from his Oscar-winning \"Sling Blade,\" to his rock band, The Boxmasters. He's now back in Season 2 of the Paramount+ series \"Landman,\" set in the oil fields of West Texas.",
    "story": [
      "Billy Bob Thornton's irreverence mixes with his Southern charm like a good ol' whiskey sour. After all, he can deliver lines with a sincerity that is almost mocking. He even, with a wink and a nod, played a not-so-saintly St. Nick. Some saw that as a brave choice. He doesn't. \"A brave choice is to see someone being attacked in a park and go intervene; that's a brave choice,\" he said. \"It's not a brave choice to do some weird thing in the middle of a scene, you know what I mean?\"",
      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "summary": "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Oscar-nominee Jessie Buckley's latest role, playing the wife of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet,\" may change that.",
    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",

    "story": [
      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "Outkast don't perform, but appear together",

      "Andre 3000 gave a long, rambling funny speech \u2014 \"I'm freestylin' y'all!\" \u2014 that ended in tears when he talked about their very beginnings in a basement \"dungeon\" in Atlanta in the early 1990s.",
      "He choked out the words, \"Great things start in little rooms.\"",

      "Meg White not in attendance for induction of The White Stripes",
      "The White Stripes reunion that some fans had hoped for didn't happen. Their induction was among the highlights of the night anyway.

      "Rodgers had to skip the ceremony because of health issues and Ralphs died earlier this year, so drummer Simon Kirke was the only member who took the stage.",
      "He was joined by an ad hoc super group that blasted through a few of the super group's biggest hits.",
      "Black Crowes singer Chris Robinson took lead vocals on their hit \"Feel Like Makin' Love,\" with Nancy Wilson of Heart and Joe Perry of Aerosmith on guitars. Bryan Adams took the stage to sing \"Can't Get Enough.\"",

      "\"He's never going away,\" Bruce Springsteen said in a recorded tribute. \"He's got a body of work that's as good as anybody's.\"",
      "Letterman outlined several categories of Zevon's cleverly emotional tunes, the final one being \"songs about werewolves\" to a big laugh from the crowd. 1978's \"Werewolves of London\" was Zevon's biggest, and most unlikely, hit.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

    "summary": "India's capital Delhi is blanketed in toxic smog every autumn, but the pollution is already so bad that it's drawn protests as authorities tell students to stay home.",
    "story": [
      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

Among them: Carrie Richardson, now 44, whose family carries the PSEN1 gene, making them genetically predisposed to developing early-onset Alzheimer's.",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:22:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 22:42:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A government funding package signed by President Trump on Wednesday will reopen federal agencies, opening the door for food-stamp recipients to collect their full benefits.",
    "story": [
      "After weeks of uncertainty, millions of Americans will soon start receiving federal nutrition assistance benefits again, after President Trump on Wednesday night signed a bill passed by Congress to end the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "The legislation, which the Senate approved on Monday, will restore Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits for November. It also calls for state governments to be reimbursed for any funds they spent to run programs usually paid for by the federal government.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last month that it would not fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, for November if the shutdown continued. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits to help pay for groceries.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to extend a pause of a federal judge's ruling that ordered the Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits in November. Adding to the confusion for food-stamp recipients, some states have since issued full benefits for November, while others have sent only partial or no payments.",
      "A USDA spokesperson told CBS News that SNAP recipients in most states will get their benefits \"within 24 hours\" after the government shutdown ends. The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News they expect the flow of benefits to start relatively quickly once the shutdown ends, but noted that the exact timeline could differ by state.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger, said states that have already attempted to issue the full November payment should be able to move fast, while others may need a few days to deal with administrative issues.",
      "\"States that did not issue full benefits earlier will need to resubmit their files to their EBT vendors for processing, which may take a few additional days,\" she said.",
      "Crystal FitzSimons, president of FRAC, recommended that food-stamp participants check their state family and social services websites for updates on when payments will go out.",
      "SNAP timing differs by state",
      "At least 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, according to The Associated Press. That funding was distributed in the short window between a Nov. 6 court ruling that required the federal government to make full SNAP payments and a ruling the following day by the Supreme Court that blocked the lower court's order.",
      "In addition, 16 states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits, the AP reported.",
      "Although federal agencies could soon be set to reopen, experts said the interruption in nutrition aid has already hurt many Americans who lean on SNAP to put food on the table.",
      "\"You can't eat retroactively when your SNAP was delayed,\" Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, told CBS News. \"Getting your [delayed] benefits is better than never getting them at all, but it doesn't help the harm that you experienced in the past.\"",

      "Commercial air travel around the U.S. isn't expected to return to normal\u00a0immediately after the U.S. government reopens, according to aviation experts.",
      "The government shutdown has snarled airport operations across the country, leading to flight delays and cancellations. While a vote to reopen the government would come as a relief to consumers, as well as to air traffic controllers and other Transportation Department personnel tasked with working without pay during the impasse, the system will take some time to recover.",
      "\"My guess is it's going to take a couple weeks,\" aviation security expert Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told CBS News. \"They have to get people back in places, airplanes back in places. This is non-trivial.\"",
      "He likened the process of ramping operations back up to turning a dial, rather than \"flicking a switch,\" noting that some airlines may have sent planes for maintenance as the Federal Aviation Administration throttled air traffic\u00a0at major airports last week because of the shutdown.",
      "\"They didn't furlough crew and put equipment away, but they might have put it in heavy maintenance,\" Jacobson said.",
      "Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, said the flying public should expect it \"to take many weeks\" for air travel to return to normal.",
      "\"It definitely won't happen immediately,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The FAA slowed flight traffic to maintain safety standards after more air traffic controllers than usual called out sick as they worked without pay during the lapse in funding. The U.S. has long faced a shortage of air traffic controllers, a deficit exacerbated by the shutdown.",
      "\"We had a serious shortage of controllers before the shutdown. We have a worse shortage after, because the rate of controller retirements has increased during the shutdown,\" Poole said.",
      "Resuming paychecks for federal workers will incentivize air traffic controllers who called out sick to return to their jobs, according to experts. But back pay that workers are entitled to once the shutdown concludes might not arrive immediately, slowing how quickly operations can rebound.",
      "\"At the very least, it's likely that air traffic controllers will need to see back pay in their bank accounts before the higher-than-usual callout rates end,\" Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine, told CBS News.",
      "In the near term, passengers looking ahead to upcoming trips should prepare to face continued disruptions, he added.",
      "\"The U.S. aviation system runs on precise coordination, and once that rhythm is broken, it won't bounce back overnight,\" Kheel said. \"From a passenger perspective, the first few days after the shutdown ends will likely see longer lines, reduced staffing and ongoing delays as the system recalibrates to full capacity.\"",

    "summary": "A class action lawsuit filed in a New York federal court on Wednesday claims Amazon uses a \"punitive absence control system\" against its employees.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon was sued on Wednesday in a proposed class action lawsuit that alleges the e-commerce giant has used \"punitive attendance policies\" against its employees.",
      "The complaint claims Amazon uses an automated system to track employee attendance, and then threatens employees with discipline and possible termination when they make legally protected accommodation requests.",
      "\"Under this system, employees live under constant threat of punishment if they get sick or injured or need time off to care for a family member,\" the filing claims, adding that the company's policies discourage employees from exercising their legal rights.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Amazon's practices violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and two other New York state laws governing disability discrimination and workplace absence policies.",
      "\"It's basically putting workers in the position of needing to choose between their safety and their paycheck,\" said Inimai Chettiar, the president of the nonprofit legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, which helped file the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed response to CBS News, Amazon denied the allegations.",
      "\"Claims that we don't follow federal and state laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) are simply not true,\" the company said. \"Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and we're committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone.\"",
      "Amazon added, \"Our dedicated Accommodations team reviews each request individually to make sure employees have access to the accommodations and adjustments they need, and we continuously evaluate our approach to best address their needs.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York by a woman named Cayla Lyster, who started working as an Amazon employee in 2022 in upstate New York. Lyster, who has a permanent genetic connective-tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, said in the lawsuit that she requested certain accommodations from Amazon in 2023, including a chair to sit on, which Amazon allegedly delayed.",
      "Lyster claims Amazon asked inappropriate questions about her medical condition, docked her unpaid time off (UPT) and then threatened her with discipline and termination while she was waiting for her accommodation request to be approved.",
      "\"Ms. Lyster came perilously close to termination for her UPT deductions while on an unwanted, unpaid waiting period pending accommodation, despite several attempts to communicate with Amazon and explain her absences,\" the lawsuit says.",
      "Lyster is requesting compensatory and punitive damages as well as a jury trial.",
      "The lawsuit comes after a five-year investigation by A Better Balance, which claims it documented hundreds of abuses against pregnant and disabled Amazon workers who requested time off.",
      "\"The case that we filed today is specifically about workers with disabilities, but this is part of a broader issue at Amazon around their attendance and disciplinary policies,\" Chettiar said.",

    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 13:05:28 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "On Wednesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News that the rebates would likely be given to families making \"less than, say, $100,000.\"",
      "That threshold is still in discussion, though, Bessent added.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",
      "Edited by\n                                        \n                                  Aimee  Picchi",

    "summary": "The president is hosting some of the nation's top financiers for a White House dinner Wednesday as part of his effort to bring manufacturing back home.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",
      "JPMorgan Chase reported this month that it was \"responding to requests from government authorities\" regarding its internal policies.",

      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",

    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 14:45:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable?",
      "The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan. Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "Addressing the affordability crisis",
      "The 50-year mortgage proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",
      "Mr. Trump defended the 50-year mortgage in a Fox News\u00a0interview\u00a0on Monday after host Laura Ingraham questioned the president over criticisms of the plan. Ingraham noted that some in his MAGA base argue the proposal would benefit banks while making it take longer for Americans to fully own their homes.",
      "\"It's not even a big deal,\" Mr. Trump said in response. \"You go from 40 to 50 years, and what it means is you pay something less.\"",

    "summary": "After Sonder said it was shutting down, one guest told CBS News he returned to his short-term rental to find his luggage in the hallway.",
    "story": [
      "Sonder, a short-term rental company and former Airbnb rival, abruptly went out of business after Marriott ended its licensing deal on Nov. 9 \u2014 leaving guests scrambling as they were told to vacate their rooms immediately, according to accounts shared with CBS News and on\u00a0social media.",
      "Paul Strack, 63, visiting Boston from Little Rock, Arkansas, told CBS News he received an email from Marriott on Sunday about his Sonder stay, but he initially mistook it for a scam. The email said that Marriott's agreement with Sonder had ended, and that \"we are unable to continue your reservation beyond today.\"",
      "\"[W]e are kindly requesting that you check out of the property as soon as you are able,\" the email read, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "Because he had mistaken it for spam, he ignored it. But on Monday, after exploring Boston and returning to the family's accommodation at the end of the day, Strack found his room's door wide open and his family's belongings packed up and left in a hallway.",
      "\"Even our dirty clothes and toiletries were packed up, and our laptops were in plastic bags,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Sonder on Monday said\u00a0it would wind down operations immediately, and that it expects to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy to liquidate its U.S. assets. The company describes itself as a global operator of \"premium, design-forward apartments and intimate boutique hotels serving the modern traveler\" that has faced financial challenges related to its agreement with Marriott, which the hotel chain terminated on Sunday.",
      "\"We are devastated to reach a point where a liquidation is the only viable path forward,\" Janice Sears, interim chief executive officer of Sonder said in a statement Monday. \"Unfortunately, our integration with Marriott International was substantially delayed due to unexpected challenges in aligning our technology frameworks, resulting in significant, unanticipated integration costs, as well as a sharp decline in revenue arising from Sonder's participation in Marriott's Bonvoy reservation system.\"",
      "\"We explored all viable alternatives to avoid this outcome, but we are left with no choice other than to proceed with an immediate wind-down of our operations and liquidation of our assets,\" she added.",
      "Strack, who said he'd booked Sonder residences in the past, and until recently had enjoyed the experiences, was frustrated by his subsequent interactions with Marriott personnel, which he called \"not helpful.\"",
      "Marriott did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on its communications with Sonder guests after ending the partnership.",
      "Marriott recommended he stay at a nearby property for the remainder of the family's stay, according to Strack, which he estimated would have cost around $700 a night.",
      "Ultimately, the family spent their final night in Boston in the room that they had been kicked out of.",

      "Wendy's plans to close hundreds of U.S. restaurants in the coming months as revenue and profits decline, with the company citing cutbacks by lower-income consumers that it expects will persist through year's end.",
      "On a Friday investor call, Ken Cook, Wendy's interim CEO, didn't disclose the exact number or locations of restaurants that it plans to shutter. But he said the Dublin, Ohio-based company is likely to close in the \"mid-single digit percentage\" of its 6,011 U.S locations, or roughly 300 store closures if it shuts 5% of its existing restaurants.",
      "Wendy's said the closures will start in the fourth quarter this year. Closing underperforming locations will improve traffic and profitability at its remaining U.S. restaurants, Cook added.",
      "Fast-food chains have been struggling to lift sales as lower-income consumers feel increasingly squeezed by rising food costs. Both Wendy's and McDonald's have introduced value meals to entice diners, but Cook said he doesn't expect the financial strain on these households to ease soon.",
      "\"We do see more pressure on the lower-income consumer,\" he said Friday. \"We continued to see that in [the third quarter] and we expect that to continue into the fourth.\"",
      "The new round of closures comes on top of the closure of 240 U.S. Wendy's locations in 2024. At the time, Wendy's said that many of the 55-year-old chain's restaurants are simply out of date.",
      "Cook became Wendy's CEO in July after the company's previous CEO, Kirk Tanner, left to become the president and CEO of Hershey Co.",
      "Cook said in some cases, Wendy's will make improvements to struggling stores, including adding technology or equipment. In other cases, it will transfer ownership to a different operator or close the restaurant altogether.",
      "\"When we look at the system today, we have some restaurants that do not elevate the brand and are a drag from a franchisee financial performance perspective. The goal is to address and fix those restaurants,\" Cook said during a conference call with investors.",
      "In the first nine months of this year, Wendy's said its U.S. same-store sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, fell 4% compared to the same period last year. Wendy's revenue fell 2% to $1.63 billion in the same period, while its net income fell 6% to $138.6 million.",
      "Cook said $5 and $8 meal deals \u2014 which have been matched by McDonald's \u2014 have helped bring some traffic back to its U.S. stores. But Wendy's isn't doing a good job of bringing in new customers, Cook said, so the company plans to shift its marketing to emphasize its value and the freshness of its ingredients.",

    "story": [
      "An outbreak of botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula has made at least 15 infants sick in 12 states, a California health official said Monday. The company announced Tuesday that it is expanding its voluntary recall to include all products while the investigation continues.",
      "Nine cases of infant botulism type A have been confirmed, with results on six others pending, said Dr. Erica Pan, health officer for the California Department of Public Health. That's an increase from 13 cases in 10 states reported on Saturday.",
      "Federal and state officials are investigating the outbreak, which began in mid-August. No deaths have been reported.",
      "ByHeart, a maker of organic baby formula based in New York, initially recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula over the weekend. It has now expanded that recall to include all batches of ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula cans and Anywhere Packs nationwide.",
      "\"The safety and well\u2011being of every infant who uses our formula is, and always will be, our highest priority,\" Mia Funt, co\u2011founder and president of ByHeart, said in a statement. \"This nationwide recall reflects our commitment to protecting babies and giving families clear, actionable information. Alongside this recall, we are conducting a comprehensive investigation to do our part to get the answers parents expect and deserve.\"",
      "\"Consumers in possession of this product should stop using it immediately,\" California officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the outbreak and infant botulism",
      "The outbreak has sickened babies aged 2 weeks to 5 months since mid-August. The infants were hospitalized after consuming ByHeart powdered formula, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart baby formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that causes the toxin linked to the outbreak. The tests to confirm contamination involve injecting mice with the cultured bacterium and then waiting up to four days to see if they get sick.",
      "\"These mice got sick really quickly,\" Pan said in an interview.",
      "ByHeart officials called for testing of unopened cans of formula. \"Testing unopened cans will provide reliable evidence that will help bring clarity to families who are understandably concerned,\" the company said in a statement Monday.",
      "At least 84 babies in the U.S. have been treated for botulism since August, California officials said. That includes those confirmed to have been fed ByHeart formula. The FDA is investigating whether any of the others are also linked to the same baby formula.",
      "Infant botulism typically affects fewer than 200 babies in the U.S. each year. It is caused by a type of bacterium that produces a toxin in the large intestine. The bacterium is spread through hardy spores present in the environment that can cause serious illness, including paralysis.",
      "Infants younger than 1 are particularly vulnerable to infection because their gut microbiomes are not developed enough to prevent the spores from germinating and producing the toxin. They can be sickened after exposure to the spores in dust, dirt or water or by eating contaminated honey.",
      "Symptoms can take weeks to develop and can include poor feeding, loss of head control, drooping eyelids and a flat facial expression. Babies may feel \"floppy\" and can have problems swallowing or breathing.",
      "No known outbreaks of infant botulism tied to powdered formula have previously been confirmed, said Dr. Steven Abrams, a University of Texas nutrition expert.",
      "\"This would be extremely rare,\" he said.",
      "The only treatment is known as BabyBIG, an IV medication made from the pooled blood plasma of adults immunized against botulism. California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program developed the product and is the sole source worldwide.",
      "BabyBIG works to shorten hospital stays and decrease the severity of illness in babies with botulism. Because the infection can affect the ability to breathe, infants often need to be placed on ventilators.",
      "All of the children in the ByHeart outbreak have received the medication, the CDC said. The treatment is delivered in vials that cost $69,300 apiece, Pan said.",
      "There is little danger of infant formula shortages because of this outbreak. ByHeart, which was founded in 2016, accounts for an estimated 1% of national formula sales, according to the CDC. The company sells formula through its website and in retail stores nationwide.",
      "That's far different from the crises in late 2021 and 2022, when four infants were sickened by a different germ after consuming formula made by Abbott Nutrition. Two of the babies died. No direct link was found between the Abbott products and the infections caused by cronobacter sakazakii, but FDA officials closed the company's Michigan plant after contamination and other problems were detected.",
      "Abbott's recall involved top-selling brands of infant formula, triggering a massive nationwide shortage that lasted months.",
      "In 2022, ByHeart recalled five batches of infant formula after a sample at the company's packaging plant tested positive for cronobacter sakazakii, the germ at the heart of the Abbott crisis. In 2023, the FDA sent a warning letter to the company detailing \"areas that still require corrective actions.\"",
      "Federal health officials have vowed to overhaul the U.S. food supply and are taking a new look at infant formula.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has directed the FDA to review the nutrients and other ingredients in infant formula, which fills the bottles of millions of American babies.",
      "The effort, dubbed \"Operation Stork Speed,\" is the first deep look at the ingredients since 1998.",

      "Turkeys aren't known for flying but their prices are soaring ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.",

      "The wholesale price is what retailers pay to buy items in bulk. Retailers then decide how much they want to charge consumers.",
      "The reason the birds \u2014 traditionally the centerpiece at the Thanksgiving table \u2014 are getting more expensive comes down to supply. The number of available turkeys has shrunk in recent years amid slightly weakened demand and avian flu outbreaks, according to USDA\u00a0data.",
      "More than 3 million turkeys have been impacted by bird flu outbreaks this year, including over half a million this month alone, USDA data shows.",
      "That translates to fewer turkeys: USDA forecasts that farmers raised around 195 million turkeys in 2025 compared with 200 million in 2024, a 3% decrease. To be sure, the number of turkeys in supply has been sliding over the last decade. In 2016, farmers raised around 245 million turkeys, roughly 50 million more than today's supply.",
      "Deals abound",
      "Amid the rise in wholesale turkey prices, several companies are floating deals in an attempt to win over budget-conscious customers.",
      "Walmart announced Tuesday that it is offering Butterball turkeys for $0.97 per pound this year. The retailer also said its 10-person meal deal will cost under $4 per person. Grocery chain Aldi has\u00a0offered a similar deal, at $40 for 10 people.",
      "\"Retailers typically use turkeys as a loss leader,\" David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University, told CBS News. \"That is, they price them very competitively \u2014 sometimes even below cost \u2014 to draw shoppers into stores ahead of Thanksgiving.\"",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",

      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",

      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

    "story": [
      "A 208-year-old publication that farmers, gardeners and others keen to predict the weather have relied on for guidance has published for the final time.",
      "Farmers' Almanac said Thursday that its 2026 edition, which is already available, will be its last, citing the growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the book in today's \"chaotic media environment.\" Access to the online version will cease next month.",
      "The Maine-based publication, not to be confused with the even older Old Farmer's Almanac in neighboring New Hampshire, was first printed in 1818. For centuries, it's used a secret formula based on sunspots, planetary positions and lunar cycles to generate long-range weather forecasts.",
      "The almanac also contains gardening tips, trivia, jokes and natural remedies, like catnip as a pain reliever or elderberry syrup as an immune booster. But its weather forecasts make the most headlines.",
      "A goodbye piece titled \"A Fond Farewell\" says, \"The season we hoped would never come is here.\"",
      "In the piece, Editor Sandi Duncan and Editor Emeritus Peter Geiger say, \"We are incredibly proud of the legacy we leave behind and are filled with gratitude. We appreciate and thank our loyal readers, contributors, and partners who have supported us through the years. Though the Almanac will no longer be available in print or online, it lives on within you.\"",
      "Separately, Duncan wrote,\u00a0\"It is with a heavy heart that we share the end of what has not only been an annual tradition in millions of homes and hearths for hundreds of years, but also a way of life, an inspiration for many who realize the wisdom of generations past is the key to the generations of the future.\"",
      "In 2017, when Farmers' Almanac reported a circulation of 2.1 million in North America, its editor said it was gaining new readers among people interested in where their food came from and who were growing fresh produce in home gardens.",
      "Many of these readers lived in cities, prompting the publication to feature skyscrapers as well as an old farmhouse on it final cover.",

      "The funding package that ended the longest government shutdown in modern U.S. history picked up support from a half-dozen Democrats \u2014 mostly moderates who represent competitive districts \u2014 when it passed the House late Wednesday.",
      "The bill, which President Trump signed into law on Wednesday, will keep the government open until Jan. 30. It also reverses federal layoffs during the shutdown, and includes three-year-long funding bills that cover military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "It passed the Senate earlier this week after negotiations between Republicans and eight members of the chamber's Democratic caucus, who voted for the bill in exchange for a promise by the GOP to hold a separate vote on extending expiring health insurance tax credits.",
      "Here's a look at the House Democrats who voted yes:",
      "Jared Golden of Maine",
      "Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, a moderate representing the largely rural northernmost reaches of New England, was the sole House Democrat to vote in favor of a GOP-backed measure in September that would have averted the government shutdown. When the shutdown began last month, he blamed it on \"hardball politics\" by \"far-left groups.\"",
      "In a social media post after Wednesday's vote, he said he \"voted to reopen the government, pay federal workers, and get food assistance and other critical programs up and running again.\"",
      "He also urged lawmakers to \"take immediate action\" to extend the health insurance subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of this year.",
      "\"We still have a window to pass bipartisan legislation to extend these credits,\" he said.",
      "Golden won reelection last year by 0.6 percentage points, or just under 3,000 votes. In the same year, Mr. Trump won in Golden's district by about 9 points. He said last week he will not run for reelection next year, a move he linked in part to the \"unnecessary, harmful\" shutdown.",
      "Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington",
      "Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, who is known for occasionally breaking with her party, said in a statement she \"voted to end this partisan car crash of a shutdown.\"",
      "\"Americans can't afford for their Representatives to get so caught up in landing a partisan win that they abandon their obligation to come together to solve the urgent problems that our nation faces,\" she wrote. \"The last several weeks have been a case study in why most Americans can't stand Congress. None of my friends who rely on SNAP would want to trade their dinner for an ambiguous D.C. beltway 'messaging victory' and I'm glad this ugly scene is in the rearview mirror.\"",
      "She won reelection by 3.8 points last year, after initially getting elected to Congress by an 0.8-point margin in 2022.",
      "Henry Cuellar of Texas",
      "Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, who has represented the Rio Grande Valley for over 20 years, said in a statement that \"Washington's inaction created unnecessary hardship for the communities I represent,\" pointing to disruptions to food aid. He pressed Congress to extend the health insurance tax credits next.",
      "\"The problem is, when Democrats or Republicans think they're winning at the end of a long shutdown, it's the American public that loses,\" Cuellar told NewsNation after the vote.",
      "He won reelection by 5.6 points last year.",
      "Adam Gray of California",
      "Rep. Adam Gray of California explained his vote in an op-ed in the Turlock Journal, a newspaper in his Central Valley congressional district. He said he voted yes because the bill will keep the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funded until the end of September \u2014 preventing any more interruptions to food aid if there's another shutdown.",
      "\"No parent should have to choose between feeding their children and keeping the lights on because someone in Washington thinks chaos is a negotiating tactic,\" he wrote, blaming the Trump administration for \"using vulnerable Americans as political leverage.\"",
      "He later said, \"Is this a perfect deal? No. But lasting policy in this country is not born of hostage\u2011taking. It is born of compromise.\"",
      "He pressed for an extension to health insurance tax credits, but wrote: \"Protecting families from hunger today does not prevent us from lowering health care costs tomorrow.\"",
      "Gray won his first term in Congress by just 187 votes in 2024, after losing by a razor-thin 564 votes two years earlier.",
      "Don Davis of North Carolina",
      "Rep. Don Davis of North Carolina, whose already-competitive district was redrawn this year and made more favorable to Republicans, said an \"increasing number of families have shared with me that they have been suffering daily\" over the course of the shutdown.",
      "He said in a statement he voted for the bill to \"alleviate the suffering,\" and in the hopes that negotiations can take place on extending the health insurance subsidies.",
      "\"While some Washington politicians from both parties have failed rural communities, the battle for healthcare is not over,\" Davis wrote.",
      "Davis won reelection by 1.7 points last year.",
      "Tom Suozzi of New York",
      "Rep. Tom Suozzi of New York said on X after the House vote he's \"relying on the representations of some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that they want to get something done to extend the Premium Tax Credits.\"",
      "But he added that \"we cannot rely on the White House, which has chosen to make this process needlessly painful,\" noting the interruptions to food aid.",
      "Suozzi won reelection by 3.6 points in November. He previously represented his Long Island district for\u00a0 three terms, left Congress in 2023 to run for governor, and returned to the House in an early 2024 special election to replace the expelled GOP Rep. George Santos.",

      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told CBS News that Democrats will still press to extend a slate of expiring health insurance subsidies, as a 43-day-long government shutdown\u00a0comes to an end without the health care provisions that many in his party viewed as a dealbreaker.",
      "\"House Democrats are in this fight until we win this fight,\" Jeffries said in an interview with \"CBS Evening News\" anchor John Dickerson. \"This fight is not over for us. We're just getting started.\"",
      "Speaking hours before the House voted Wednesday evening on a bill that would fund the government until late January, Jeffries told CBS News that \"Democrats remain strongly opposed\" to the bill, which passed the Senate with some Democratic support. The House passed it 222 to 209 Wednesday night, with six Democrats breaking with their party to vote yes.",
      "Democrats in both the House and Senate had long pressed for Congress to extend Biden-era enhanced health insurance tax credits in exchange for their votes to reopen the government. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, which could lead to higher premiums for millions of people who buy insurance on Affordable Care Act exchanges.",
      "But over the weekend, eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus signed onto a bill to reopen the government and approve a trio of full-year spending bills, in exchange for a promise from Senate GOP leadership to hold a vote on the tax credits at some point. House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Asked by Dickerson what he's heard from constituents about the Senate Democrats who voted for that deal, Jeffries said he hasn't heard much, but his constituents do want Democrats to \"keep up the fight, protect the health care of the American people.\"",
      "\"Grocery costs are too high, utility bills and electricity bills are through the roof, and health care costs are way too high,\" said Jeffries. \"We need you to do something about it.\"",
      "The New York Democrat touted a separate bill that would extend the health insurance tax credits for three years.",
      "He said \"we're going to force Republicans to vote on that, if not today, at some point soon,\" referring to his plan to attempt to force a vote using a procedural move called a discharge petition. Jeffries will need several House Republicans to sign the petition, though.",
      "\"Republicans claim that they want to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" he said. \"They'll have an opportunity to do so, since their leadership refuses to do that.\"",
      "Asked if he believes the fight that led to the shutdown was worth it, Jeffries said Republicans were responsible.",

      "After 43 days and more than a dozen attempts to reopen the government, President Trump signed the funding package, passed by the Senate and House, into law late Wednesday, meaning the funding lapse is officially over.",
      "Here's how the shutdown started, and eventually came to an end:",
      "A Senate standoff",
      "The standoff began in late September as lawmakers faced a deadline to fund the government by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. House Republicans passed a short-term funding measure on Sept. 19 to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. But with Democratic support needed to move forward with any funding measure in the Senate, the chamber was at an impasse.",
      "The top Democrats in Congress had been pushing since August to meet with GOP leaders and the White House on the funding issue, ramping up their calls to address expiring health care tax credits as the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline drew near.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats set out to center health care issues in the funding fight \u2014 setting their sights on the expiring health insurance tax credits as their key demand. The credits, under the Affordable Care Act, help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. Their expiration would mean eye-popping increases in insurance costs for those with ACA plans.",
      "Months earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced intense pushback for voting to advance a GOP measure during the last funding fight, increasing the pressure on him to dig in this time around.",
      "Democrats sought to negotiate, introducing a counter-proposal to the House-passed measure to fund the government that included their health care demands. But Republicans remained steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a \"clean\" temporary funding extension.",
      "Over the course of seven weeks, Republicans and Democrats traded blame for the funding impasse. Senate Republicans put forward the House-passed funding measure for a vote 14 times, seeking to peel off support from Democrats as the caucus remained largely united in their opposition. But throughout it all, member-level bipartisan conversations seeking an offramp were bubbling under the surface.",
      "As the weeks dragged on, the real-world effects of the shutdown began to take their toll, raising the stakes for the continuing stalemate and pushing Democrats to make a deal. Millions of federal workers began missing paychecks, straining those with little savings or no access to credit. Chaos began to emerge at airports after the Trump administration said it would reduce flight traffic amid staffing shortages caused by strained air traffic controllers. And millions of Americans were at risk of losing access to food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "A bipartisan undercurrent",
      "As early as the first days of the shutdown, a small group of moderate senators began signaling tepid interest in finding a way out at the member level, while leaders refused to engage.",
      "What began as a large bipartisan huddle on the Senate floor would go on to involve a number of senators from across both the Democratic caucus and Republican conference.",
      "The conversations across the aisle ramped up as the shutdown neared the longest on record. Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Oct. 30 she had spoken with Schumer to \"lay the foundation\" on continued appropriations work. And although Schumer didn't vote for the final deal to end the shutdown, the long-term funding efforts became a key to unlocking an eventual agreement by demonstrating Republicans' willingness to work on the appropriations process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The contours of the eventual deal began to emerge during the first week of November, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside a trio of long-term appropriations bills. In exchange for their support, Democrats would be promised a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that they had demanded.",
      "Britt told reporters on Nov. 4 that she made calls through the prior weekend on the funding package, saying she was hopeful it could be part of what ends the stalemate. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican involved in the talks, said on the same day that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits. And Democrats involved in the talks generally remained tight-lipped, signaling that things were close.",
      "But the impasse would stretch on for a few more days, after Democrats swept key races in off-year elections. The victories emboldened the holdouts, who argued that voters had given them marching orders not to cave on their health care demands.",
      "Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear that he would not commit to a vote on the health insurance tax credits in the lower chamber. That comment underlined concerns from some Democrats that a future Senate vote on health care, which they were set to receive as part of a deal to reopen the government, would go nowhere.",
      "Still, the shutdown's toll on Americans continued to ratchet up pressure on senators to reach a resolution.",
      "On Nov. 7, Senate Democrats presented an offer to Republicans, saying they would end the government shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of the health care tax credits and a plan to continue broader talks. But the proposal was swiftly rejected by Republicans as a \"nonstarter,\" as Senate Majority Leader John Thune maintained the position that negotiations on health care could only come after the government reopened.",
      "The long-sought breakthrough",
      "On Nov. 9, the deal to end the shutdown finally came together, with a group of eight Democrats agreeing to advance a funding measure as part of a broader agreement to end the shutdown.",
      "Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck with Thune and the White House secured a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act tax credits. The deal attached the trio of full-year funding bills, while restoring food aid at higher levels, and paving the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills. And it reversed all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, while preventing them for a limited time going forward.",
      "The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused Schumer's offer \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure, arguing that continuing the shutdown would only inflict more pain without any hopes of a better deal.",
      "The final turn seemed to come with the provision in the bill that would address the Trump administration's layoffs. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the eight Democrats to back the funding deal, had long called the issue his principal priority in the shutdown fight. And he said he joined the group of Democrats just 48 hours before the deal was announced.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that the language in the new continuing resolution reversing the layoffs came from the White House. Mullin said the White House told Republicans they were willing to revert the layoffs if it could help win Kaine over.",
      "\"It was the right provision which brought him over, which brought a couple other people over, too,\" Mullin said. \"That's what got it over the finish line.\"",
      "With coordination with the House and White House, the deal was on a glidepath to passage in the lower chamber, and to swiftly secure the president's signature.",
      "The House passed the bill late Wednesday, and Mr. Trump signed it during an Oval Office ceremony hours later. He applauded congressional Republicans and the Democratic senators who voted for the deal, while lashing out at most other Democrats.",

    "story": [
      "The longest government shutdown in modern U.S. history came to a close Wednesday night when President Trump signed a bill to fund the government through Jan. 30 \u2014 ending a 43-day-long impasse that had imperiled air travel and left thousands without paychecks.",
      "The ordeal began in late September, after the GOP-led House\u00a0passed a measure that would have kept the government running through Nov. 21. The bill failed to make it out of the Senate, though, as most Democrats pushed for an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits.",
      "Senate Republicans were unable to garner the support they needed until Monday, when a group of Democrats crossed the aisle and voted to reopen the government until late January in exchange for a separate Senate vote on the health insurance credits. The House passed the bill two days later, also with some Democrats' support, sending it to Mr. Trump's desk.",
      "Here's a look at the government shutdown by the numbers:",
      "14: Number of failed Senate votes on funding the government",
      "Starting in mid-September, the Senate held 14 failed votes to advance the House-passed resolution to fund the government until late November \u2014 keeping the government closed for upward of a month with little movement.",
      "The Senate has 53 Republicans, 45 Democrats and two independents who caucus with the Democrats. Until last weekend, there were as many as 55 votes in favor of funding the government, five short of the 60 needed to move the bill forward.",
      "The Senate requires only a simple majority of 51 votes to pass most legislation. But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the House's continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators votes to end debate.",
      "Then, on Nov. 9, a deal to end the shutdown finally came together, with a group of seven Democrats and one independent who caucuses with Democrats agreeing to advance a funding measure as part of a broader agreement. On a 15th vote, the\u00a0measure finally advanced with 60 senators voting to end debate. The Senate passed the bill a day later, on Nov. 10.",
      "52: Senate Republicans supporting resolution to fund the government and end the shutdown",
      "1: Number of Senate Republicans who opposed the bill",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is the lone Republican joining most Democratic senators in voting against advancing the resolution to fund the government. He said he\u00a0opposes\u00a0the measure because it adds to the nation's rising debt.",
      "3: Senate Democrats/independents who supported the original resolution to fund the government",
      "Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada repeatedly voted with Republicans in support of the measure, as did independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "8: Senate Democrats/independents who voted to fund the government on Nov. 10",
      "On Nov. 9, King and Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire struck a deal with Senate Majority Leader John Thune and the White House to end the shutdown.",
      "The deal attached a trio of full-year funding bills to legislation that will reopen the government until Jan. 30, while restoring food aid at higher levels, and paving the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills. And it reversed all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, while preventing them for a limited time going forward.",
      "As part of the deal, Thune also agreed to hold a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act tax credits.",
      "Eight members of the Democratic caucus voted for the bill: Fetterman, Cortez Masto, King, Shaheen and Hassan, as well as Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Jackie Rosen of Nevada.",
      "6: House Democrats who voted to end the shutdown",
      "Six mostly moderate House Democrats voted in favor of the Senate-passed deal to end the shutdown when the House took up the bill on Nov. 12: Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Adam Gray of California, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington, Don Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Tom Suozzi of New York.",
      "All six represent swing districts, and Golden was the lone Democrat to vote in favor of the House GOP's initial funding package in September.",
      "2: House Republicans who voted against funding bill",
      "During the Nov. 12 vote, Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Greg Steube of Florida voted no.",
      "42 million: The number of people who stood to be cut off from full food stamp benefits on Nov. 1",
      "Roughly 42 million Americans rely on food stamps that arrive every month on their electronic benefit transfer cards, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But the USDA said last month that funding for the benefits, known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, had run out due to the shutdown.",
      "A USDA official overseeing SNAP said in a court filing last week that benefits were expected to be reduced by 35% in November.",
      "On Oct. 28, 25 states asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to order the Agriculture Department to provide benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for November, including by tapping into a contingency fund to ensure the assistance continues to flow to more than 25 million people living within their states' borders.",
      "A federal judge in Rhode Island ordered the USDA to use that contingency fund, which the Trump administration appealed. On Nov. 9, Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u00a0granted a stay on behalf of the court, blocking the lower court's order that the administration transfer some $4 billion from other food security programs to SNAP payments.",
      "After the stay was issued, the USDA ordered states to \"immediately undo any steps\" that were taken to provide full SNAP benefits. On Monday, with Congress on the cusp of a deal, the stay was extended.",
      "$9.2 billion: The cost of funding food stamps for November",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins estimated it would cost about $9.2 billion to keep SNAP benefits flowing through November. The Agriculture Department's contingency fund has around $5 billion, which Rollins has argued the administration doesn't have the legal ability to use.",
      "Some lawmakers from both parties called for standalone legislation to fund SNAP.",
      "At least 670,000: Government workers who have been furloughed since the shutdown began",
      "According to the Bipartisan Policy Center's analysis of daily Treasury statements and the center's own workforce estimates, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in September\u00a0that compensation for furloughed workers is roughly $400 million per day.",
      "About 730,000: Federal employees who worked without pay",
      "Government workers who are determined to be essential are still working, albeit without pay, and there are about 730,000 of these employees, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "Over 4,000: Federal workers the government disclosed it was trying to lay off during shutdown",
      "On Oct. 28, a judge indefinitely barred the Trump administration from firing government employees due to the shutdown while a lawsuit challenging the effort makes its way through the courts.",
      "In mid-October, the administration had already sent \"reduction in force\" layoff notices to more than 4,000 federal employees across seven agencies.",
      "Here are the approximate numbers:",
      "As part of the final bipartisan Senate deal, a provision was added that reversed any layoffs during the shutdown. The resolution also says that \"no federal funds may be used\" to conduct layoffs between now and Jan. 30.",
      "$130 million: The private donation Trump says he's used to help pay the military",
      "President Trump says an unnamed \"patriot\" donated $130 million to fund troops' paychecks, which are normally cut off during shutdowns. The New York Times reported that the donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",
      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP will face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO says.",

      "Fetterman voted with Republicans over a dozen times to fund the government and end the government shutdown while most Senate Democrats held out.

      "The deal reached in the Senate would extend government funding until Jan. 31, to give Congress more time to pass full appropriations bills. The bill does not extend health care tax credits for Affordable Care Act insurance, which Democrats had been demanding, but does guarantee a vote on the issue. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, when over 20 million Americans who purchase their own insurance through the ACA will see their premiums spike.",
      "The agreement also includes three full funding bills that lawmakers have been working on for months. The three bills include funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch. It would also ensure federal workers who were not paid during the shutdown will receive back pay. The bill will also reverse the layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the government shutdown and prevent any cuts until the end of January.",

      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "Health insurance played a central role in the shutdown fight. Most Democrats refused to back any deal to fund the government that didn't include an extension of Biden-era tax credits that expanded the subsidies available to Americans who buy their insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. If the credits expire, many people who rely on the tax credits could see their premiums double, according to KFF.",
      "The conflict ended after eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus agreed to reopen the government in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune to hold a separate vote on the tax credits. Most Democrats voted against that deal, which passed in both chambers this week.",

      "\"Not a single Republican in leadership talked to us about this or has given us a plan to help Americans deal with their health insurance premiums DOUBLING,\" she wrote on X last month in a post that noted she's \"not a fan\" of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Weeks later, she wrote: \"Apparently I have to go into a SCIF to find out the Republican healthcare plan,\" referring to the secure facilities that government agencies use to handle highly classified documents.",
      "Greene has also criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session during the shutdown: \"It's an embarrassment,\" she told \"The View,\" and she pushed Republicans to focus more on addressing the cost of living (\"I see Republicans losing the House if Americans are continuing to go paycheck-to-paycheck,\" she told Semafor).",
      "And she's suggested the Trump administration has focused too much on foreign policy in recent months, leading President Trump to say: \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "Over the course of the shutdown, Jeffries and other Democrats have regularly pointed to Greene, citing the hard-right lawmaker's comments on health care to back up their own views. It's an odd alliance, just under five years after House Democrats voted to take away Greene's committee assignments over conspiratorial statements she made before joining Congress.",

      "In exchange for their votes, Senate Republicans promised Democrats they would have a vote on tax credits that expire at the end of the year and help millions of Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Most Democrats opposed the deal, but the party now appears to be shifting focus to the upcoming fight over health care.",
      "The House's absence",
      "Arguing that the House had done its job after the mid-September vote, Johnson canceled weeks of votes and committee hearings were put on hold.",
      "\"We have a lot of business to do,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday. \"There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.\"",
      "Johnson's decision to cancel weeks in session fueled backlash from House Democrats, who have repeatedly called on the GOP leader to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who was elected to her late father's seat in Arizona on Sept. 23.",
      "Democrats, and some Republicans, saw Johnson's resistance to immediately swearing her in as an attempt to delay a vote on releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva will be the final signature on a discharge petition, spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, that will force a vote on the issue and could embarrass President Trump.",
      "Johnson also faced criticism from some Republicans over the House's lengthy absence.",
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Johnson's top GOP critics over the decision to keep members away from Washington, told \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" this week that Republicans' House majority \"is being ruined\" by \"inaction.\" Noting the September vote, Greene said the House hasn't \"been to work since.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who stayed in Washington over the shutdown, had argued that the shutdown could have ended sooner \"if we actually had the House of Representatives in town.\"",
      "In order to end the shutdown, Johnson will have to keep his often-divided conference together, which could prove easier with President Trump's backing of the Senate deal. The chamber is set to vote on the final version of the legislation on Wednesday.",
      "House Republicans can afford to lose only two votes if all members are present and voting. Two Republicans voted against the original version of the bill when it cleared the House on Sept. 19, though it also had the support of one Democrat.",
      "But lawmakers could face travel disruptions on their way back with thousands of flight delays and cancellations around the U.S. as the Federal Aviation Administration limits flights due to staffing issues caused by the shutdown. Johnson urged House members ahead of final passage in the Senate to begin traveling to Washington \"right now.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday he expects all members of his party will make it back in time for the vote.",
      "\"I expect that everyone's going to be back, and we'll be at full strength,\" Jeffries, who could face defections of his own during the vote, told reporters.",
      "The House will also have to confront the expiring health care subsidies in the coming weeks. Johnson has not committed to holding a vote on the issue if an extension makes it out of the Senate. Millions of Americans will see their insurance premiums skyrocket next year without an extension or other fix.",
      "Jeffries is considering a discharge petition to sidestep Johnson and force a vote on the expiring tax credits. Democrats would need the support of at least four Republicans.",

    "summary": "The three emails appear to be exchanges between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the author Michael Wolff and Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress. The House is set to return Wednesday for the first time since Sept. 19. The lower chamber has been away from Washington while the Senate worked through an impasse on reopening the government. The House's absence meant the newest member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was not sworn in, preventing her from becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Grijalva is expected to sign the petition after she's sworn in on Wednesday, starting the clock on the process to move forward with the bill. A vote likely wouldn't come until next month.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An effort to force a House vote on compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein secured the final signature it needed Wednesday after House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the swearing-in of a newly elected Democrat for seven weeks.",
      "The effort, known as a discharge petition, defies House GOP leaders, who have opposed putting legislation backed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on the floor. Khanna and Massie introduced the measure, titled the Epstein Files Transparency Act, in July as pressure intensified on the Trump administration to release more Epstein-related files.",
      "Their bill, as well as several other endeavors to release the materials, led to the disruption of several committee meetings and stalled floor action on other legislation before the House began its August recess days early.",
      "Massie vowed to keep the Epstein issue a priority and filed a discharge petition upon their return in early September. A discharge petition enables members of the lower chamber to bypass House leadership if they can get a majority of members \u2014 218 \u2014 to sign on.",
      "All House Democrats and four Republicans have added their names. Besides Massie, GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado have signed on. Two special elections in Virginia and Arizona in September provided the final two signatures from Democrats to reach the 218 threshold.",
      "Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who was elected on Sept. 23 to fill the seat of her late father Raul, added her name to the petition on Wednesday, shortly after she was sworn in. She pointed to Epstein survivors in the House gallery who she said were present for her swearing-in.",
      "\"Just this morning, House Democrats released more emails showing that Trump knew more about Epstein's abuses than he previously acknowledged,\" Grijalva said. \"It's past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we, the American people.\"",
      "The House has been on break since Sept. 19, when it voted to pass a Republican bill to avert the government shutdown. The House was scheduled to be back in late September, but GOP leaders had extended the break until this week to increase pressure on the Senate to pass a short-term funding measure.",
      "Supporters of the discharge petition interpreted the break as a move to avoid swearing in Grijalva, who had said she would add her name to the petition. Her signature on Wednesday starts the clock on a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can motion to bring it to the floor. After that, leadership has two legislative days to schedule a vote, putting the timeline for a vote as soon as early December.",
      "But Johnson said Wednesday night he would bypass the seven-day waiting period and put it on the floor next week.",
      "\"We're going to put that on the floor for a full vote next week, as soon as we get back,\" he told reporters.",
      "It's unclear if the Senate would take it up if it clears the House.",
      "\"I believe we're going to get 40, 50 Republicans voting with us on the release,\" Khanna told reporters Wednesday. \"And if we get that kind of overwhelming vote, that's going to push the Senate and it's going to push for a release of the files from the Justice Department.\"",
      "In September, Massie said GOP leaders were in \"full panic\" over the discharge petition and had \"actually threatened\" some of the cosigners \u2014 \"politically, not physically.\"",
      "The bipartisan legislation calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of sex trafficking. The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has opposed the legislation, arguing that it does not go far enough to protect victims. He has criticized the discharge petition as \"unnecessary,\" citing the House Oversight Committee's investigation into the Epstein case.",
      "During its investigation, the Oversight Committee has released tens of thousands of Epstein-related records, including a new trove of documents unveiled on Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Grijalva added her signature to the petition, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails exchanged between Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "The emails include a 2011 message from Epstein to Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted.

      "Despite President Trump's waves of pardons for allies and supporters who sought to overturn his 2020 election loss and his clemency for all Capitol riot defendants, at least one federal case with tethers to the 2020 election still lingered.",
      "Now, a federal judge in Houston has sentenced Abigail Shry to 27 months in federal prison, followed by two years of supervised release, after she pleaded guilty to phoning a vulgar, violent and racist threat to U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan in August 2023.",
      "The threat was made hours after Chutkan was assigned to oversee Mr. Trump's\u00a0criminal case\u00a0for allegedly conspiring to overturn his 2020 loss, of which Jan. 6 was a component.",
      "In court Wednesday before Judge Keith Ellison, Shry apologized to anyone who was subjected to hearing her \"abhorrent\" voicemail, saying that it \"was not and is not reflective of my character or beliefs.\"",
      "In charging documents, the Justice Department said Shry, 45, left a voicemail for Chutkan in which she threatened to kill anyone who \"went after President Trump.\"",
      "The document alleged Shry referred to Chutkan as a \"slave,\" used a racial epithet and made threats against a Texas Democratic congresswoman, \"all Democrats\" and the LGBTQ community.",
      "Shry's voice message also said, \"If Trump doesn't get elected in 2024, we are coming to kill you, so tread lightly,\" according to the Justice Department's court filings.",
      "Investigators say they linked the message to Shry after determining her cellphone number was used to make the threatening call.",
      "Shry pleaded guilty in November 2024 to a federal charge of transmitting an interstate threat. Her sentencing hearing had been postponed multiple times before Wednesday's court date. Prosecutors requested a sentence of 33 months.",
      "On the day of Shry's guilty plea, the Justice Department offered further details on its investigation, saying Shry admitted that she made the call and \"noted that she had no plans to travel anywhere to carry out anything she stated.\" But she also allegedly told investigators that \"if the congresswoman ever traveled to her city, then 'we need to worry.'\"",
      "Shry's case was one of a fast-rising number of threats made against federal judges in the past few years.

    "summary": "Israel's president says Trump sent him a letter asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "In a statement posted later Wednesday to X, Netanyahu thanked Mr. Trump for his \"incredible support,\" adding: \"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is. I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused his political opponents of using the Justice Department to target him during his time out of office, and since he returned to the White House, the department, now run by his appointees, has pushed for Biden-era justice officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In September, he\u00a0pushed\u00a0Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Comey and James have since been indicted on criminal charges.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is hosting a private White House dinner Wednesday with some of Wall Street's biggest names, as part of his effort to forge stronger ties with America's business leaders and convince them to invest in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, whose relationship with the president has had its ups and downs, will be attending, as well as Nasdaq CEO Adena Friedman, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone, Morgan Stanley's Ted Pick, BlackRock's Larry Fink and David Solomon of Goldman Sachs, sources familiar with the event planning said.",
      "Jeffrey Sprecher, CEO of Intercontinental Exchange, which owns the NYSE, helped organize the dinner, according to the sources. Lynn Martin, the president of the NYSE, will also be attending.",
      "Others who plan to attend the 7:30 p.m. dinner include Citadel founder Ken Griffin, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts co-founder Henry Kravis, Apollo Global Management's Marc Rowan and SoftBank's Masayoshi Son, sources said. NYSE President Lynn Martin will also be in attendance.",
      "Many of those attending have been longtime donors to Mr. Trump, and some, like Son, have announced their companies would make significant investments in the U.S.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick are on the guest list, too.",
      "Bankers have been pitching the administration on handling the IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which will be a major event on Wall Street. Mr. Trump announced in May that he wanted to take the two mortgage giants public, noting at the time that the two had returned to profitability after the government took them over during the 2008 financial crisis. The two entities buy mortgages from lenders and hold them in their portfolios or package them into mortgage-backed securities to be sold.",
      "Fannie and Freddie are not the focus of the dinner, sources said. Instead, Mr. Trump and top administration officials want to discuss affordability, an issue that Americans said was their top concern in the elections last week, where Democrats swept the major races. By Wednesday afternoon, however, the focus of the meeting was still unclear to some attendees, a banking industry source said Wednesday.",
      "In September, the president hosted more than a dozen tech industry tycoons at the White House, including the CEOs of Apple, Google, Microsoft and Meta. And he's held one-on-one events in the Oval Office with a succession of tech and pharmaceutical executives, often to announce multibillion-dollar manufacturing deals.",
      "Last month, JPMorgan Chase \u2014 the nation's largest bank in terms of deposits \u2014 announced it intends to invest $1.5 trillion over the next decade to support \"industries critical to national economic security and resiliency,\" including critical minerals, defense technology and artificial intelligence. That represents a 50% increase from the $1 trillion in investments it had planned, the company said.",
      "Mr. Trump often uses Wall Street as one barometer for his handling of the economy. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" that aired earlier this month, he touted a recent S&P 500 record.",
      "\"We're doing really well, and everybody knows it,\" he said.",
      "But some in the business community have chafed at the president's policies. Stocks plunged in April when Mr. Trump unveiled hefty tariffs on dozens of countries. Though markets have recovered since then, many economists worry the tariffs could lead to higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "His pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates could also clash with Wall Street's strong preference for an independent Fed, and Mr. Trump has faced pushback from the pro-business Chamber of Commerce over a plan to charge hefty fees for high-skilled worker visas.",
      "Mr. Trump's relationship with Dimon, who has helmed JPMorgan Chase since before the 2008 financial crisis, has gone through a couple of rough patches. In 2023, Mr. Trump called Dimon a \"Highly overrated Globalist,\" after he talked up Mr. Trump's GOP primary rival, Nikki Haley. But the following year, Mr. Trump told Bloomberg Businessweek he had \"a lot of respect for Jamie Dimon.\"",
      "Dimon cautioned in April that Mr. Trump's tariffs could slow economic growth, but told CNBC three months later that the tariffs had been \"greatly moderated.\" He also supported the tax provisions in the Trump-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Earlier this year, Dimon told \"60 Minutes\" he understood why Mr. Trump won in 2024, and believed people had \"legitimate concerns\" about issues like immigration. He said that \"people wanted kind of more pro-growth and pro-business policies, that they didn't want to be lectured to on social policies continuously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing federal regulators to combat alleged \"debanking\" of conservatives by financial institutions, that is, the refusal of banking services on the basis of \"political affiliations, religious beliefs or lawful business activities,\" according to the order.",

    "summary": "A report released by human rights groups found that the treatment of Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador's CECOT prison amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.",
    "story": [
      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",
      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not address the allegations in Wednesday's report, but said, \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.\"",
      "\"CBS should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country,\" Jackson added in a statement.",
      "The Venezuelan men at the center of the investigation were released from CECOT this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap. Most of them were deported to El Salvador in mid-March by the U.S. government after the Trump administration accused them of being dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua. Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",
      "The human rights groups made similar findings in their report, saying their \"review of criminal record background documents indicates that many of them had not been convicted of any crimes by federal or state authorities in the United States, nor in Venezuela or other Latin American countries where they had lived.\"",

      "Schlossberg, 32, is entering the Democratic primary to succeed retiring Rep. Jerrold Nadler and represent New York's 12th Congressional District. The seat represents the Upper East Side, Upper West Side and Midtown sections of Manhattan, an overwhelmingly Democratic area, and one of the nation's wealthiest and geographically smallest congressional districts.",
      "Schlossberg announced his campaign in a statement that warned \"America is in crisis\" and castigated President Trump for \"using his power to suspend civil rights, silence dissent, and send armed forces into our cities.\"",
      "\"We can do better,\" the statement read. \"The Democratic Party must win back the House of Representatives and elect a new generation of leaders.\"",
      "Schlossberg is the son of Caroline Kennedy, a former U.S. ambassador to Japan and Australia, and Edwin Schlossberg, an artist and designer who helped design the museums at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, among other projects.",
      "A graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School, he is perhaps best known in political circles for a social media presence that offers up unapologetic and at times crude criticism of Mr. Trump.",
      "Despite his name recognition, political pedigree and resemblance to his grandfather and late uncle, John F. Kennedy Jr., Schlossberg enters what could become a crowded primary.",
      "One candidate already in the race is Democratic Assemblyman Micah Lasher, a former aide to Nadler, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, as well as a political ally of New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani. Erik Bottcher, a New York City councilman from the district, is among those also reportedly considering a bid.",
      "Other well-known Democrats living in or near the district, including former head of the Federal Trade Commission Lina Khan and Chelsea Clinton, were encouraged to run, but declined to do so.",
      "Schlossberg campaigned on behalf of former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris last year and has frequently featured Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, on his social media accounts in recent months.",
      "He may score early attention and financing for his campaign, but he joins the fray at a time of generational and ideological upheaval in the Democratic Party nationally and in New York.",
      "Mamdani, a 34-year-old democratic socialist, is set to take over City Hall next year and the movement that elected him \u2014 including New York-area members of the Democratic Socialists of America \u2014 is pondering how to further engage in city and state politics. Lasher, 43, is seen as a next-generation star who's climbed the city's political ranks through more traditional means.",
      "Nodding to the anticipated fight ahead, Schlossberg's campaign logo puts an emphasis on the word \"New.\" And his announcement said his \"campaign is for the young at heart, the strong in spirit, and anyone who thinks we deserve better.\"",
      "If he wins, Schlossberg would be at least the seventh member of the extended Kennedy family to serve in Congress.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbs-news-analysis-the-voters-mamdani-added-to-the-democratic-coalition-in-new-york/",
    "published": "Tue, 11 Nov 2025 19:12:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani's mayoral campaign turned out lots of voters who didn't back Kamala Harris last year \u2014 they are ethnically diverse, younger and less affluent.",
    "story": [
      "One of the hallmarks of Zohran Mamdani's historic win in New York City was the big turnout that included lots of new voters. The city's expanded electorate saw far more young people cast votes than usual, as well as many voters who had not turned out in recent elections.",
      "As the Democratic Party discusses whether to focus on turning out its base or persuading those on the other side, CBS News dove deeper into the data on new Democratic voters in last week's election \u2014 specifically, people who didn't back them in 2024. This group differs demographically from voters who backed Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Mamdani's new voters are younger, more ethnically diverse, and less affluent \u2014 and they also voted in the off year for reasons distinct from those that drive consistent voters to the polls.",
      "How many voters did Mamdani bring into the fold?",
      "A closer look at the CBS News Voter Poll suggests that 15% of Mamdani's voters didn't back Harris last year, either because they preferred Donald Trump (5%), voted for a third-party candidate (3%) or just didn't vote for president (6%). Mayoral votes are still being counted, but that translates to about 60,000 Trump-to-Mamdani voters and another 70,000 Mamdani voters who sat out 2024.",
      "An even higher share of Mamdani-not-Harris voters were new mayoral voters. That is, half of them reported they had never voted in an election for mayor before.",
      "Queens stands out as the borough where the Mamdani campaign both flipped and activated the most voters. About one in 10 Mamdani voters backed Mr. Trump last year, and another 7% did not vote for president. Looking at the numbers another way, our polling suggests that 15% of Trump voters turning out in the mayoral election flipped to Mamdani.",
      "Demographic differences",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters look quite different from more consistent voters in a variety of ways:",
      "Mamdani benefited from strong youth support, but Mamdani-not-Harris voters are even younger than his other voters \u2014 two thirds of them were under the age of 45.Mamdani-not-Harris voters are less likely to have college degrees, and they tend to have lower family incomes (44% are under $50,000 annually).Mamdani-not-Harris voters are plurality Asian, while Harris-Mamdani voters are plurality White. And when it comes to religion, a 29% plurality of Mamdani-not-Harris voters are Muslim.",

      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters are plurality Asian, while Harris-Mamdani voters are plurality White. And when it comes to religion, a 29% plurality of Mamdani-not-Harris voters are Muslim.",
      "Attitudinal differences",
      "Along with being younger and more diverse, Mamdani-not-Harris voters look different in their general political views and how they came to decide their mayoral vote:",
      "Mamdani-not-Harris voters were much less likely to identify as Democrats \u2014 only half did \u2014 or as liberal on most political matters.While most disapprove of the job Mr. Trump is doing as president, the vast majority say he was not a factor in their vote for mayor. By contrast, most consistent Democratic voters say a reason for their vote was opposing Mr. Trump.Related to the socioeconomic differences we see, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are likelier to describe New York's economy in negative terms and somewhat likelier to say they are falling behind financially.Another difference that emerges is the salience of Israel as a voting issue: the majority of Mamdani-not-Harris voters said the candidates' positions on Israel were a major factor in their vote.And finally, Mamdani-not-Harris voters took longer to make up their mind about their choice for mayor. About four in 10 decided in the last month of the campaign. That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",

That is consistent with them being less partisan and ideologically committed than Mamdani's other supporters, the vast majority of whom decided on him before October.",
      "Jackson Heights is a good illustration of where Mamdani added plenty of these kinds of voters. This heavily Asian and Latino working-class neighborhood in Queens leans Democratic, but it's not as deeply blue as other pockets of the city. Harris carried it with 56% of the vote, but Mr. Trump still did better than expected last year.",
      "CBS News estimates suggest that Mamdani is on track to match Harris' support level here, despite the fact that many Democrats and Harris voters preferred Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's relative strength in the neighborhood therefore comes from flipping a non-trivial share of Trump voters, as well as a higher-than-expected turnout, featuring lots of 2024 non-voters and new mayoral voters.",
      "Further down the Northeast Corridor\u2026",
      "In summary, Mamdani-not-Harris voters are younger and more diverse, both ethnically and socioeconomically. And they appear to be less ideological and more focused on pocketbook issues than they are on Mr. Trump.",
      "While sizable and diverse, New York City's electorate obviously is not representative of voters nationwide. But the gubernatorial races further south in New Jersey and Virginia offer additional data points on the types of voters Democrats brought into the tent this year \u2014 and many of the same patterns emerge.",
      "Democrats Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia won in landslides, thanks both to high turnout in Democratic areas and some Trump voters flipping. And it was voters of color, specifically Latino voters, and younger voters who were the likeliest to flip. In New Jersey, for example, 18% of Latino Trump voters flipped to Sherrill this year, while only 5% of White Trump voters did so.",
      "Add to this group voters who backed this year's Democratic nominees but didn't turn out in 2024 and you see many of the same characteristics as we saw in New York: the Democrat-not-Harris voters tend to be younger, less partisan, less affluent, and more focused on the economy.",
      "These trends mirror CBS News polling that finds Mr. Trump's approval rating has declined the most with young people, people of color, and less politically engaged Americans. But despite mostly disapproving of the president, new Democratic voters across these states mostly said their vote was not about him. As Democrats chart a path forward, there is much to replicate from their electoral success last week. Whether their goal is persuading former GOP voters to cross over, or persuading those who are disengaged that turning out is worth it, a focus on bread-and-butter economic issues seems to be a winning recipe for ousting incumbents.",
      "This analysis relies on county- and precinct-level election results, demographic estimates, and survey data from the CBS News Voter Poll. The Voter Poll was conducted by SSRS, an independent research company, on behalf of CBS, ABC, CNN, Fox News, NBC, and the Associated Press. It combines data collected from verified registered voters online and by telephone, with in-person exit poll data collected on Election Day.",

      "In a letter to President Trump on Monday, also seen by CBS News, Judiciary Committee Democrats wrote that Maxwell \"is preparing a 'Commutation Application' for your Administration to review, undoubtedly coming to you for your direct consideration. The Warden herself is directly helping Ms. Maxwell copy, print, and send documents related to this application.\"",
      "The letter says the information received demonstrates \"either that Ms. Maxwell is herself requesting you release her from her 20-year prison sentence for her role as a co-conspirator in Jeffrey Epstein's international child sex trafficking ring, or that this child sex predator now holds such tremendous sway in the second Trump Administration that you and your DOJ will follow her clemency recommendations.\"",
      "The letter also alleges that Maxwell is receiving preferential and lenient treatment at the Bryan federal prison camp in Texas, where she was transferred over the summer after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss the Epstein case.",

      "The committee's letter says the panel has received information that the prison camp staff \"has heaped favorable concierge-style treatment on Ms. Maxwell,\" such as customized meals that are hand-delivered to her cell.",
      "When Maxwell wanted to arrange a private meeting with visitors, the letter says, \"the Warden personally arranged it for her \u2014 and then provided a special cordoned off area for visitors to arrive, as well as an assortment of snacks and refreshments for her guests.\" The letter also says Maxwell's visitors were allowed to bring computers, which it calls \"an unprecedented action by the Warden given the security risk and potential for Ms. Maxwell to use a computer to conduct unmonitored communications with the outside world.\"",
      "Maxwell's defense attorney did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "CBS News reported on Aug. 1 that Maxwell was transferred from a low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to the Bryan prison camp, a smaller minimum-security facility. No reason was given for the move. Her transfer came just days after Maxwell's highly unusual meeting with Blanche in Tallahassee, in which her attorney said she answered all of Blanche's questions.",
      "In their letter, Democrats call for Blanche to be made available for a public hearing to answer questions from the committee about the use of law enforcement resources and any \"potential exchange of favors.\"",

      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:33:14 -0500",
    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",
      "Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights\u00a0being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",

      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",

      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",

    "summary": "A government funding package signed by President Trump on Wednesday will reopen federal agencies, opening the door for food-stamp recipients to collect their full benefits.",
    "story": [
      "After weeks of uncertainty, millions of Americans will soon start receiving federal nutrition assistance benefits again, after President Trump on Wednesday night signed a bill passed by Congress to end the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "The legislation, which the Senate approved on Monday, will restore Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits for November. It also calls for state governments to be reimbursed for any funds they spent to run programs usually paid for by the federal government.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last month that it would not fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, for November if the shutdown continued. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits to help pay for groceries.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to extend a pause of a federal judge's ruling that ordered the Trump administration to fully fund SNAP benefits in November. Adding to the confusion for food-stamp recipients, some states have since issued full benefits for November, while others have sent only partial or no payments.",
      "A USDA spokesperson told CBS News that SNAP recipients in most states will get their benefits \"within 24 hours\" after the government shutdown ends. The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News they expect the flow of benefits to start relatively quickly once the shutdown ends, but noted that the exact timeline could differ by state.",
      "Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director at the Food Research & Action Center (FRAC), a nonprofit group focused on ending hunger, said states that have already attempted to issue the full November payment should be able to move fast, while others may need a few days to deal with administrative issues.",
      "\"States that did not issue full benefits earlier will need to resubmit their files to their EBT vendors for processing, which may take a few additional days,\" she said.",
      "Crystal FitzSimons, president of FRAC, recommended that food-stamp participants check their state family and social services websites for updates on when payments will go out.",
      "SNAP timing differs by state",
      "At least 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, according to The Associated Press. That funding was distributed in the short window between a Nov. 6 court ruling that required the federal government to make full SNAP payments and a ruling the following day by the Supreme Court that blocked the lower court's order.",
      "In addition, 16 states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits, the AP reported.",
      "Although federal agencies could soon be set to reopen, experts said the interruption in nutrition aid has already hurt many Americans who lean on SNAP to put food on the table.",
      "\"You can't eat retroactively when your SNAP was delayed,\" Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, told CBS News. \"Getting your [delayed] benefits is better than never getting them at all, but it doesn't help the harm that you experienced in the past.\"",

    "summary": "After 43 days and more than a dozen attempts to reopen the government, President Trump signed the funding package, passed by the Senate and House, into law.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The longest government shutdown in history came to an end on Wednesday after weeks of gridlock causing air travel disruptions, denying access to food benefits to millions and forcing thousands of federal workers to go without paychecks.",
      "After 43 days and more than a dozen attempts to reopen the government, President Trump signed the funding package, passed by the Senate and House, into law late Wednesday, meaning the funding lapse is officially over.",
      "Here's how the shutdown started, and eventually came to an end:",
      "A Senate standoff",
      "The standoff began in late September as lawmakers faced a deadline to fund the government by the start of a new fiscal year on Oct. 1. House Republicans passed a short-term funding measure on Sept. 19 to keep the government funded at existing levels until Nov. 21. But with Democratic support needed to move forward with any funding measure in the Senate, the chamber was at an impasse.",
      "The top Democrats in Congress had been pushing since August to meet with GOP leaders and the White House on the funding issue, ramping up their calls to address expiring health care tax credits as the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline drew near.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats set out to center health care issues in the funding fight \u2014 setting their sights on the expiring health insurance tax credits as their key demand. The credits, under the Affordable Care Act, help millions of Americans pay for health insurance premiums for plans purchased on state exchanges. Their expiration would mean eye-popping increases in insurance costs for those with ACA plans.",
      "Months earlier, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer faced intense pushback for voting to advance a GOP measure during the last funding fight, increasing the pressure on him to dig in this time around.",
      "Democrats sought to negotiate, introducing a counter-proposal to the House-passed measure to fund the government that included their health care demands. But Republicans remained steadfast in their belief that health care and other issues should be negotiated outside the context of funding the government, and urged Democrats to agree to a \"clean\" temporary funding extension.",
      "Over the course of seven weeks, Republicans and Democrats traded blame for the funding impasse. Senate Republicans put forward the House-passed funding measure for a vote 14 times, seeking to peel off support from Democrats as the caucus remained largely united in their opposition. But throughout it all, member-level bipartisan conversations seeking an offramp were bubbling under the surface.",
      "As the weeks dragged on, the real-world effects of the shutdown began to take their toll, raising the stakes for the continuing stalemate and pushing Democrats to make a deal. Millions of federal workers began missing paychecks, straining those with little savings or no access to credit. Chaos began to emerge at airports after the Trump administration said it would reduce flight traffic amid staffing shortages caused by strained air traffic controllers. And millions of Americans were at risk of losing access to food aid under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.",
      "A bipartisan undercurrent",
      "As early as the first days of the shutdown, a small group of moderate senators began signaling tepid interest in finding a way out at the member level, while leaders refused to engage.",
      "What began as a large bipartisan huddle on the Senate floor would go on to involve a number of senators from across both the Democratic caucus and Republican conference.",
      "The conversations across the aisle ramped up as the shutdown neared the longest on record. Sen. Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican and appropriator, told reporters on Oct. 30 she had spoken with Schumer to \"lay the foundation\" on continued appropriations work. And although Schumer didn't vote for the final deal to end the shutdown, the long-term funding efforts became a key to unlocking an eventual agreement by demonstrating Republicans' willingness to work on the appropriations process on a bipartisan basis.",
      "The contours of the eventual deal began to emerge during the first week of November, with senators discussing an agreement that would fund the government alongside a trio of long-term appropriations bills. In exchange for their support, Democrats would be promised a vote on extending health insurance tax credits that they had demanded.",
      "Britt told reporters on Nov. 4 that she made calls through the prior weekend on the funding package, saying she was hopeful it could be part of what ends the stalemate. Sen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican involved in the talks, said on the same day that the appropriations package might entice Democrats to \"vote for something other than just simply a continuing resolution\" while providing \"a path forward\" beyond a vote on the health care tax credits. And Democrats involved in the talks generally remained tight-lipped, signaling that things were close.",
      "But the impasse would stretch on for a few more days, after Democrats swept key races in off-year elections. The victories emboldened the holdouts, who argued that voters had given them marching orders not to cave on their health care demands.",
      "Meanwhile, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear that he would not commit to a vote on the health insurance tax credits in the lower chamber. That comment underlined concerns from some Democrats that a future Senate vote on health care, which they were set to receive as part of a deal to reopen the government, would go nowhere.",
      "Still, the shutdown's toll on Americans continued to ratchet up pressure on senators to reach a resolution.",
      "On Nov. 7, Senate Democrats presented an offer to Republicans, saying they would end the government shutdown in exchange for a one-year extension of the health care tax credits and a plan to continue broader talks. But the proposal was swiftly rejected by Republicans as a \"nonstarter,\" as Senate Majority Leader John Thune maintained the position that negotiations on health care could only come after the government reopened.",
      "The long-sought breakthrough",
      "On Nov. 9, the deal to end the shutdown finally came together, with a group of eight Democrats agreeing to advance a funding measure as part of a broader agreement to end the shutdown.",
      "Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck with Thune and the White House secured a vote in December on the Affordable Care Act tax credits. The deal attached the trio of full-year funding bills, while restoring food aid at higher levels, and paving the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills. And it reversed all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown, while preventing them for a limited time going forward.",
      "The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused Schumer's offer \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure, arguing that continuing the shutdown would only inflict more pain without any hopes of a better deal.",
      "The final turn seemed to come with the provision in the bill that would address the Trump administration's layoffs. Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the eight Democrats to back the funding deal, had long called the issue his principal priority in the shutdown fight. And he said he joined the group of Democrats just 48 hours before the deal was announced.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told reporters that the language in the new continuing resolution reversing the layoffs came from the White House. Mullin said the White House told Republicans they were willing to revert the layoffs if it could help win Kaine over.",
      "\"It was the right provision which brought him over, which brought a couple other people over, too,\" Mullin said. \"That's what got it over the finish line.\"",
      "With coordination with the House and White House, the deal was on a glidepath to passage in the lower chamber, and to swiftly secure the president's signature.",
      "The House passed the bill late Wednesday, and Mr. Trump signed it during an Oval Office ceremony hours later. He applauded congressional Republicans and the Democratic senators who voted for the deal, while lashing out at most other Democrats.",
      "\"We're sending a clear message that we will never give in to extortion,\" he said.",

      "The Department of Transportation on Wednesday night announced that 6% of scheduled flights at\u00a040 of the nation's busiest airports\u00a0will remain canceled on Thursday, rolling back the initial plan to increase cancellations to 8% on Thursday.",
      "Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said there has been a decline in air traffic controller callouts since the weekend. He said it's a good sign that airlines may soon be able to resume normal operations.",
      "\"The FAA safety team is encouraged to see our air traffic control staffing surge, and they feel comfortable with pausing the reduction schedule to give us time to review the airspace,\" Duffy said in a statement. \"The data is going to guide what we do because the safety of the American people comes first.\"",
      "More than 900 U.S. flights had been canceled as of 8 p.m. ET on Wednesday, according to data from the tracking site FlightAware. Another 2,203 flights were delayed, though not all of those delays were due to staffing.",
      "Tuesday had\u00a0fewer flight delays and cancellations\u00a0than previous days. Air traffic control towers reported minimal staffing shortages with only 11 staffing triggers, or times when the air traffic controller levels fell below planned minimums, compared to the 81 that occurred on Saturday. On Wednesday, there were four staffing triggers.",
      "But even once the government reopens, reversing the flight cuts will not be immediate, Duffy said on Tuesday. The process may happen gradually, as the cuts themselves were phased in, he said. Duffy said he and FAA safety officials would look at relevant data, including pilot complaints, incidents where planes fly too close together, and runway incursions before reversing any of the cuts.",

But the Senate's filibuster rule effectively requires nearly all legislation \u2014 including the House's continuing resolution to temporarily fund the government \u2014 to reach a 60-vote threshold first. A single senator may delay a bill during debate by invoking a filibuster, which can only be ended if a supermajority of 60 senators votes to end debate.",

      "$130 million: The private donation Trump says he's used to help pay the military",
      "President Trump says an unnamed \"patriot\" donated $130 million to fund troops' paychecks, which are normally cut off during shutdowns. The New York Times reported that the donor is Timothy Mellon, a reclusive billionaire and scion to the Mellon family banking fortune.",
      "That nine-figure check likely isn't enough to cover the military's entire payroll. There are around 1.3 million active-duty service members, so the donation comes out to roughly $100 per person.",
      "At least $7 billion: The economic cost of the shutdown",
      "The shutdown could temporarily cut the nation's economic output by billions of dollars as unpaid federal workers curtail their spending and SNAP benefits are paused, leading to a 1-percentage-point GDP drop if the shutdown lasts four weeks and a 2-point dip if it drags on for eight weeks, the Congressional Budget Office said in an Oct. 29 estimate.",
      "Much of that decline will be reversed after the government reopens and the spigot of federal spending turns back on \u2014 but not all of it. The GDP will face a sustained drop of $7 billion after a four-week shutdown, $11 billion after six weeks and $14 billion after eight weeks, the CBO says.",

      "Washington \u2014 The House returns Wednesday for the first time since the start of the government shutdown and nearly two months after it last voted, bringing an end to the chamber's longest absence in recent memory.",
      "The House has been out of session since Sept. 19, when it passed a Republican measure to fund the government until Nov. 21. But the funding bill stalled in the Senate, where it needed Democratic support for passage. A breakthrough in the seven-week stalemate came this week when several Democratic senators cut a deal with Republicans to end the shutdown.",
      "The Senate amended the House-passed bill to include three full-year appropriations bills, while extending the remainder of government funding until Jan. 30.",
      "In exchange for their votes, Senate Republicans promised Democrats they would have a vote on tax credits that expire at the end of the year and help millions of Americans afford health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Most Democrats opposed the deal, but the party now appears to be shifting focus to the upcoming fight over health care.",

      "Arguing that the House had done its job after the mid-September vote, Johnson canceled weeks of votes and committee hearings were put on hold.",
      "\"We have a lot of business to do,\" Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said Monday. \"There'll be long days and long nights here for the foreseeable future to make up for all this lost time that was imposed upon us.\"",
      "Johnson's decision to cancel weeks in session fueled backlash from House Democrats, who have repeatedly called on the GOP leader to swear in Rep.-elect Adelita Grijalva, a Democrat who was elected to her late father's seat in Arizona on Sept. 23.",
      "Democrats, and some Republicans, saw Johnson's resistance to immediately swearing her in as an attempt to delay a vote on releasing files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Grijalva will be the final signature on a discharge petition, spearheaded by Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California, that will force a vote on the issue and could embarrass President Trump.",
      "Johnson also faced criticism from some Republicans over the House's lengthy absence.",
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, one of Johnson's top GOP critics over the decision to keep members away from Washington, told \"The Megyn Kelly Show\" this week that Republicans' House majority \"is being ruined\" by \"inaction.\" Noting the September vote, Greene said the House hasn't \"been to work since.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Kevin Kiley of California, who stayed in Washington over the shutdown, had argued that the shutdown could have ended sooner \"if we actually had the House of Representatives in town.\"",
      "In order to end the shutdown, Johnson will have to keep his often-divided conference together, which could prove easier with President Trump's backing of the Senate deal. The chamber is set to vote on the final version of the legislation on Wednesday.",
      "House Republicans can afford to lose only two votes if all members are present and voting. Two Republicans voted against the original version of the bill when it cleared the House on Sept. 19, though it also had the support of one Democrat.",
      "But lawmakers could face travel disruptions on their way back with thousands of flight delays and cancellations around the U.S. as the Federal Aviation Administration limits flights due to staffing issues caused by the shutdown. Johnson urged House members ahead of final passage in the Senate to begin traveling to Washington \"right now.\"",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday he expects all members of his party will make it back in time for the vote.",
      "\"I expect that everyone's going to be back, and we'll be at full strength,\" Jeffries, who could face defections of his own during the vote, told reporters.",
      "The House will also have to confront the expiring health care subsidies in the coming weeks. Johnson has not committed to holding a vote on the issue if an extension makes it out of the Senate. Millions of Americans will see their insurance premiums skyrocket next year without an extension or other fix.",

    "summary": "The three emails appear to be exchanges between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as the author Michael Wolff and Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday released emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and others about President Trump.",
      "Among the documents is a 2011 message from Epstein to Ghislaine Maxwell, his longtime associate, that said Mr. Trump \"spent hours at my house\" with one of Epstein's victims, whose name is redacted. In another email in 2019 to author Michael Wolff, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\"",
      "Maxwell\u00a0was convicted of conspiring in Epstein's sex trafficking ring and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Wolff has written several books about Mr. Trump.",
      "House Democrats said the emails were turned over by Epstein's estate, which they said released more than 23,000 documents that lawmakers are now reviewing. The full Oversight Committee also released more than 20,000 pages of records from Epstein's estate Wednesday and claimed Democrats \"cherry-pick\" from the material \"to generate clickbait.\" The latest batch includes emails, records from court proceedings, transcripts from depositions, press clippings and other material.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously said he cut ties with Epstein years ago, and he has not been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt accused Democrats of selectively leaking emails to \"create a fake narrative\" to harm Mr. Trump. She said the unnamed victim in the emails is the late Virginia Giuffre, who met Epstein in the summer of 2000, just before she turned 17,\u00a0while working at the spa\u00a0at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre, who died by suicide in April,\u00a0had not accused the president of any wrongdoing. She said in her memoir that Mr. Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" when she met him in his office.",
      "\"The fact remains that President Trump kicked Jeffrey Epstein out of his club decades ago for being a creep to his female employees, including Giuffre,\" Leavitt said in a statement. \"These stories are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to distract from President Trump's historic accomplishments, and any American with common sense sees right through this hoax and clear distraction from the government opening back up again.\"",
      "CBS has not independently verified the emails.",
      "In one of the messages from Epstein to Maxwell, dated April 2, 2011, the late financier wrote, \"i want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is Trump. [Victim 1] spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "Maxwell then replies, \"I have been thinking about that\u2026\"",
      "In a second email that appears to be from Epstein to Wolff, dated Jan. 31, 2019, Epstein references a victim, whose name is redacted, and mentions Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida resort.",
      "\"Trump said he asked me to resign, never a member ever. of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" the message from Epstein reads.",
      "In the third exchange released by House Democrats, which appears to be between Epstein and Wolff, Wolff writes on Dec. 15, 2015, \"I hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you\u2013either on air or in scrum afterwards.\"",
      "According to the email exchange, Epstein then replies, \"if we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\" Wolff responds, \"I think you should let him hang himself. If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives you a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive benefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is possible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political correctness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his first run for the White House in June 2015 and would have been on the campaign trail when the emails between Wolff and Epstein were exchanged.",
      "Wolff authored a book about the first few months of Mr. Trump's first term in office, titled \"Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\" that was released in 2018.",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein were friends for years and ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004, more than a decade before Epstein was indicted on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019. Epstein had separately reached a deal with federal prosecutors in Florida in 2007, in which he agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month prison sentence.",
      "Epstein\u00a0died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",
      "The new release comes amid a push for more transparency on the Epstein files in Congress. The House is set to return Wednesday for the first time since Sept. 19. The lower chamber has been away from Washington while the Senate worked through an impasse on reopening the government. The House's absence meant the newest member, Democrat Adelita Grijalva, was not sworn in, preventing her from becoming the final signature needed on a discharge petition to circumvent House GOP leaders and force a vote on a measure to compel the Justice Department to release all of the files from its investigation into Epstein. Grijalva is expected to sign the petition after she's sworn in on Wednesday, starting the clock on the process to move forward with the bill. A vote likely wouldn't come until next month.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0claimed\u00a0on social media Wednesday that the \"Democrats are trying to bring up the Jeffrey Epstein Hoax again because they'll do anything at all to deflect on how badly they've done on the Shutdown, and so many other subjects. Only a very bad, or stupid, Republican would fall into that trap.\"",
      "\"There should be no deflections to Epstein or anything else, and any Republicans involved should be focused only on opening up our Country, and fixing the massive damage caused by the Democrats!\" the president wrote.",
      "Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, urged the Justice Department in a statement Wednesday to make the Epstein files public \"immediately,\" pledging that the panel \"will continue pushing for answers and will not stop until we get justice for the victims.\"",
      "\"The more Donald Trump tries to cover up the Epstein files, the more we uncover,\" Garcia said. \"These latest emails and correspondence raise glaring questions about what else the White House is hiding and the nature of the relationship between Epstein and the President.\"",
      "Several tranches of records have been turned over to congressional investigators, including from Epstein's estate. The House Oversight Committee has also sought information from a slew of former attorneys general and FBI directors, as well as former President Bill Clinton.",
      "Lawmakers have also questioned Alex Acosta, who was the U.S. attorney in South Florida when prosecutors investigated Epstein in the 2000s and reached the nonprosecution agreement with him.",
      "Acosta went on to serve as Labor secretary during Mr. Trump's first term but resigned in 2019 amid questions about his handling of Epstein's case.",

      "Washington \u2014 An effort to force a House vote on compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein secured the final signature it needed Wednesday after House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed the swearing-in of a newly elected Democrat for seven weeks.",
      "The effort, known as a discharge petition, defies House GOP leaders, who have opposed putting legislation backed by Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky on the floor. Khanna and Massie introduced the measure, titled the Epstein Files Transparency Act, in July as pressure intensified on the Trump administration to release more Epstein-related files.",
      "Their bill, as well as several other endeavors to release the materials, led to the disruption of several committee meetings and stalled floor action on other legislation before the House began its August recess days early.",
      "Massie vowed to keep the Epstein issue a priority and filed a discharge petition upon their return in early September. A discharge petition enables members of the lower chamber to bypass House leadership if they can get a majority of members \u2014 218 \u2014 to sign on.",
      "All House Democrats and four Republicans have added their names. Besides Massie, GOP Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Lauren Boebert of Colorado have signed on. Two special elections in Virginia and Arizona in September provided the final two signatures from Democrats to reach the 218 threshold.",
      "Rep. Adelita Grijalva, who was elected on Sept. 23 to fill the seat of her late father Raul, added her name to the petition on Wednesday, shortly after she was sworn in. She pointed to Epstein survivors in the House gallery who she said were present for her swearing-in.",
      "\"Just this morning, House Democrats released more emails showing that Trump knew more about Epstein's abuses than he previously acknowledged,\" Grijalva said. \"It's past time for Congress to restore its role as a check and balance on this administration and fight for we, the American people.\"",
      "The House has been on break since Sept. 19, when it voted to pass a Republican bill to avert the government shutdown. The House was scheduled to be back in late September, but GOP leaders had extended the break until this week to increase pressure on the Senate to pass a short-term funding measure.",
      "Supporters of the discharge petition interpreted the break as a move to avoid swearing in Grijalva, who had said she would add her name to the petition. Her signature on Wednesday starts the clock on a waiting period of seven legislative days before a member can motion to bring it to the floor. After that, leadership has two legislative days to schedule a vote, putting the timeline for a vote as soon as early December.",
      "But Johnson said Wednesday night he would bypass the seven-day waiting period and put it on the floor next week.",
      "\"We're going to put that on the floor for a full vote next week, as soon as we get back,\" he told reporters.",
      "It's unclear if the Senate would take it up if it clears the House.",
      "\"I believe we're going to get 40, 50 Republicans voting with us on the release,\" Khanna told reporters Wednesday. \"And if we get that kind of overwhelming vote, that's going to push the Senate and it's going to push for a release of the files from the Justice Department.\"",
      "In September, Massie said GOP leaders were in \"full panic\" over the discharge petition and had \"actually threatened\" some of the cosigners \u2014 \"politically, not physically.\"",
      "The bipartisan legislation calls for the release of documents relating to all investigations into Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of sex trafficking. The bill would compel the release of flight logs, travel records, names of individuals and entities referenced in any Epstein case and internal Justice Department communications within 30 days. It would also make public any records \"concerning the destruction, deletion, alteration, misplacement, or concealment of documents, recordings, or electronic data\" related to Epstein and his associates, as well as documentation about his death.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has opposed the legislation, arguing that it does not go far enough to protect victims. He has criticized the discharge petition as \"unnecessary,\" citing the House Oversight Committee's investigation into the Epstein case.",
      "During its investigation, the Oversight Committee has released tens of thousands of Epstein-related records, including a new trove of documents unveiled on Wednesday.",
      "Hours before Grijalva added her signature to the petition, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released emails exchanged between Epstein and others about President Trump.",

    "summary": "Aviation experts said it could take several weeks for airline operations to resume normal service after federal agencies reopen.",
    "story": [
      "Commercial air travel around the U.S. isn't expected to return to normal\u00a0immediately after the U.S. government reopens, according to aviation experts.",
      "The government shutdown has snarled airport operations across the country, leading to flight delays and cancellations. While a vote to reopen the government would come as a relief to consumers, as well as to air traffic controllers and other Transportation Department personnel tasked with working without pay during the impasse, the system will take some time to recover.",
      "\"My guess is it's going to take a couple weeks,\" aviation security expert Sheldon Jacobson, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told CBS News. \"They have to get people back in places, airplanes back in places. This is non-trivial.\"",
      "He likened the process of ramping operations back up to turning a dial, rather than \"flicking a switch,\" noting that some airlines may have sent planes for maintenance as the Federal Aviation Administration throttled air traffic\u00a0at major airports last week because of the shutdown.",
      "\"They didn't furlough crew and put equipment away, but they might have put it in heavy maintenance,\" Jacobson said.",
      "Robert Poole, director of transportation policy at the Reason Foundation, a group promoting libertarian principles, said the flying public should expect it \"to take many weeks\" for air travel to return to normal.",
      "\"It definitely won't happen immediately,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The FAA slowed flight traffic to maintain safety standards after more air traffic controllers than usual called out sick as they worked without pay during the lapse in funding. The U.S. has long faced a shortage of air traffic controllers, a deficit exacerbated by the shutdown.",
      "\"We had a serious shortage of controllers before the shutdown. We have a worse shortage after, because the rate of controller retirements has increased during the shutdown,\" Poole said.",
      "Resuming paychecks for federal workers will incentivize air traffic controllers who called out sick to return to their jobs, according to experts. But back pay that workers are entitled to once the shutdown concludes might not arrive immediately, slowing how quickly operations can rebound.",
      "\"At the very least, it's likely that air traffic controllers will need to see back pay in their bank accounts before the higher-than-usual callout rates end,\" Julian Kheel, founder of Points Path, a flight search engine, told CBS News.",
      "In the near term, passengers looking ahead to upcoming trips should prepare to face continued disruptions, he added.",
      "\"The U.S. aviation system runs on precise coordination, and once that rhythm is broken, it won't bounce back overnight,\" Kheel said. \"From a passenger perspective, the first few days after the shutdown ends will likely see longer lines, reduced staffing and ongoing delays as the system recalibrates to full capacity.\"",

      "\"Under this system, employees live under constant threat of punishment if they get sick or injured or need time off to care for a family member,\" the filing claims, adding that the company's policies discourage employees from exercising their legal rights.",
      "The lawsuit alleges Amazon's practices violate the Americans with Disabilities Act and two other New York state laws governing disability discrimination and workplace absence policies.",
      "\"It's basically putting workers in the position of needing to choose between their safety and their paycheck,\" said Inimai Chettiar, the president of the nonprofit legal advocacy organization A Better Balance, which helped file the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed response to CBS News, Amazon denied the allegations.",
      "\"Claims that we don't follow federal and state laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act and New York State Human Rights Law (NYSHRL) are simply not true,\" the company said. \"Ensuring the health and well-being of our employees is our top priority, and we're committed to providing a safe and supportive environment for everyone.\"",
      "Amazon added, \"Our dedicated Accommodations team reviews each request individually to make sure employees have access to the accommodations and adjustments they need, and we continuously evaluate our approach to best address their needs.\"",
      "The lawsuit was filed in a federal court in New York by a woman named Cayla Lyster, who started working as an Amazon employee in 2022 in upstate New York. Lyster, who has a permanent genetic connective-tissue disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, said in the lawsuit that she requested certain accommodations from Amazon in 2023, including a chair to sit on, which Amazon allegedly delayed.",

      "The lawsuit comes after a five-year investigation by A Better Balance, which claims it documented hundreds of abuses against pregnant and disabled Amazon workers who requested time off.",

      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "summary": "A report released by human rights groups found that the treatment of Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador's CECOT prison amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance.",
    "story": [
      "A report released Wednesday by human rights groups determined that the deportation and treatment of more than 200 Venezuelan migrants imprisoned in El Salvador for months at the request of the U.S. amounted to arbitrary detention and enforced disappearance under international law.",
      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",
      "\"The human rights violations documented in this report violate El Salvador's obligations under international law, including the prohibitions on arbitrary detention, enforced disappearance, and torture and other ill-treatment,\" the report said.",
      "Citing dozens of interviews, including with 40 of the Venezuelan men held at the mega prison, Human Rights Watch and Cristosal said the detainees also faced \"inhumane\" conditions, incommunicado detention, inadequate access to food, limited medical care and the denial of basic hygiene, inconsistent with United Nations rules governing the treatment of prisoners.",
      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not address the allegations in Wednesday's report, but said, \"President Trump is committed to keeping his promises to the American people by removing dangerous criminal and terrorist illegal aliens who pose a threat to the American public.\"",
      "\"CBS should spend their time and energy amplifying the stories of Angel Parents, whose innocent American children have tragically been murdered by vicious illegal aliens that President Trump is removing from the country,\" Jackson added in a statement.",
      "The Venezuelan men at the center of the investigation were released from CECOT this summer and returned to Venezuela as part of a U.S.-brokered prisoner swap. Most of them were deported to El Salvador in mid-March by the U.S. government after the Trump administration accused them of being dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua. Many were deported from the U.S. with little to no due process under the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "CBS News was first to obtain and publish the list of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT in March. Using that list, \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News found that many of the deportees did not have any apparent criminal record, in the U.S. or abroad, despite the administration's allegations.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-death-row-executions-2025-rise/",
    "published": "Wed, 12 Nov 2025 11:38:00 -0500",
    "summary": "This year is expected to see capital punishment carried out more often than any other year since 2009. Experts weigh in on the increase.",
    "story": [
      "Executions are on the rise in the United States. After creeping upward since the coronavirus pandemic, when the country's use of the death penalty reached a historic low, the numbers have skyrocketed this year.",
      "Forty-one executions have been carried out so far in 2025, and, without intervention from government officials or the courts, another six will take place before January. Three are scheduled for this week: one each in Florida and\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0on Thursday, and another in\u00a0South Carolina on Friday.",
      "Identifying a previous year in which the prevalence of executions in the U.S. rivaled the current one requires looking back at least decade. Whether or not the remaining six proceed as planned, the death penalty has already had its busiest year since 2012, when 43 people were executed. The last time 47 executions took place over a single 12-month period was 2009.",
      "Criminal justice experts say the factors driving this year's increase are multifaceted, although they cite partisan pressure and the ripple effects of expired moratoriums as key contributors. There also is a lack of evidence suggesting citizen support for capital punishment has anything to do with it.",
      "\"A political effort\"",
      "Robin Maher, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, attributes the growing sum of executions to \"largely, a political effort.\" Her nonprofit organization is recognized among the nation's leading sources of data and analyses on how capital punishment is applied, but it doesn't take a position on the issue.",
      "\"The number of executions is certainly garnering some headlines right now because it does represent an increase from where we were in years' past, but there's absolutely no evidence it represents a change in public support for the death penalty by Americans,\" Maher said.",
      "Polling data suggests cultural attitudes nationwide have shifted away from backing the death penalty over the last half-century, with the October results of a Gallup survey showing just 52% of respondents favored the practice. Those results followed a steady decline in Americans' support for capital punishment since the early 1990s, according to Gallup's earlier polls, and they also marked a slight drop in support from 2024.",
      "At the same time, both the Bureau of Justice Statistics and the Death Penalty Information Center have tracked a dramatic decrease in new death sentences imposed by American juries since an annual peak in 1996, when 316 death sentences were imposed. Three years later, the U.S. executed 98 people, a record high in the modern history of the death penalty.",
      "Juries have sentence far fewer people to death each year \u2014 as of August, only 10 people have received death sentences in 2025,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Death Penalty Information Center \u2014 and the execution rate has generally mirrored that decline since the late 90s. After hitting a trough during the pandemic, executions did start taking place more often year to year, with 11 in 2021, 18 in 2022, 24 in 2023, and 25 in 2024.",
      "Capital punishment under Trump",
      "President Trump issued an executive order upon retaking office that encouraged attorneys general and district attorneys in states across the country to pursue the death penalty more aggressively, especially if an undocumented person is charged with a capital offense or a law enforcement officer has been killed.",
      "The order described capital punishment as \"an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes,\" and claimed its application \"continues to enjoy broad popular support.\" A number of studies have refuted or at least cast doubt on the theory that the threat of capital punishment meaningfully deters violence. Others have found the overall body of research on the topic to be inconclusive either way.",
      "Mr. Trump's order also said politicians and judges who oppose capital punishment \"have defied and subverted the laws of our country,\" using former President Joe Biden's decision to commute the sentences of most inmates on federal death row as an example of actions that the administration \"will not tolerate.\"",
      "The executive order came amid a broader backdrop of advocacy for the use of capital punishment under the Trump administration. After ending a 17-year hiatus on federal executions during the last six months of his first term, when he oversaw 13 of them, Mr. Trump more recently pledged to refill federal death row and seek the death penalty for murder cases\u00a0in Washington, D.C. Pam Bondi, his attorney general, has also prioritized reviving the federal death penalty.",
      "\"This administration has talked a lot about the death penalty and has not made any secret about their enthusiasm over the death penalty,\" Maher said. \"So, for some officials, that environment has made it easier for them to schedule executions to curry favor with this administration.\"",
      "Executions this year have taken place in 11 states: Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. All but Arizona are led by Republican governors.",
      "Florida has carried out 15 executions in 2025 \u2014 the largest share of any state \u2014 with three still to go. Alabama and Texas have carried out the second-highest number, with five executions each, a threshold that South Carolina is also expected to reach on Friday. Other than South Carolina, which had its first execution in 13 years in September 2024, those states are typically responsible for most executions that take place in the U.S. annually, but Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been signing death warrants at an unprecedented pace since January.",
      "\"Many of these states that are actively executing people are states that have governors who are politically aligned with the president on this,\" said John Blume, director of the Death Penalty Project at Cornell University, referencing DeSantis, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. \"They're very conservative and believe in this, and their attorneys general are too. They believe that in those jurisdictions that, you know, it's politically expedient for them to appear to be tough on the death penalty.\"",
      "Backlogs on death row",
      "Political pressures aren't the only forces motivating the increase. Multiple states that have executed inmates this year or plan to do so by the year's end recently resumed executions after lengthy hiatuses, some of which were legally binding.",
      "States like Arizona have restarted executions after being ordered to pause them for various stretches of time, while authorities reviewed capital punishment protocols that had drawn criticism and, in several cases, accusations of unconstitutional cruelty. Over the last decade or so, many correctional departments struggled to obtain viable drugs for lethal injections and came under intense public scrutiny as horror stories emerged of repeatedly botched procedures.",
      "As moratoriums lifted in one jurisdiction after another, states started \"clearing out the backlog\" of death row inmates who could not be executed while they were in place, Blume said. Some had new or renewed ways to do it: Alabama and Louisiana have now authorized the use of nitrogen gas to execute inmates, while South Carolina reintroduced firing squads and in March carried out the nation's first execution by that method in 15 years. If Friday's execution proceeds, South Carolina will have used a firing squad to put to death three of five inmates this year.",
      "Lethal injection remains the most common method for putting inmates to death. That could be partly due to Mr. Trump's executive order, which included a promise to supply \"a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection\" to each state that allows executions.",
      "\"The death penalty is the only proper punishment for some of the vilest crimes,\" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, in a statement to CBS News that also contained some of the language from Mr. Trump's executive order. \"President Trump knows this, that's why he signed an Executive Order on day one of his second term to restore the death penalty and protect public safety.\"",

Meyer's 98-year-old mother Joan, the paper's co-owner, died of a heart attack the next day, something he blames on the stress of the raid. Meyer had been \"stressed beyond her limits and overwhelmed by hours of shock and grief,\" the newspaper said at the time.",
      "During the raid, authorities seized cellphones and computers from the newsroom and rifled through reporters' desks. Search warrants linked the raid to a dispute between a local restaurant owner and the newspaper, which had obtained a copy of her driving record while reporting on her request for a city liquor license. The raid also came after the newspaper had dug into the background of the police chief at the time who led the raid.",
      "The raid triggered a national debate about press freedom focused on Marion, a town of about 1,900 people set among rolling prairie hills some 150 miles southwest of Kansas City, Missouri.\u00a0Police body camera footage\u00a0from Meyer's home showed his mother, who lived with him, visibly upset and telling officers, \"Get out of my house!\"",
      "An attorney for the newspaper, Bernie Rhodes, released a copy Tuesday of the five-page agreement resolving legal claims against the county. Claims against the city and city officials have not been settled, and Meyer said he believes they will face a larger judgment once those claims are eventually resolved.",
      "Marion County's administrator and attorneys for the city and county did not immediately return messages seeking comment.",
      "Raid's legality was questioned",
      "Under the judgment, the estate of Meyer's mother will receive $1 million. Meyer, two former Record reporters and the paper's business manager will split $1.1 million, and Ruth Herbel, the former city council member, will receive $650,000. Meyer said he's considering a fund to ensure that the paper remains financially viable or a program to encourage young journalists to work in communities like his.",
      "\"The goal isn't to get the money. The money is symbolic,\" Meyer said. \"The press has basically been under assault.\"",
      "Three days after the raid, the local prosecutor said there wasn't enough evidence to justify it. Experts said Marion's police chief at the time, Gideon Cody, was on legally shaky ground when he ordered it, and a former top federal prosecutor for Kansas suggested it might have been a criminal violation of civil rights.",
      "The federal\u00a0Privacy Protection Act\u00a0protects journalists and newsrooms from most searches by law enforcement, requiring police usually to issue subpoenas rather than search warrants.",
      "Doug Anstaett, a retired Kansas Press Association executive director, said Tuesday that the raid violated the state's shield law for journalists. It allows law enforcement agencies to seek subpoenas to obtain confidential information from news organizations but requires them to show a compelling interest and that they can't obtain it in another way. Anstaett was the association's executive director when the law was enacted in 2010.",
      "The Record is known for its aggressive coverage of local issues, and Anstaett suggested police where trying to \"get at\" Meyer because of his adversarial relationships with local officials, adding, \"it totally backfired.\"",
      "\"They didn't follow any of those requirements and therefore it was really a slam dunk in terms of whether they broke the law or not,\" he said.",
      "Genelle Belmas, a University of Kansas professor who teaches media law, described the raid as \"an egregious violation of the First Amendment rights\" of Meyer and the weekly.",
      "\"I share his hope that an award of this size serves as a deterrent against future ill-conceived warrants with political motivations,\" she said. \"And no amount of money brings Joan Meyer back. We need to stay vigilant against government incursions on the press.\"",
      "Sheriff issues apology",
      "The search warrants were premised on the idea that the newspaper and a reporter had illegally impersonated the local restaurant owner to obtain her driving record online and that the former city council member Herbel illegally circulated it by sending a cellphone screenshot to the city manager.",
      "Two special prosecutors who reviewed the raid and its aftermath said nearly a year later that the Record, its staff and Herbel had committed no crimes before the raid. The prosecutors also said the warrants signed by a judge contained inaccurate information from an \"inadequate investigation\" and that the searches were not legally justified. Cody resigned as police chief in October 2023 and was later charged with felony obstruction of justice.",
      "Cody is scheduled to go to trial in February in Marion County on a felony charge of interfering with a judicial process, accused by the two special prosecutors of persuading a potential witness to withhold information from authorities investigating his conduct. He had pleaded not guilty and did not respond to a text message Tuesday seeking comment about the county's agreement.",
      "The charge against Cody stems from text messages between him and the business owner after the raid. The business owner has said Cody asked her to delete text messages between them, fearing people could get a wrong idea about their relationship, which she said was professional and platonic.",
      "The Marion County Commission approved the agreement Monday after discussing it in private for 15 minutes.",
      "The agreement required Sheriff Jeff Soyez to issue an apology.",
      "\"The Sheriff's Office wishes to express its sincere regrets to Eric and Joan Meyer and Ruth and Ronald Herbel for its participation in the drafting and execution of the Marion County Police Department's search warrants on their homes and the Marion County Record,\" the sheriff's statement said.",
      "Meyer, the newspaper's publisher, said in a statement that the \"admission of wrongdoing is the most important part\" of the agreement.",
      "\"In our democracy, the press is a watchdog against abuse. If the watchdog itself is the target of abuse, and all it does is roll over, democracy suffers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans may soon be paying more for their favorite Italian pasta brands \u2014 or even have trouble finding imported spaghetti \u2014 as the Trump administration eyes a new import duty on 13 of Italy's largest pasta exporters.",
      "The proposal, published by the Commerce Department in September, would add a new 92% antidumping duty after a U.S. government probe\u00a0found\u00a0that some Italian pasta brands, including La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, were selling their products below U.S. market prices. Combined with the existing 15% tariff on European Union imports, the total duties on Italian-made pasta could rise to 107%.",
      "That would represent one of the Trump administration's highest import duty rates on any product, according to the Wall Street Journal, which earlier\u00a0reported\u00a0on the pasta dispute.",
      "If the anti-dumping duty goes into effect, the impact on American consumers would be substantial, according to Phil Lempert, food industry analyst and editor of SupermarketGuru. Some Italian pasta makers may simply stop exporting their products to the U.S., while others might raise their prices, he added.",
      "\"You don't have enough domestic manufacturing to fill up those shelves,\" Lempert said. \"So you're going to walk into the pasta aisle and you're going to see it half empty.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS News, \"Italian pasta is not 'disappearing.'\"",
      "He added that the antidumping duty is a proposal and that it is not yet final. \"The pasta makers still have several months to continue participating in this review before this preliminary finding becomes finalized,\" he said.",
      "Yet some Italian pasta companies are preparing to pull out of U.S. stores as soon as January because of the threat of the new antidumping duty, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Which pasta brands could be affected?",
      "The antidumping duties \u2014 a type of federal tariff applied to imported products sold in the U.S. for less than their market value \u2014 would impact 13 Italian pasta makers, including La Molisana and Garofalo, according to a U.S. Department of Commerce publication.

      "Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 Kris Edwards waited at home with friends for his wife, Erika \"Tilly\" Edwards, to go out to dinner, but she never made it back to the house they had purchased only four days earlier. Around 9 p.m. on June 29, a hit-and-run driver killed Tilly as she walked to her car after a fundraiser performance in Hollywood.",
      "\"I've just got to figure out how to keep living. And the hard part with that is not knowing why,\" Edwards said of his wife's death.",
      "Despite local, state, and federal safety campaigns, such as the global Vision Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities, such deaths are up 20% in the U.S. from a decade ago, from 32,744 in 2014 to an estimated 39,345 in 2024, according to data from the Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Although traffic deaths have declined since peaking at 43,230 in 2021, the number of deaths remains higher than a decade ago.",
      "Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pew Research Center found, Americans' driving habits have worsened across multiple measures, from reckless driving to drunk driving, which road safety advocates call a public health failure. They say technology could dramatically reduce traffic deaths, but proposals often run up against industry resistance, and the Trump administration is focusing on driverless cars to both innovate and improve public safety.",
      "\"Every day, 20 people go out for a walk, and they don't return home,\" said Adam Snider, a spokesperson for the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state road safety offices.",
      "American roads have become more dangerous than violent crimes in some cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Houston are among the major cities that now report more traffic fatalities than homicides. In 2024, the Los Angeles Police Department reported an estimated 268 homicides and 302 traffic deaths, the second consecutive year that the number of people killed in collisions exceeded the number of homicide victims, according to Crosstown LA, a nonprofit community news outlet.",
      "San Francisco reported 42 traffic deaths and 35 homicides in 2024. In Houston, approximately 345 people died in crashes and 322 from homicide.",
      "\"Simply put, the United States is in the middle of a road safety emergency,\" David Harkey, president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, testified during a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing this summer. Harkey said that, out of 29 high-income countries, America ranks at the bottom in road safety. \"This spike is not \u2014 I repeat, is not \u2014 a global trend. The U.S. is an outlier.\"",
      "In January 2017, then-Mayor Eric Garcetti joined 13 other L.A. city leaders in pledging to implement the Vision Zero action plan and eliminate traffic deaths in the city by 2025.",
      "Instead, deaths have increased.",
      "An audit\u00a0released in April that was commissioned by the city's administrative officer found that the level of enthusiasm for the program at City Hall has diminished and that it suffered because of \"the pandemic, conflicts of personality, lack of total buy-in for implementation, disagreements over how the program should be administered, and scaling issues.\" The report also cited competing interests among city departments and inconsistent investment in the city's most dangerous traffic corridors.",
      "Mayor Karen Bass' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Last year, California state Sen. Scott Wiener proposed a bill that would have required new cars sold in the state to include \"intelligent speed assistance,\" software that could prevent vehicles from exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph. But the bill was watered down following pushback from the auto industry and opposition from some legislators who called it government overreach. It was ultimately vetoed by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said a state mandate would disrupt ongoing federal safety assessments.",
      "Meanwhile, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an influential automotive lobby, this year sued the federal government over an automatic emergency braking rule adopted during the Biden administration. The lawsuit is pending in federal court while the Department of Transportation completes a review. Even before Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term, the alliance appealed to the president-elect in a letter to support consumer choice.",
      "Under President Trump, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is prioritizing the development of autonomous vehicles by proposing sweeping regulatory changes to test and deploy driverless cars. \"Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were written for vehicles with human drivers and need to be updated for autonomous vehicles,\" NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser said in September in announcing the modernization effort, which includes repealing some safety rules. \"Removing these requirements will reduce costs and enhance safety.\"",
      "Some Democratic lawmakers, however, have criticized the administration's repeal of safety rules as misguided since new rules can be implemented without undoing existing safeguards. NHTSA officials did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' concerns.",
      "Advocates worry that without continued adoption of road safety regulations for conventional vehicles, factors such as excessive speed and human error will continue to drive fatalities despite the push for driverless cars.",
      "\"We need to continue to have strong collaboration from the federal, state, local sectors, public sector, private sector, the everyday public,\" Snider, of the Governors Highway Safety Association, said. \"We need everyday drivers to get involved.\"",
      "It took nearly a month for police to track down the driver of a Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen allegedly involved in Tilly's death. Authorities have charged Davontay Robins with vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, felony hit-and-run driving, and driving with a suspended license due to a previous DUI. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges and is out on bail.",
      "Kris Edwards now tends to the couple's backyard garden by himself. Since his wife's death, he has experienced sleep deprivation, fatigue, and trouble eating, and he relies on a cane to walk. His doctors attribute his ailments to the brain's response to grief.",
      "\"I'm not alone,\" he said. \"But I am lonely, in this big, empty house without my partner.\"",
      "Edwards hopes for justice for his wife, though he said he's unsure if prosecutors will get a conviction. He wants her death to mean something: safer streets, slower driving, and for pedestrians to be cautious when getting in and out of cars parked on busy streets.",

    "summary": "Israel's president says Trump sent him a letter asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who's on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he received a letter from President Trump on Wednesday asking him to pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is on trial in three separate corruption cases.",
      "Netanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in the ongoing court cases, with no ruling yet delivered, and his supporters have dismissed the trials as politically motivated.",
      "In a speech to the Israeli parliament in October, Mr. Trump urged Herzog to pardon Netanyahu, telling the gathered lawmakers: \"By the way, that was not in the speech, as you probably know! But I happen to like this gentleman right over here [Netanyahu], and it just seems to make so much sense.\"",
      "\"This morning, President Isaac Herzog received the attached letter from U.S. President Donald Trump, calling on him to consider granting a pardon to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,\" Herzog's office said in a statement, adding that the president could not initiate a pardon based on the American leader's request alone.",
      "In his letter, Mr. Trump said he was writing to Herzog at a \"historic time, as we have, together, just secured peace that has been sought for at least 3,000 years.\"",
      "\"I hereby call on you to fully pardon Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been a formidable and decisive War Time Prime Minister,\" it added. \"While I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System ... I believe that this 'case' against Bibi ... is political, unjustified prosecution.\"",
      "Netanyahu has long been known by the nickname Bibi.",
      "Mr. Trump also framed his request for Netanyahu's pardon as something his Israeli counterpart deserved for working with the White House to reach the fragile ceasefire in Gaza, saying: \"Now that we have achieved these unprecedented successes, and are keeping Hamas in check, it is time to let Bibi unite Israel by pardoning him, and ending that lawfare once and for all.\"",
      "He and his wife Sara are accused in one case of accepting more than $260,000 worth of luxury goods including cigars, jewelry and champagne from billionaires in exchange for political favors. He is also accused of attempting to negotiate more favorable coverage from two Israeli media outlets in two other cases.",
      "In a statement posted later Wednesday to X, Netanyahu thanked Mr. Trump for his \"incredible support,\" adding: \"As usual, you get right to the point and call it like it is. I look forward to continuing our partnership to bolster security and expand peace.\"",
      "The statement from Herzog's office said the Israeli president holds Mr. Trump \"in the highest regard and continues to express his deep appreciations for President Trump's unwavering support for Israel.\"",
      "\"Alongside and not withstanding this ... anyone seeking a Presidential pardon must submit a formal request in accordance with the established procedures,\" it added.",
      "During his current term, which started in late 2022, Netanyahu proposed far-reaching judicial reforms that critics say sought to weaken the courts. Those prompted massive protests that were only curtailed after the onset of the Gaza war in October 2023.",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused his political opponents of using the Justice Department to target him during his time out of office, and since he returned to the White House, the department, now run by his appointees, has pushed for Biden-era justice officials to be prosecuted over an FBI investigation into the fallout of the 2020 election.",
      "In September, he\u00a0pushed\u00a0Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff. Comey and James have since been indicted on criminal charges.",

      "A diamond brooch that French emperor Napoleon lost while fleeing from the Battle of Waterloo in the early 19th century sold for more than 3.5 million Swiss francs \u2014 about $4.4 million \u2014 at a Geneva auction on Wednesday, Sotheby's said.",
      "The brooch, which can also be worn as a pendant, features an oval diamond weighing over 13 carats, surrounded by smaller cut diamonds.",
      "\"This historical and highly important diamond jewel was part of other personal belongings the Emperor had taken with him to Waterloo, including medals, weapons, silverware, a hat and a jewellery box containing dozens of loose diamonds as well as jewellery,\" Sotheby's said in a news release.",
      "\"In his haste to flee Waterloo, where his armies had been overwhelmed by the combined forces of the British and Prussian armies, Napoleon had to abandon some of his carriages when they got stuck in a muddy road a few miles away from the battlefield \u2014 including the carriage containing those precious belongings,\" it said.",
      "The sale price vastly outstripped the high end of the pre-sale estimate of 200,000 francs. The hammer price was 2.85 million francs, excluding fees and other charges that were included in the final aggregate price.",
      "Sotheby's did not disclose the identity of the seller, and said that the buyer was a \"private collector.\"",
      "The brooch and a few other items were offered to the Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm III as battle trophies in 1815 three days after the Battle of Waterloo, according to Sotheby's. It remained among heirlooms of the Prussian Royal House of Hohenzollern for centuries and over the last few years was part of a different private collection.",
      "Among dozens of lots on the auction block was a green beryl weighing over 132 carats, which Napoleon was said to have worn at his 1804 coronation. The jewel sold for a hammer price of 838,000 francs, or more than 17 times the high-end pre-sale estimate.",

      "The investigation, by the groups Human Rights Watch and Cristosal, found the detainees were victims of \"constant beatings\" by Salvadoran guards at the notorious CECOT maximum security prison, as well as other forms of mistreatment, including cases of sexual abuse. Investigators argued some of these alleged abuses constitute torture under international law.",

      "\"These beatings and other abuses appear to be part of a practice designed to subjugate, humiliate, and discipline detainees through the imposition of grave physical and physiological suffering,\" the report says. \"Officers also appear to have acted on the belief that their superiors either supported or tolerated their abusive acts.\"",
      "The human rights groups argued the U.S. government was \"complicit\" in the mistreatment they found, noting the Trump administration gave El Salvador $4.7 million in March, including to imprison deportees accused of having ties to Tren de Aragua, a gang that originated in Venezuela.",

    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

      "Islamabad, Pakistan\u00a0\u2014 A suicide bombing outside district court buildings in a residential area of the Pakistani capital killed at least a dozen people on Tuesday, Pakistan's interior minister said.",
      "\"At 12:39 p.m. (0239 Eastern), a suicide attack was carried out at the Kachehri (district courts) ... so far 12 people have been martyred and around 27 are wounded,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told reporters at the scene of the incident.",
      "\"As I entered the court building, a huge blast occurred. I thought the entire judiciary building would collapse on me,\" Zahid Khan, who works as an assistant to a lawyer at the court, told CBS News' Sami Yousafzai. \"When I went upstairs, I saw people lying on the ground around the fire \u2026 Just three minutes earlier, I had been at that exact spot while parking my bike.\"",
      "\"I saw many people lying injured, with blood on the road,\" he said.",
      "He noted the timing of the attack, coming a week after the Pakistani Taliban, or TTP, along with some elements of the Afghan Taliban issued threats against Pakistani cities.",
      "Pakistani later issued a statement, saying te government \"strongly condemns the cowardly suicide attack in Islamabad that claimed 12 innocent lives, including members of the judiciary.\"",
      "\"The Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) has claimed responsibility for this reprehensible act, aimed at spreading fear and undermining Pakistan's justice system,\" the statement said.",
      "The alleged suicide attack in Islamabad also came a day after militants stormed a military college in Wana, in Pakistan's South Waziristan region. Two militants were killed in the assault, officials said.",
      "The TTP, in statements shared with CBS News, denied involvement in both the Islamabad and Wana attacks, but Pakistani security officials and analysts said the group was likely responsible for both.",
      "Last week, a TTP source told CBS News the group considers its campaign against Pakistan's government a \"holy struggle,\" and they warned that it has \"human and technical resources in all major cities\" \u2014 and plans to stage new, large-scale attacks.",
      "The attacker tried on Tuesday to \"enter the court premises but, failing to do so, targeted a police vehicle,\" Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi told journalists. He alleged that the attack was \"carried out by Indian-backed elements and Afghan Taliban proxies\" linked to the TTP, but he said authorities were \"looking into all aspects\" of the explosion.",
      "In a statement issued later Tuesday, Indian government spokesperson Shri Randhir Jaiswal said the country \"unequivocally rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations\" by Pakistan, calling it \"a predictable tactic by Pakistan to concoct false narratives against India.\"",
      "Pakistan's Minister of Defense Khawaja Asif blamed Afghanistan's Taliban rulers for allowing the attack to take place on Tuesday. The neighbors have long had tense relations, with Islamabad accusing Afghan authorities of allowing the TTP to operate within Afghanistan's borders.",
      "\"Kabul's rulers can stop terrorism in Pakistan, but today's suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts proves this is a nationwide war,\" Asif said in a statement Tuesday. \"Anyone who believes the Pakistan Army is only fighting on the Afghan-Pakistan border and in remote Balochistan should take this attack as a wake-up call. This is a war for all of Pakistan.\"",
      "Pakistan and Afghanistan held two rounds of talks aimed at addressing mutual security concerns in October and earlier this month, but both ended without any solid agreement between the neighbors, and Asif said in his statement after the Tuesday explosion in Islamabad that, \"in this environment, it would be futile to place greater hope in successful negotiations with the rulers in Kabul.\"",

      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration sent nobody to the U.N. global climate summit, leaving California Governor Gavin Newsom to ask, \"What the hell is going on here?\"",
    "story": [
      "In Bel\u00e9m, the bustling Brazilian gateway to the Amazon rainforest, leaders from nearly 200 nations have gathered for the United Nations' 30th Climate Change Conference, known as COP30, to chart difficult next steps in the global fight against climate change. But the absence of the leaders from the world's three largest greenhouse gas emitters \u2014 China, the United States and India \u2014 cast a shadow over the summit as it kicked off.",
      "Beijing and New Delhi did dispatch senior-level delegations for the two-week summit. The White House, however, said no high-level U.S. officials would attend this year's COP. President Trump has repeatedly dismissed human-caused climate change as \"a hoax.\"",
      "Two Democratic governors, California's Gavin Newsom and New Mexico's Michelle Lujan Grisham, were in Brazil to attend the summit, representing state-level U.S. efforts to curb emissions.",
      "\"What the hell is going on here?\" Newsom asked at a global investors' summit in S\u00e3o Paulo on Monday, where he fired off a characteristic criticism of the Trump administration. \"We're in Brazil \u2014 one of our great trading partners, one of the world's great democracies. Home to all the rare earth metals we need. This is the country we should be engaging with, not slapping with 50% tariffs.\"",
      "Ten years ago, 195 nations taking part in the COP21 summit signed onto the landmark Paris Agreement, intended to commit individual nations to take measures that, collectively, would limit the rise in average global temperatures to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). The objective in the agreement, which the Obama administration signed, was to pursue efforts to cap the global temperature increase at 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "That target now appears out of reach.",
      "Based on national plans submitted this year, the planet is on course to warm by roughly 2.5\u00b0C (4.5\u00b0F) during this century. The Earth's average surface temperature in 2024 was the hottest since record keeping began in 1880 \u2014 and the last 10 years have all ranked among the warmest ever observed.",
      "Still, U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell told delegates in Brazil this week that after three decades of dedicated talks, \"we are now bending the curve of planet heating emissions downwards \u2014 for the very first time.\"",
      "\"I am not sugarcoating it,\" Stiell hastened to add. \"We have so much more work to do.\"",
      "A new U.N. analysis released this week shows that, if current national commitments are met, global emissions should fall by about 12% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels. That's an improvement from last month's projection of 10%, but still far short of the 60% reduction scientists say would be needed to keep warming within the Paris Agreement's 1.5\u00b0C goal.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has been pressing for stronger action, warning that surpassing the 1.5\u00b0C limit now looks almost inevitable and slamming it as both a \"moral failure\" and \"deadly negligence\" putting the lives of billions of people at risk.",
      "Despite low expectations for any sweeping breakthroughs, the delegations at COP30 are broadly expected to update national commitments to curb emissions in the next decade.",
      "A Brazil-led initiative to raise $125 billion for rainforest protection, coupled with renewed scrutiny of fossil fuel companies \u2014 which Guterres accused of \"holding back change\" while collecting record profits and government subsidies \u2014 were also expected to come out of the two-week gathering.",
      "There is also likely to be more pressure applied on the governments of wealthy nations to help finance climate adaptations around the world, to help developing countries mitigate the impacts of a warming planet.",
      "At last year's COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, countries agreed on an aspirational goal of mobilizing $1.3 trillion annually by 2035, with at least $300 billion expected to come from developing economies.",
      "Publicly available data on how much climate finance has actually been delivered since then, however, remains scarce, and that could be a key point of contention for the negotiators gathered in Bel\u00e9m to discuss.",

    "story": [
      "Stockholm \u2014 A rising number of mysterious drone sightings near airports and military bases has fueled concern in Europe over alleged Russian incursions into NATO airspace, with some of America's allies already saying the continent is in a gray zone between peace and war \u2014 accusing Moscow of escalating \"hybrid warfare.\"",
      "NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is arguably the United States' most important alliance, enduring for over 75 years. In Sweden, CBS News saw that alliance in action this week \u2014 in waters contested by Russia.",
      "Our team watched as an enemy submarine prepared for a covert espionage and sabotage mission in the Baltic Sea against America's NATO allies in northern Europe.",
      "It was just a military exercise, launched from Stockholm's harbor, and a German submarine played the role of the unnamed enemy being hunted by NATO forces across the Baltic Sea.",
      "U.S. forces took part, flying overhead in spy planes.",
      "\"NATO is a defensive alliance,\" Commander Arlo Abrahamson, a U.S. Navy officer and a spokesman for NATO's maritime headquarters, which has been closely monitoring Russia's military build-up in the Baltic, told CBS News. \"The potential threats of adversaries in this region are interconnected throughout the world.\"",
      "Abrahamson said that if northern Europe is drawn into a conflict, it would have a negative impact on the United States, too.",
      "Several of America's NATO allies share a Baltic coastline with Russia. In recent years, Russia is suspected of carrying out multiple acts of sabotage \u2014 including damaging undersea data cables that are the backbone of the global internet.",
      "Some believe Russia is using the Baltic Sea as a testing ground, to see how much damage it could do to the West's economy if it ever went to war with NATO. Undersea cables carry trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day.",
      "The country leading the exercises this week, Sweden, gave CBS News rare access to one of its stealth warships, the HMS Helsingborg, as it hunted for the pseudo-enemy sub.",
      "For more than 200 years, Sweden maintained a policy of military non-alignment, but last year, following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, it became NATO's newest member.",
      "\"We face the Russians every day, sharing the same duck pond, so to say,\" submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg, of the Swedish navy, told CBS News.",
      "She echoed Lithuanian officials' recent accusation that Russia is engaged in a kind of hybrid warfare with the alleged airspace violations and acts of sabotage.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" she said. \"We're somewhere in between.\"",
      "Wallenburg agreed that the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a high-stakes face off that never quite turned into a full-scale war.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "The Kremlin has actually said already that Russia is at war with NATO, because of the alliance's support for Ukraine.",
      "America's NATO allies around the Baltic Sea, including Sweden, Finland, Poland and Germany, have all resolved to significantly boost their domestic military spending and beef up their defenses.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The outgoing director of the BBC addressed staff of the publicly-funded British national broadcaster in a call on Tuesday admitting mistakes were made but urging them to \"fight for our journalism\" after President Trump threatened to sue the corporation for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\"I do hear everyone when we have to be very clear and stand up for our journalism. We are in a unique and precious organization, and I see the free press under pressure. I see the weaponization. I think we've got to fight for our journalism,\" Tim Davie said in the Tuesday call.",
      "Davie gave three main reasons for his decision to step down from his role, including the demanding nature of the job and the upcoming BBC Charter renewal process that will take place in the U.K.",
      "He also said: \"I think we did make a mistake and there was an editorial breach and some responsibility had to be taken. So putting that together, that's what made my decision.\"",
      "There was no direct mention of Mr. Trump's threat of legal action, but Davie said political pressures on the BBC from both the U.K. and abroad were \"challenging.\"",
      "In a letter to the BBC's legal team dated November 9, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the October 28, 2024 episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, called \"Trump: A Second Chance,\" which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of a speech made by Mr. Trump on Jan. 6.",
      "The letter claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law.",
      "It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology, and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. Eastern, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages. The BBC is on notice.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the BBC said Monday that it would \"review the letter and respond in due course.\"",
      "U.K. media lawyer Mark Stephens said it would be hard for Mr. Trump to sue the BBC in the United States.",
      "\"Panorama wasn't broadcast in the USA, and BBC iPlayer (the BBC's streaming platform) isn't available \u2026 so it's not clear that any U.S. court would have jurisdiction to hear the claim,\" Stephens said on the BBC's breakfast program.",
      "The Director General of the BBC, Tim Davie, and its CEO of news, Debora Turness, resigned Sunday amid criticism of the program.",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said in a letter to staff.",
      "Turness said the controversy around the Panorama episode about Mr. Trump had \"reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "Pressure on the top BBC executives mounted after Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper published a leaked memo compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines. Among other things, the memo was critical of the editing of the Panorama episode.",

    "summary": "Mexican authorities arrested a former intelligence agent suspected of involvement in the 1994 assassination of presidential favorite Luis Donaldo Colosio.",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors in Mexico arrested another alleged accomplice in the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, a crime that shocked the country and remains unsolved, even though the confessed killer has been imprisoned for more than 30 years.",
      "A federal official who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, confirmed Monday to The Associated Press that Jorge Antonio S\u00e1nchez Ortega was arrested in Tijuana in connection with Colosio's assassination. The official did not specify the charges against S\u00e1nchez Ortega, who is being held in a maximum-security prison in central Mexico, awaiting trial.",
      "According to the National Registry of Detentions, the arrest took place on Saturday.",
      "Colosio, the 1994 presidential candidate for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), was shot twice during a rally in the northern Mexican city of Tijuana. Since 2024, federal prosecutors have been seeking to prosecute an intelligence agent assigned as his bodyguard, identified only as Jorge Antonio \"S,\" as the alleged perpetrator of the second shooting.",
      "As of Monday, the prosecutor's office had not officially commented on the arrest of S\u00e1nchez Ortega, and authorities have not confirmed whether new evidence has emerged.",
      "According to reports, S\u00e1nchez Ortega was employed then as an agent for the Center of Investigation and National Security - back then Mexico's equivalent of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "Mario Aburto has been serving a 45-year prison sentence since 1994 after declaring himself the sole perpetrator of the assassination, a confession he later retracted, claiming he was tortured.",
      "As a result of Aburto's complaints, during the administration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (2019-2024) the National Human Rights Commission recommended that the federal prosecutor's office reopen the investigation.",
      "Colosio's murder triggered a major political crisis in Mexico and was always surrounded by controversy fueled by the possibility that it was encouraged by certain spheres of power, amid internal struggles within the ruling PRI to choose a successor of then-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.",
      "In a January 2024 statement, the Attorney General's Office said there was evidence that the agent assigned to Colosio's security was at the scene and had clothing stained with the victim's blood. It also stated that ballistic evidence indicated that he fired a weapon - with only a difference of seconds between the two shots - and witnesses saw him flee immediately after the shooting.",
      "In the same statement, the agency considered it confirmed that the National Security and Investigation Center, which in 1994 was under the Ministry of the Interior, sent the agent to the scene of the assassination only to later \"cover for him and take him out of Tijuana urgently and surreptitiously.\" The statement concluded that the agent's immediate release was \"an evident criminal cover-up.\"",
      "Since Colosio's assassination, other politicians have been targeted by violence in Mexico.\u00a0In 2010, a front-running gubernatorial candidate, Rodolfo Torre, was assassinated in northern Mexico. Plagued by drug-related violence for decades, the country has also seen numerous local politicians murdered recently, including a mayor who was beheaded in 2024.",

      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",

    "story": [
      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",
      "President Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.",
      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",
      "A report out earlier this year from the World Meteorological Organization warned that climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",
      "In a mission statement published ahead of COP30, organizers wrote, \"We have made progress, but not enough. Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present.\"",
      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.\"",
      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "In a two-year study of people with periodontitis or severe gum disease, researchers from University College London (UCL) found that those who got intensive treatment \u2014 a full-mouth deep cleaning with regular follow-ups \u2014 had slower thickening and clogging of a major neck artery and better blood-vessel function than those who only got routine cleanings.",
      "The randomized controlled trial tracked 135 adults at UCL\u2019s Eastman Dental Institute who had periodontitis, which can stem from poor oral hygiene, genetics, smoking or uncontrolled diabetes, according to the research published this month in the European Heart Journal.",

      "At 12 and 24 months, participants who received intensive deep cleanings showed less gum inflammation and fewer bacteria entering the bloodstream, and their arteries were healthier than those who got standard scale-and-polish care, which only removes plaque and tartar buildup.",
      "A new study found that deep dental cleanings could benefit heart health. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Marco Orlandi, co-author of the trial, said in a statement that the participants who received the intensive gum disease treatment had a 0.02 millimeter reduction in the thickening of their carotid arteries after two years.",
      "\"This is a significant result, as even a 0.01 millimeter reduction corresponds to a 10% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting participants reduced their risk by around 10% each year,\" Orlandi said.",
      "Doctors track the thickness of the carotid artery wall as an early warning sign for clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This study didn\u2019t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.",

      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",

      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",

      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",

      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",

      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new report from a government watchdog group begs the question of why \u2014 with nearly 800,000 federal bureaucrats drawing six-figure salaries and the average payroll of the federal workforce far outpacing its size \u2014 is Washington still unable to fund the basics of government?",
      "Open The Books, a project of American Transparency, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, nonpartisan charitable organization, closely tracks government spending and released an expansive report Wednesday ahead of a looming agreement between Republicans and Democrats to reopen the government, showing the swamp has gotten bigger, richer and more secretive since 2020.",
      "The report, which analyzed all publicly disclosed federal salaries for fiscal year 2024, found a total of 2.9 million civil service employees with a total payroll of $270 billion, plus an additional 30% for benefits. While the total number of employees rose by 5% since 2020, payroll grew nearly five times as much.",

      "The current federal workforce is costing American taxpayers $673,000 per minute, $40.4 million per hour and just under $1 billion per day, according to Open The Books. This includes almost 1,000 workers who are making more than the president's $400,000 per year salary, 31,452 non-War Department federal employees who made more than every governor of all 50 states and 793,537 people making $100,000 or more. Those making $300,000 or more have seen an 84% increase since 2020, while there has similarly been an 82% increase in those earning $200,000 or more, the report points out.",
      "During Open The Book's investigation, the fiscal watchdog group also found that the names of 383,000 federal workers across 56 different agencies were redacted, amounting to a total of $38.3 billion in pay. According to Open The Books CEO John Hart, \"You can't have accountability without visibility.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration has a historic opportunity to bring much-needed transparency to the administrative state.

      "\"Our investigators found far too many redactions and blind spots that DOGE should have already fixed. You can't have accountability without visibility. Taxpayers need a much clearer picture of the federal workforce than they have today.\"",
      "U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, has been working with Open The Books to fight for greater transparency. In a letter sent in September to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Ernst said she had identified \"numerous examples\" of full-time federal employees earning two salaries while moonlighting for other agencies or government contractors, something typically prohibited under the law. Ernst pointed out that this was being done without the approval or knowledge of these workers' managers.",

      "\"From 2021 to 2024, a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employee held multiple other full-time government contractor jobs, frequently billing taxpayers for more than 24 hours of work in a single day,\" Ernst chronicled in her letter. \"In addition to HUD, she was paid by AmeriCorps and the National Institutes of Health. Since she teleworked in all three positions, she was able to hide her overlapping jobs and get away with billing taxpayers $225,866 for hours she never worked. She claimed she worked 26 hours on 13 of the 21 workdays in a single month.\"",
      "Ernst also described a second example of a human resources official at the Peace Corps who was caught falsifying time cards submitted to different agencies, which led to the employee double-billing taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars. She laid out several other examples in the letter as well.",
      "\"Until recently, outside of death and taxes, the expanding Washington bureaucracy was one of the few certainties in life,\" said Ernst. \"I am proud to have partnered with the Trump administration and DOGE to successfully downsize the bloated bureaucracy, but there is much more work to be done to make Washington more efficient.\"",
      "One can \"look no further\" than the \"failed Schumer shutdown,\" Ernst said, pointing out that taxpayers will be on the hook for more than $12 billion in back pay for 750,000 non-essential federal employees who did not work for a month and a half.",

      "The bill would require executive agencies to submit detailed reports to Congress within 30 days of a lapse in appropriations that must include the total number of employees and contractors employed by the agency at the time of the shutdown, the total salaries paid by the agency during the prior fiscal year, the number of furloughed during the lapse and their annual pay, the number of employees not furloughed and the sum of their pay and a requirement that all this information be posted publicly on the agencies' websites."

The statement also touted El-Sayed's endorsements from individuals in the law enforcement community.",
      "\"On his third week as Wayne County\u2019s Health Officer, Dr. El-Sayed declared a public health emergency at the Juvenile Detention Facility, working alongside law enforcement to fully rebuild it from the studs, raising officers\u2019 wages by 35% and funding a safer, more humane system,\" the statement said. \"He learned and grew through the process\u2014and has earned endorsements from a sitting Sheriff, a former Sheriff, and a Detroit Police Commissioner.\"",
      "The campaign statement also slammed President Donald Trump's \"militarizing\" of agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and argued that \"rather than defund Police\" El-Sayed is \"challenging\" the government to reconsider the way it allocates its money.",
      "\"Rather than defund Police, Dr. El-Sayed is challenging government choices that defund food, healthcare, and social services while militarizing agencies like ICE in sharp contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency because real safety comes from investing in people\u2014not in tanks and tear gas,\"\u00a0the campaign statement concluded.",

      "President Donald Trump issued pardons for more than 70 people accused of seeking to overturn the 2020 election results.",
      "The move largely has been viewed as a symbolic gesture, as the presidential pardons only cover federal charges and those involved don\u2019t have any federal charges leveled against them.",
      "Among those pardoned were Trump allies like former New York City mayor and the president's former personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who peddled claims that the 2020 election was \"stolen\" from Trump and is embroiled in a case in Arizona where he faces state charges for election interference.",

But those are not things a presidential pardon can do.\"",
      "For example, Giuliani was disbarred in both New York and Washington in 2024. The Manhattan appeals court in New York determined in July 2024 that Giuliani routinely made inaccurate statements about the 2020 election, and the decision said he \"baselessly attacked and undermined the integrity of this country\u2019s electoral process.\"",

      "China has agreed to tighten chemicals used to produce fentanyl following a visit by FBI Director Kash Patel, he announced Wednesday.",
      "After Patel met with his Chinese counterparts, the Chinese government agreed to designate all 13 precursors and to control seven chemical subsidiaries used to make the lethal drug that has been blamed for thousands of American deaths each year, the FBI director announced at a White House press briefing on Wednesday.",
      "\"This was a historic trip for the FBI and America\u2019s national security \u2013 the first time in a decade that an FBI Director has been to China and received an audience with his counterpart to discuss the fentanyl crisis,\" Patel said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital. \"The crisis doesn\u2019t start at America\u2019s borders \u2013 it starts with the flow of chemical precursors and the networks that move them. \u00a0President Trump instructed his team to use all tools at our disposal to work with partners and cut off the precursor pipelines at their origin \u2013 and that\u2019s what we accomplished.\"The FBI reached an agreement with the government of China to have 13 precursors listed and 7 chemicals restricted, a victory that will ultimately crush fentanyl traffickers and save so many American lives for generations to come,\" he added. \"We are dismantling the infrastructure that fuels this crisis at its source.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Kids are spending more time online than ever, and that early exposure is opening the door to a new kind of danger.",
      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",

      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online. Whether it's a pop-up claiming a prize, a strange link in a chat or a voice message that sounds familiar, remind them it's always okay to ask you first. Quick conversations like these can prevent costly mistakes and turn learning moments into trust-building ones.",
      "Outdated software can leave gaps that scammers exploit. Regularly update operating systems, browsers and apps to close those holes. Add strong antivirus software. Explain to your child that updates and scans keep their favorite games and videos running safely, not just their parents happy.",
      "The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't save these conversations for when something goes wrong. Bring them up casually during family time or when watching YouTube or gaming together. Treat digital safety like any other life skill, something practiced daily and improved with time. The more normal it feels, the more confident your child becomes when facing online risks.",
      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "The dream of personal flight has always felt just out of reach, until now. A company called AltoVolo has unveiled something that might make it real: the world's first eVTOL configurator.",
      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "With AltoVolo\u2019s world-first online configurator, you can design every detail of your Sigma eVTOL. (AltoVolo)",
      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here:\u00a0CyberGuy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AltoVolo's Sigma may not replace your car anytime soon, but it gives us a glimpse of what's coming: a world where flight is cleaner, quieter and designed around the individual. It's a preview of how the future of travel might not be on the road at all, but instead in the air.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",
      "POWER ON THE MOVE: IS PILOT PROGRAM THE FUTURE OF EV CHARGING?",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "This\u00a0PLOS Climate study reinforces that after the first two years, EVs deliver real and lasting climate benefits. As the U.S. grid shifts toward cleaner energy, its impact grows even stronger. The authors note that the analysis does not include emissions from recycling or charging infrastructure, yet it remains one of the most thorough long-term views of EV adoption and its effects on the economy and environment.",

      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

    "story": [
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, says \"standing with Israel is in our strategic interest.\"",
      "Critics once called it isolationist. But national security experts now say Donald Trump\u2019s \"America First\" strategy is proving to be something else entirely \u2014 a hard-nosed policy of deterrence built on strong alliances, especially with Israel.",
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security and former chief of staff at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that \"The America First approach to U.S. national security means a strong national security policy, a decisive president, keeping our nation out of unnecessary wars, having members of alliances carry their own weight, but it also means standing strongly with Israel and fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "He said supporting Israel is not about sentiment. \"Standing with Israel is in our strategic interest,\" he said. \"Israel is dealing with enemies in the region that the U.S. would have to deal with if it were not there. So it\u2019s in our strategic interest.\"",
      "STATE DEPARTMENT UNVEILS PATRIOTIC 'AMERICA FIRST' REBRAND AS PART OF SWEEPING MAKEOVER",
      "President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s \"20-point peace plan\" for Gaza exemplifies the America First balance between toughness and diplomacy. \"It achieved its two primary objectives, getting all the living hostages out of Israel and enacting a ceasefire,\" he said, acknowledging that \"the ceasefire is fairly shaky.\" The next step, he added, is \"an international stabilization force\" \u2014 a complex process still under negotiation.",

      "That number represents a simple majority of the entire 435-member House chamber.",
      "Under House rules, once a discharge petition hits that magic number of 218 signatures, the House must act on it, though seven legislative days must pass before a vote can be called.",
      "But Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who has opposed the effort, said Wednesday that he would expedite the process and bring the Epstein measure to the floor next week.",
      "It is expected to pass the House, but it still would need to clear the GOP-controlled Senate and be signed by the president to become law, which is unlikely.",
      "\"There's still time for him to be the hero,\" Massie said Wednesday of Trump. \"He could release all the files himself.\"",
      "But \"it seems like they were all scrambling over there to stop this,\" Massie said of the White House.",
      "Grijalva signed the discharge petition on the same day that Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a new tranche of emails from Epstein to his associate, Ghislaine Maxwell, and a journalist, which were provided to the panel by the Epstein estate. Epstein says in one 2019 email that Trump \u201cknew about the girls.\u201d",
      "In another email Epstein allegedly sent to Maxwell in 2011, Epstein says Trump \u201cspent hours\u201d with someone the committee says was a victim. The White House disputed the emails, with press secretary Karoline Leavitt saying they were \u201cselectively leaked\u201d by Democrats \u201cto create a fake narrative to smear President Trump.\u201d",
      "NBC News has not independently verified the emails.",

      "The bill contains some limited exemptions, including for personally identifiable information of victims and for classified information.",
      "Grijalva was supposed to take the oath of office shortly after her Sept. 23 election victory. But the government shut down a week later, and Speaker Johnson refused to swear in Grijalva until a handful of Senate Democrats joined Republicans in voting to reopen the government.",
      "They did so on Monday, and the House is set to pass the funding bill Wednesday night.",
      "The seven-week delay sparked Democratic protests outside the speaker\u2019s office; on one occasion, Democrats verbally sparred with Johnson himself.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of \u201cintentionally hiding the Jeffrey Epstein\u201d files in remarks to reporters Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable that for seven-plus weeks, Representative-elect Adelita Grijalva ... decisively has been denied the ability to serve more than 800,000 people in Arizona. And why is that the case? It\u2019s because Republicans are running a pedophile protection program,\u201d Jeffries said.",

      "Grijalva becoming the 218th signature on the discharge petition marks a dramatic development in the Epstein saga, which has dogged President Donald Trump and his administration since July, when the Justice Department and FBI published a short memo stating that their Epstein records contained no \u201cincriminating \u2018client list\u2019\u201d or evidence that would lead to additional prosecution of third parties.",
      "That information was at odds with what Kash Patel himself had said about the existence of a client list before he became Trump\u2019s FBI director this year. And the fight over the Epstein files has driven a wedge between Trump and some in his MAGA base who say they want justice for Epstein\u2019s victims.",
      "\u201cWhat the hell are the House Republicans doing?\u201d Patel told conservative media personality Benny Johnson on his podcast in 2024. \u201cThey have the majority. You can\u2019t get the list? ... Put on your big boy pants and let us know who the pedophiles are!\u201d",
      "After the Trump administration\u2019s memo, Massie and Khanna began building bipartisan support for their discharge petition. As lawmakers returned from their five-week summer recess in early September, the pair held a news conference outside the Capitol with more than a half dozen women who said Epstein and Maxwell had abused them when they were minors. Some said they had been trafficked to Epstein\u2019s island in the Caribbean or his ranch in New Mexico.",
      "Four Republicans \u2014 Massie, along with Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., and Nancy Mace, R-S.C. \u2014 signed on to the discharge petition, as did all 212 Democrats.",
      "Mace, who said she was sexually abused when she was a teenager, said on X that she will \"defend every last attack on President Trump to the death, everywhere,\" adding: \"I will NEVER abandon other survivors.\"",
      "But Speaker Johnson has slammed the discharge effort as \u201creckless\u201d and unnecessary. The House Oversight Committee is already investigating the matter, he said, and has been releasing troves of records from both the government and the Epstein estate. Many of the first batch of files released by the committee had already been made public. It then released a 2003 book of congratulatory letters to mark Epstein\u2019s 50th birthday, provided to the committee by his estate. The book included a lewd message allegedly from Trump, who has denied its authenticity.",
      "Johnson has warned that releasing all the files could risk making public \u201cinnocent people\u2019s names and reputations,\u201d as well as disclosing the identities of Epstein victims who do not want to come forward. But the legislation states the attorney general may withhold or redact records that \u201ccontain personally identifiable information of victims or victims\u2019 personal and medical files ... the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Trump and top White House officials last month began burning up the phone lines and whipping on-the-fence Republicans to ensure they didn\u2019t sign the discharge petition.",
      "Boebert said on X that she met with White House officials earlier Wednesday, though she never took her name off the petition.",
      "\"That\u2019s a defining factor of transparency ... having discussions with members of Congress about various issues,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said after being asked about the Boebert meeting. \"And I\u2019m not going to detail conversations that took place in the Situation Room, in the press briefing room.\"",
      "Trump himself has dismissed efforts in Congress to force the release of the files as a \u201cDemocrat Epstein Hoax,\u201d and a White House official said it would be seen as a \u201chostile act\u201d to the president if Republicans support it.",
      "In early September, Massie and Khanna had appeared to hit an impasse, stuck at 216 signatures and unable to convince any other Republicans to get on board.",
      "But they got their 217th signature on Sept. 10 after Democrat James Walkinshaw won a special election to replace his former boss, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., who died earlier this year.",
      "Grijalva put Massie and Khanna over the top with the 218th signature after winning another special election to succeed her father, longtime Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz., who died in March.",
      "CORRECTION (Nov. 12, 2025, 12:27 p.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the state Boebert represents. It is Colorado, not Georgia."

      "\u201cIt is our longstanding policy to not comment on intelligence matters,\u201d the Downing Street spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThe U.S. is our closest ally on security and intelligence. We continue to work together to uphold global peace and security, defend freedom of navigation, and respond to emerging threats.\u201d",
      "CNN first reported the suspension of intelligence sharing on narcotics trafficking vessels in Latin America.",

      "Britain, France and the Netherlands have territories in the Caribbean and have long worked with the United States and other regional governments to try to stem narcotics trafficking. In the past decade, cocaine smuggling to Europe from South America via the Caribbean has spiked, according to government reports and experts.",
      "Former military lawyers, legal experts and Democrats in Congress say the strikes violate international and U.S. laws that prohibit using military force to target civilians. They argue that drug gangs do not meet the legal standard of an armed group at war with the United States.",
      "The subject of America\u2019s military attacks on alleged drug smuggling boats came up during a meeting in Canada of foreign ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, Kaja Kallas, the European Union\u2019s foreign affairs chief, told NBC News.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday denied that Britain had stopped sharing intelligence. He also said his counterparts did not raise the U.S. military campaign in Latin America and intelligence support for the operation during the discussions.",
      "\u201cNot with me \u2014 no one raised it,\u201d Rubio told reporters after the meeting in Niagara-on-the-Lake, near the U.S. border.",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t come up once,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "He added: \u201cAgain, nothing has changed or happened that is impeded in any way our ability to do what we\u2019re doing, nor are we asking anyone to help us with what we\u2019re doing \u2014 in any realm. And that includes military.\u201d",
      "Asked about European concerns as to whether the U.S. was adhering to international law with its boat strikes, Rubio said it was up to the United States to safeguard its security.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that the European Union gets to determine what international law is. What they certainly don\u2019t get to determine is how the United States defends its national security,\u201d Rubio said.",

      "Canada\u2019s intelligence service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "On the legality of the strikes, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters Tuesday: \u201cDecisions on this are a matter for the U.S. Issues around whether or not anything is against international law is a matter for a competent international court, not for governments to determine.\u201d",

      "The Trump administration, however, maintains that drug cartels pose a threat to America\u2019s national security by transporting narcotics to the United States that claim tens of thousands of lives each year. The administration has labeled multiple cartels from Venezuela, Mexico and elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The strikes, which began in early September, have killed at least 75 people, according to numbers announced by the Pentagon.",

    "summary": "A flu strain that emerged over the summer is causing outbreaks in other countries. The CDC hasn't provided any insights on what's happening in the U.S. in weeks.",
    "story": [
      "As flu season gets underway, global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the virus that popped up in June \u2014 four months after the makeup of this year\u2019s flu shots had been decided.",
      "The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are warning about the early wave that\u2019s sending people to the hospital.",
      "\u201cSince it emerged, it\u2019s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.",
      "The version of H3N2 that\u2019s circulated worldwide this year \u201cacquired 7 new mutations over the summer,\u201d Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases at Scotland\u2019s University of Glasgow, said in a media statement. That \u201cmeans the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year\u2019s vaccine,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.K. is heading \u201cinto what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,\u201d the head of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, James Mackey, said last week.",
      "It\u2019s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."

      "On Nov. 5, Taylor Swift was spotted wearing a stunning yellow gold diamond lock necklace and a diamond chain lariat during a date night with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce in New York City.",
      "Word quickly spread that the items came from the Elbaums\u2019 brand, Audry Rose, which the couple founded in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a top 10 life moment kind of thing,\u201d Kevin Elbaum tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with his wife, calling the experience \u201csurreal.\u201d",
      "The married couple first learned that Swift was a fan of their jewelry while they were sitting down to dinner with their family.",
      "\u201cOne of my friends, she just saw it and she calls me and was like, \u2018I think this is your necklace.\u2019 And so I open up Instagram and I zoom in and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that is my necklace,\u2019\u201d Jaclyn Elbaum recalls.",

      "The couple was especially touched by Swift's selections. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer wore two pieces from their collection that hold special meaning to their family.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum designed the Pave Diamond Lock Necklace around five years ago and says the piece is \u201creally close to my heart.\u201d",
      "Every part of the necklace is handmade, including the chain, which is named after the couple\u2019s daughter Sloan.",

      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",
      "Even in their wildest dreams, the Elbaums had never imagined something like this could happen to their small business.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a publicist or anything. We hadn\u2019t tried to get it to her, so we really were completely blindsided that this could even happen. We assumed the only way it could happen was if you got it to her stylist or something,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Ever since the photo of Swift wearing their jewelry went viral, the Elbaums have noticed an uptick in traffic to their brand\u2019s website and more people purchasing the $7,800 lock necklace.",
      "They\u2019ve since added a sterling silver version of the lock necklace that retails for $890.",
      "The Elbaums say they're incredibly grateful for Swift's support of small businesses.",
      "\"We would have paid her to have the necklace. This is clearly a passion project for her to just sprinkle the Taylor aura around to businesses she likes, so it\u2019s really special,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum adds that Swift \"clearly cares about the craft and how things are made.\"",
      "After seeing the photo of Swift wearing items from their brand, the Elbaums emailed the singer's team to express their gratitude.",
      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoiler alert for Season 2, Episode 1 of \u201cPalm Royale.\u201d",
      "\u201cPalm Royale\u201d Season 1 ended with a bang and started with one as well.",
      "The finale of the Apple TV+ show ended with Ricky Martin\u2019s character, Robert, accidentally getting shot by Mary (Julia Duffy) after she attempted to assassinate President Nixon. The final scene showed Robert, who was pretending to be Astronaut Grant, bleeding on the floor.",
      "With Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiering Nov. 12, fans are curious to know: Is Robert dead?",
      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re not saying he (dies),\u201d creator Abe Sylvia previously told TODAY.com following the 2024 finale. \u201cThis is a classic soap opera cliffhanger.\u201d",
      "The showrunner also noted that if people looked closer, he was still breathing. But did Robert survive?",
      "Season 2 begins with a major musical production. Maxine Dellacorte (Kristen Wiig) returns to the Palm Royale and orders a drink, but instead of her signature cocktail, a grasshopper, she gets served a martini.",
      "When she asks the waiter where Robert is, he says he's getting ready for \u201chis big number.\u201d Confused, she enters the ballroom and to her surprise Robert, in a snazzy and bedazzled tuxedo, starts singing \u201cComin\u2019 Home Baby,\u201d complete with dancers and backup singers.",
      "It becomes a whole production when Maxine, in a bright yellow two-piece ensemble, gets on the table and starts to perform her own dance routine. The performance, Sylvia tells TODAY, is the \u201cmusical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted to start with a bang. I\u2019m such a huge fan of movie musicals. I started as a dancer myself, and so I brought a whole book full of inspirations to the designers and brought in the choreographer,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mash up of a lot of my personal influences, and I was just so grateful that everybody brought their A-game and that we were able to make the musical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "Shot in one day from beginning to end in a single take, he says, the dancers rehearsed for about three days while the costumes took weeks. They also built the set from scratch.",
      "However, as the performance continues, Robert is shot and begins to bleed. Maxine, still on top of the table, is dragged away from Robert as flashbacks of the Season 1 finale when he was shot appear on screen. The musical number continues and ends with Robert on the floor.",
      "It turns out Maxine was hallucinating and admitted into mental institute Sunny Tides. They have drugged her and she keeps asking for Robert.",
      "Robert is then seen unconscious in a hospital bed with Norma (Carol Burnett) by his side asking how he knew her name. Robert appears to be alive, for now.",
      "As viewers recall, Robert discovered that Norma was really Agnes and stole her identity. This was after Norma asked Robert to marry her so that he could inherit all her wealth.",
      "In the second season's first episode, Norma begins to put the pieces together.",
      "But will Robert survive and be a threat to Norma?",
      "In one scene, Maxine escapes Sunny Tides and visits Robert at the hospital. She hides underneath the hospital bed as Norma walks in and the doctor tells her that Robert is \u201ctouch and go,\u201d leaning on go. If he does wake up, the doctor says, his speech will be their first sign of hope and from there they will assess for any brain damage.",
      "After the doctor leaves, Norma talks to an unconscious Robert and tells him, \u201cI know who told you about Agnes.\u201d",
      "By the end of the episode, Robert opens his eyes and simply says, \u201cAgnes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I read the last episode last season and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, am I dying?\u2019 and then Abe told me, \u2018Oh, Ricky, I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you, you\u2019re not going to die,\u2019\u201d Martin tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I am open to anything.\u201d",
      "Kristen Wiig adds that \u201cit\u2019s been hard to keep\u201d Robert\u2019s fate a secret, \u201cbecause people have seen photos. So it\u2019s been really hard for us to be like, \u2018Is he a ghost?\u2019\u201d",
      "But as viewers know, if anyone gets in Norma's way, their future could be up in the air.",
      "Sylvia notes that this season he played with different genres, including the theme of \u201860s \u201cbitty horror movies.\u201d He cites \u201cWhatever Happened to Baby Jane\u201d and \u201cHush\u2026 Hush, Sweet Charlotte\u201c as inspiration.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to bring an element of that to us. Even though the show is ostensibly a comedy, we want people on the edge of their seat and have this element of thriller to it,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd as you make your way through the season, that just keeps building and building and building.\u201d",
      "As for Martin and Wiig, they joke that \u201ca fake death every season\u201d would be \u201cfunny.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou haven\u2019t gotten to 10, so who knows what happens,\u201d quips Wiig, with Martin adding, \u201cYou have to see Episode 10.\u201d",
      "New episodes of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d premiere weekly on Wednesdays on Apple TV+."

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not every day a new television series boasts a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the new Apple TV sci-fi drama \u201cPluribus\u201d is earning raves from critics and fans alike.",
      "The series, whose first two episodes premiered on Nov. 7, tells the story of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), a grumpy romance-fantasy author who finds herself among the dozen or so people tasked with saving the world after an alien virus puts everyone else into a happy hive mind.",
      "\u201cPluribus\u201d was created by Vince Gilligan, the mastermind behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d His new series grapples with questions about humanity, technology and contentment: If the creepy hive mind \u2014 like Aldous Huxley\u2019s fictional soma drug in the classic dystopian novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d \u2014 makes everyone happier, maybe it\u2019s OK?",
      "Seehorn, a familiar face to Gilligan fans thanks to her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d brings her comic sensibilities to Carol, whose misanthropic nature makes her an odd candidate to save humanity.",
      "Gilligan sets the series in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same setting as \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Those fascinated by UFO folklore also know the general area as the home of the 1947 Roswell Incident.",
      "Read on to hear what critics and viewers have said so far about \u201cPluribus.\u201d",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Since it debuted on Nov. 7, critics have raved about \u201cPluribus\u201d with many celebrating the continued collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn.",
      "The show currently has a critic's rating of 100%.",
      "Linda Holmes of NPR called the show a \u201cbrutal watch\u201d at times, noting how \u201cCarol finds herself deep in grief, walking through empty buildings, driving deserted neighborhoods, experiencing the arid desolation of a frictionless life.",
      "\u201cBut the collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn,\u201d Holmes continues, \u201calso is built on how funny she is, how perfectly suited to both his willingness to plumb deep wells of sadness and the playfulness.\u201d",
      "Joel Keller of Decider agreed the show\u2019s heaviness is offset by its playful tone, writing, \u201c\u2018Pluribus\u2019 is creepy and tension-filled and funny and dramatic and really weird.\u201d",
      "While several critics noted the pacing of \u201cPluribus\u201d can be slow at times, most, like Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd, promised the show ultimately delivers.",
      "\u201cAfter quickly establishing the premise, Gilligan shifts into low gear; this is a slow series, yet never a boring one,\u201d writes Lloyd, adding, \u201cGreat tracts of time pass without dialogue. For most of the way it\u2019s Seehorn\u2019s show, and she\u2019s marvelous \u2014 running through a range of emotions, confused, clever, resigned and determined by turns, as she navigates (as they say in the comics) a world she never made, an angry person beating against a sea of contentment, a complicated person in a one-speed society.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Quah of Vulture also urged viewers to stick with the series, writing, \u201cYou owe it to yourself to give \u2018Pluribus\u2019 a chance. Something glorious is gestating inside this entrancing piece of television, and to experience its full effect, you have to trust the process.\u201d",
      "Chase Hutchinson of the Seattle Times praised the series for asking challenging questions.",
      "\u201cThe more it goes on, the more \u2018Pluribus\u2019 becomes a show of immense, urgent feeling, one that grapples with the terrors of growing numb to loss. It\u2019s about survival versus resistance, compliance versus conflict, fantasy versus reality, and whether a false happiness is worth losing all of who you were for.",
      "\u201cCarol is a bit of a grump,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut she\u2019s our grump, a graceful sliver of humanity\u2019s complexity in a world that\u2019s seeking to flatten it.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes have also been mostly glowing. The show currently boasts an 84% rating from audiences at home.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan is the greatest TV writer/show runner of the Gen X cohort. The pilot is original, riveting, mysterious, funny and tragic, all at the same time. I cannot remember being so engaged in a story, at least since his last masterpiece, \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019\u201d wrote one.",
      "\u201cI was hooked from the beginning. Kept up the pace. Kept up the excitement so far threw (sic) the first 2 episodes ... The acting is superb! Finally something exciting to watch! Thank you,\u201d another agreed.",
      "Not all viewers were happy with \u201cPluribus.\u201d A handful said they were disappointed by the show and confused by all its glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cI went in knowing nothing about this show plus I\u2019m a massive sci-fi fan but I just don\u2019t understand the hype here,\u201d wrote one in part, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like people\u2019s body were taken over and forced to give 5 stars.\u201d"

      "\u201cI think like a lot of marriages that go through hard things, where one partner has been basically awful to the other, it\u2019s not so easy to just walk away from a 20-year relationship that is based on love,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope what we\u2019ve built, between Kristen and Josh\u2019s characters, a complicated relationship that people can actually really relate to.\u201d",

A fun challenge for him. But, I think he totally loves her.\u201d",

It really devastated me to have to leave things like that between Maxine and Mitzi,\u201d she says, adding that Mitzi really loved Maxine in her own way.",
      "The actor and model said it \u201cbroke her heart to see these two people who we see really caring about each other and trying to lift each other up ... and you see them hurting each other.

      "In episode eight, he says, Axel asks Norma why she ghosted him and that she became \u201ca completely different person.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything really has for the last three episodes been leading up to this revelation that only Robert has put together because of the intimate knowledge he has of Norma and her diabetes,\u201d Sylvia explains.",
      "\u201cSo when Axl says, \u2018Yes, Agnes, she was a diabetic, they didn\u2019t live long back in those days. At least not without a lot of money.\u2019 I think Robert isn\u2019t completely sure of himself until he says \u2018Agnes\u2019 to Norma. She says, \u2018Why did you call me that?\u2019 and then, \u2018Oh my gosh, that secret might die with Robert.\u2019\u201d",
      "Sylvia noted the ironies of Norma\u2019s secret because throughout the entire season, Maxine has been trying to fit in and feels like an imposter.",
      "\u201cBut Norma is the biggest impostor of all,\u201d he says.",
      "Why Didn\u2019t Virginia Get Arrested By the Cops?",

      "Robinson tells TODAY.com that Virginia has worked very hard to be where she is.\u201d",

    "summary": "Social media users are calling out Shay Mitchell for Rini, a kids' skin care brand. A dermatologist weighs in.",
    "story": [
      "Shay Mitchell and Esther Song just launched a new skin care line for kids, sparking conversations about the necessity of the products for children.",
      "The duo launched their new brand, Rini, which means \"children\" in Korean, on Nov. 6. Rini\u2019s launch consisted of \"everyday\" face masks in the shape of a puppy, unicorn or panda, a hydrating hydrogel facial mask and an after-sun hydrogel facial mask. The facial sheets contain ingredients like vitamin E, vitamin B12 and aloe vera.",
      "Mitchell and Song say the products are intended \"to nurture healthy habits, spark confidence, and make thoughtfully crafted daily care essentials and play products accessible to every family.\"  The co-founders also claim that the brands' products are safe for toddlers as young as 3 years old.",
      "But the launch was met with some backlash online, with some claiming the products aren't needed for children's skin and project beauty standards onto kids.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to representatives for Mitchell and Rini for comment.",
      "What are consumers saying about the brand's launch and what do dermatologists think? We're breaking it all down below.",
      "What Is Rini?",
      "Shay Mitchell first teased her new company Rini on Instagram Nov. 5 by posting a photo of a child using a face mask. The company formally launched the next day.",
      "\"This has been three years in the making, inspired by my girls, their curiosity, and all the little moments that made me realize how early it starts. From birthday parties and face paint to wanting to do 'what mommy does' with her face masks\u2026 it was only a matter of time,\" Mitchell wrote on Instagram.",
      "Mitchell explained that she and her close friend and business partner Song specifically came up with the idea for the aloe vera recovery mask when they saw Song's daughter\u2019s skin after a day in the sun.",
      "\u201cI wanted something that worked, but was still clean enough for my kids and now it\u2019s finally here,\u201d Mitchell, who is a mom to 6-year-old Atlas and 3-year-old Rome, said. \u201cKids are naturally curious and instead of ignoring that, we can embrace it. With safe, gentle products parents can trust, and sweet moments that bring us closer.\u201d",
      "On Rini's website, they added that they \"created Rini because we wanted products that are gentle, trust-worthy, and inspire creativity.\"",
      "In a promotional video for Rini, Mitchell opened up about the experience of her own daughters wanting face masks that she thought were inappropriate.",
      "\"The ingredients in these masks are crazy. They actually shouldn\u2019t be used for kids at all,\" she said.",
      "A press release for the launch said that Rini's formulas were developed with pediatric chemists and labs in South Korea and the brand\u2019s \u201cproprietary formulas reflect the brand\u2019s \u2018rini promise\u2019 of transparency, safety, and quality to redefine play for Little Faces with Big Imaginations.\u201d",
      "The brand claims that its products are dermatologist-tested, EU-complaint, hypoallergenic, vegan and cruelty free.",
      "Why Rini Has Sparked Some Backlash",
      "Before the company formally launched on Nov. 6, Rini \u2014 and the imagery of a young girl using a face mask \u2014\u00a0sparked controversy.",
      "\"This feels beyond GRIM,\" one person commented on the Nov. 5 post.",
      "\"I\u2019m deeply disappointed. Why are we projecting beauty standards onto children now,\" another wrote.",
      "Other commenters expressed their concerns over the marketing of skin care toward young kids.",
      "\"Their skin needs recovery from what?\" one Instagram user said.",
      "\"The only face product a child needs is sunscreen, this is wild!\" another added.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m genuinely concerned by this. kids don\u2019t need hydrogel masks or actives. their skin barrier is already healthy and still developing. this kind of \u2018early skincare\u2019 marketing really blurs the line between care and consumerism. do better,\" a third wrote.",
      "Representatives for Mitchell did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment by the time of publication.",
      "The Brand's Launch Is Part of a Growing Trend of Young 'Skinfluencers'",
      "In a segment that aired on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk explored the rising trend of Gen Alpha's newfound passion for skin care.",
      "Many young \"skinfluencers\" have emerged on social media and built large followings by filming videos about their skin care routines and product faves.",
      "Naiya, an 11-year-old skinfluencer on TikTok, spoke to TODAY and said she's \"learned a lot about skin care and makeup\" by filming TikTok videos.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve learned how to have a lot of fun with my mom,\u201d she said.",
      "Naiya's mother, Ashley Paige, encourages other parents to support their children's interest in skin care and start healthy routines together.",
      "\"If your children are old enough to be curious about it, it\u2019s time to have a conversation,\" she said.",
      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked  Dermatologists",
      "TODAY.com spoke with two dermatologists to get their thoughts on the rising trend of child skin care. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Rini\u2019s website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids\u2019 skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \u201ceveryday\u201d mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, tells TODAY.com that kids \u201cdon\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\u201d",
      "That's because the derm says kids\u2019 skin is typically balanced on its own and \u201cnot problematic.\u201d",
      "Fahs says kids\u2019 skin \u201cneeds very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\u201d she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it\u2019s not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids\u2019 skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \u201ccreated for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\u201c and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand\u2019s product pages.",
      "Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a board-certified dermatologist, says parents don't need to rush their children into a skin care routine.",
      "\"At age 3, the only thing I think we should be considering is getting them into a little habit of being clean and just (hygienic),\" she says, adding that masks and scrubs aren't necessary for young children.",
      "Per Ingleton, children don't need to use preventative skin care products until the onset of puberty.",
      "\"Wait until there is an issue when their skin actually changes.  Then you are targeting their skin with specific products,\" she says.",
      "Fahs seconds that sentiment and advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d",
      "During a live segment on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk said the dermatologists she spoke to suggested avoiding skin care products with harsh ingredients, including retinol, fragrance and artificial dyes. They also suggested steering clear of scrubs, which can irritate skin.",
      "The dermatologists Gosk spoke to recommended seeking out products that say they're dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, calming and gentle. Ingredients like oatmeal, aloe vera and chamomile are good.",
      "\"But again, it is a conversation with your kids about what they actually need. And remember that they are going to see this stuff, so you do have to talk about it probably,\" she said."

      "\u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d stars Michael Chernus as John Wayne Gacy, Gabriel Luna as detective Rafael Tovar and Marin Ireland as Elizabeth Piest, the mother of Gacy\u2019s final victim, Robert Piest.",

      "\"There isn't graphic violence shown. There's no murder shown on camera... That was one of the ways that helped me get into playing this character, was knowing that it was going to be this different point of view.\"",
      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story of John Wayne Gacy, who he was, how he was caught and what happened to him.",
      "Who Was John Wayne Gacy?",
      "Born in 1942 in Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was a building contractor who also dressed as \"Pogo the Clown\" for children's parties.",
      "According to History.com, he had a relatively normal middle-class upbringing, though there were accounts that he had an abusive alcoholic father. He got married in 1964 to Marlynn Myers, whose father owned a couple of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Waterloo, Iowa. As seen in \"Devil in Disguise,\" Gacy managed one of the restaurants. He was later charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting one of his male employees in 1968. He was released early due to good behavior.",
      "Gacy and Myers had two children together, Michael and Christine, before they divorced following his charges.",
      "After his release, he moved back to Chicago and remarried Carole Hoff. Once there, he started his construction business and clown work.",
      "What Did John Wayne Gacy Do?",
      "From 1972 to 1978, Gacy lured young men and boys, oftentimes for sex before murdering them and burying them in his home's crawl space.",
      "His murders would go undetected for years until December 1978 when police started investigating the disappearance of 15-year-old teenager named Robert Piest.",
      "How Did John Wayne Gacy Get Caught?",
      "Robert Piest was last seen with Gacy. \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d shows how he would lure young men with hopes of a construction job, taking him to his home before he killed them.",
      "Piest went missing on his mother Elizabeth Piest's birthday, when he never returned home for dinner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Elizabeth, which is good for the Piest family, which I think really valued their privacy,\u201d Ireland tells TODAY.com about portraying the victim\u2019s mother. \u201cFor me, I focused on just telling a story of a woman who was going through this very sudden and intense grief.\u201d",
      "Police began to look into Gacy after learning of his prior conviction. After obtaining a search warrant for his Norwood Park home, they discovered a foul smell and items from other missing men.",
      "According to NBC Chicago, Gacy's then-lawyer Sam Amirante shared in his book \u201cJohn Wayne Gacy: Defending a Monster,\u201d that Gacy confessed to him that Robert Piest was dead and \u201che\u2019s in the Des Plaines River.\u201d",
      "Gacy would go on to detail each of his murders and where he buried or dumped the bodies.",
      "\u201cHe went on, murder by murder, piece by piece, burial by burial,\u201d Amirante wrote. \u201cHe wanted to prove that what he was saying was true. He wanted to take us to his house and show us the burial ground.\u201d",
      "In 1979, Gacy was arrested in Cook County, Illinois. Police continued to find bodies in Gacy's home, as well as the river where he said he disposed of the victims.",
      "What Happened to John Wayne Gacy?",
      "In March of 1980, Gacy was convicted of murdering 33 young men, who ranged from 14 to 21. He was sentenced to death and transferred to death row in the then-new downstate Menard Correctional Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "More victims continued to be identified as the months and years went by. In 1985, an appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding Gacy's death sentence.",
      "Gacy was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center in 1994.",
      "Five of his victims recovered from his residence remain unidentified. According to the Cooks County Sheriff\u2019s Department, officials tested the remains using the latest technology and DNA profiles suitable for comparison have been obtained.",
      "\u201cI really hope that (with this show) we can start to talk about changing the narrative around dehumanizing people who aren\u2019t like ourselves,\u201d Chernus says. \u201cI really think we are trying to, in a way, address the systemic biases that allowed Gacy to get away with this for so long. And there are still unidentified victims that I hope, in some way, maybe this show allows someone to call in a tip.\u201d",
      "The PD stated that after Gacy\u2019s arrest, they learned that some of his victims were never reported missing by their families. At the time, many were estranged from the victims or were unaware that they were missing.",
      "The department is still accepting information from people who believe their friends or family members might have been one of Gacy\u2019s victims."

      "\u201cIt is our longstanding policy to not comment on intelligence matters,\u201d the Downing Street spokesperson said in an email. \u201cThe U.S. is our closest ally on security and intelligence. We continue to work together to uphold global peace and security, defend freedom of navigation, and respond to emerging threats.\u201d",
      "CNN first reported the suspension of intelligence sharing on narcotics trafficking vessels in Latin America.",
      "The CIA declined to comment. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",

      "Britain, France and the Netherlands have territories in the Caribbean and have long worked with the United States and other regional governments to try to stem narcotics trafficking. In the past decade, cocaine smuggling to Europe from South America via the Caribbean has spiked, according to government reports and experts.",

      "On the legality of the strikes, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told reporters Tuesday: \u201cDecisions on this are a matter for the U.S. Issues around whether or not anything is against international law is a matter for a competent international court, not for governments to determine.\u201d",

The US must halt such attacks and take all measures necessary to prevent the extrajudicial killing of people aboard these boats, whatever the criminal conduct alleged against them,\u201d Turk said in a statement.",
      "The Trump administration, however, maintains that drug cartels pose a threat to America\u2019s national security by transporting narcotics to the United States that claim tens of thousands of lives each year. The administration has labeled multiple cartels from Venezuela, Mexico and elsewhere as foreign terrorist organizations.",
      "The strikes, which began in early September, have killed at least 75 people, according to numbers announced by the Pentagon.",
      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Tuesday ordered his country\u2019s security forces to stop sharing intelligence with Washington until the Trump administration halted the strikes on suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean.",
      "In a post on X, Petro wrote that Colombia\u2019s military must immediately end \u201ccommunications and other agreements with U.S. security agencies.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has portrayed Petro as failing to crack down on narco-traffickers and criticized his decision not to extradite Colombian rebel leaders involved in the drug trade to the United States."

      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",

      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",
      "In Norway, Ruter, the electric bus operator, said it had carried out several fixes, including stricter controls on future bus purchases, \u201cfirewalls\u201d to protect against hackers, and \u201ccollaborating with national and local authorities on clear cybersecurity requirements.\u201d",
      "Are experts convinced this will work?",

      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s been a strange sort of prison break: no daring escapes, no Hollywood getaways \u2014 just inmates quietly released, by mistake, onto the streets of Britain.",
      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "Under international pressure, the RSF said Thursday that it was willing to engage in a U.S.-brokered humanitarian ceasefire. But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",
      "While talks are ongoing, eyewitness accounts, videos shared to social media and an analysis of satellite imagery that has shown pools of blood visible from space have revealed the scale of the killing in the region and the increasing use of drone strikes by both sides as they seek to gain an advantage on the battlefield.",
      "Hanaa Abdullah Musa said RSF fighters detained her brother at one of several checkpoints she came across as she made her way to Tawila, which is home to hundreds of thousands of displaced people.",
      "\u201cThey drove him to some place,\u201d she told NBC News in a voice note on Thursday. \u201cLater in the evening, they told us they would bring him back, but they never did.\u201d",

    "summary": "A flu strain that emerged over the summer is causing outbreaks in other countries. The CDC hasn't provided any insights on what's happening in the U.S. in weeks.",
    "story": [
      "As flu season gets underway, global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the virus that popped up in June \u2014 four months after the makeup of this year\u2019s flu shots had been decided.",
      "The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are warning about the early wave that\u2019s sending people to the hospital.",
      "\u201cSince it emerged, it\u2019s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.",
      "The version of H3N2 that\u2019s circulated worldwide this year \u201cacquired 7 new mutations over the summer,\u201d Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases at Scotland\u2019s University of Glasgow, said in a media statement. That \u201cmeans the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year\u2019s vaccine,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.K. is heading \u201cinto what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,\u201d the head of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, James Mackey, said last week.",
      "It\u2019s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "KYIV \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s justice minister was suspended Wednesday in an investigation into a $100 million kickback scandal in the country\u2019s energy sector that has fueled public anger and reached the heart of the country's wartime leadership.",
      "German Galushchenko was removed from office one day after anti-corruption authorities said they exposed a scheme that allegedly involves a close associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and an ex-deputy prime minister nicknamed \u201cChe Guevara.\u201d",
      "The probe threatened a high-profile confrontation over the long-running issue of graft in Ukraine as it battles to maintain Western support for its fight against Russia, which has battered its neighbor's energy infrastructure with waves of attacks.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram on Wednesday that those involved \"cannot remain in their positions,\" adding: \"This is a matter of trust in particular. If there are accusations, they must be answered.\"",
      "Five people have been arrested and another seven were placed under suspicion, according to a statement Tuesday from Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau, the NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, SAPO.",
      "The \u201chigh-level criminal organization\u201d saw current and former officials, and businesspeople, allegedly receive benefits and launder money through the country\u2019s state energy company, Energoatom, authorities said.",
      "Among those accused of involvement is Timur Mindich, a businessman with ties to Zelenskyy, SAPO prosecutor Serhiy Savytskyi told a court hearing Tuesday.",
      "Savytskyi said Mindich's \"criminal activity in the energy sector was established by him influencing\" Galushchenko, the justice minister who until July served as energy secretary.",
      "Mindich is co-owner of the television production company Kvartal 95, which was founded by Zelenskyy when he was an actor and comedian before becoming president. In a statement, the studio distanced itself from the allegations, saying that Mindich \u201cdoes not participate in\u201d the company\u2019s \u201cactivities and does not influence the content or decisions of the team.\u201d",
      "Galushchenko, who has not been arrested, said in a statement that he agreed with the government\u2019s decision to suspend him \u201cfor the duration of the investigation\u201d and called it a \u201ccivilized and appropriate scenario.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will defend myself in the legal arena and prove my position,\u201d he added.",
      "His suspension was announced in a statement by Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, who did not provide details of what exactly he had been accused of, or his alleged role in the wider scheme.",
      "In a separate statement, the NABU said this \u201ccriminal organization transferred funds to an unnamed former deputy prime minister of Ukraine, referred to internally as Che Guevara.\u201d",
      "Detectives said they found some $1.2 million transferred to this person, the last $500,000 of which was sent to his wife after he came under investigation, it said.",
      "According to the NABU and SAPO, the corruption scheme involved forcing Energoatom\u2019s contractors to pay an illegal commission of 10%-15% or risk losing their supplier status.",
      "\u201cUsing their official connections in the ministry and the state-owned company,\u201d the suspects \u201censured control over personnel decisions, procurement processes, and financial flows,\u201d the anti-corruption agencies said in a statement.",
      "Zeleneksyy said in an earlier statement Monday that, \"there must be convictions\" for anyone found guilty of corruption, and that government officials \"must work together with\" anti-corruption agencies.",
      "In the summer, Zelenskyy was met with international criticism and rare public protests after raids against a high-profile anti-corruption campaigner and a parliamentary bill, later withdrawn, that would have curbed the powers of anti-corruption agencies.",
      "Energoatom said in a statement Tuesday that the saga had not impacted its financial health or operational safety.",
      "\"Energoatom has been and remains the pillar of Ukraine\u2019s energy system; together with our partners, we ensure the reliable operation of nuclear power facilities and uninterrupted supply of electricity for Ukraine\u2019s needs,\" it said.",
      "Ukraine has made strides on fighting its endemic corruption problem, particularly since Zelenskyy made it a central plank of his 2019 election manifesto. But the country still struggles with the issue at high levels of government and business.",
      "In a report last week, the European Commission praised Ukraine\u2019s attempts to tackle corruption during wartime, but warned that its \u201climited progress\u201d was jeopardizing its long-term hopes to join the European Union.",
      "Reports of growing state pressure on anti-corruption groups \u201ccast doubts on Ukraine\u2019s commitment to its anticorruption agenda,\u201d it said, while cautioning that Ukraine should \u201cprevent any backsliding on its notable reform achievements.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 President Donald Trump has said he has an obligation to proceed with his threatened $1 billion lawsuit against the BBC for editing a speech he made before his supporters' violent Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the presidential election result.",
      "The BBC's top executive, Director-General Tim Davie, and its news CEO, Deborah Turness, resigned Sunday amid a growing scandal over this and other alleged editorial misjudgments.",
      "Trump celebrated the news, though his legal team also wrote to the corporation on Sunday demanding a \u201cfull and fair retraction\u201d and gave a deadline of 5 p.m. Friday for a response. A BBC spokesperson said: \"We will review the letter and respond directly in due course.\"",
      "The issue has become a major story in the U.K. where Prime Minister Keir Starmer told lawmakers at the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session in parliament on Wednesday: \"I believe in a strong and independent BBC. Some would rather the BBC didn't exist ... I'm not one of them.\"",
      "He added, however, that \"where mistakes are made they do need to get their house in order.\"",
      "Starmer was responding to Ed Davey, the leader of the Liberal Democrat party, who asked whether the government would urge the BBC to fight Trump's lawsuit.",
      "Davey said \"a great British institution is under attack from a foreign government ... Trump has underlined press freedom in America and now he's trying to do the same here.\"",
      "Asked Tuesday night whether he would sue, Trump told Fox News: \"Well, I guess I have to you know, why not? Because they defrauded the public, and they've admitted it.\"",
      "\"I think I have an obligation to do it, because you can't get people, you can't allow people to do that,\" he said, before comparing the action to his lawsuit against CBS for a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his then-presidential election rival Kamala Harris. CBS paid $16 million to settle the case.",
      "Trump complained that the BBC's edit of his speech \"made it sound radical\" when it was \"a very calming speech.\"",
      "The saga centers on a \"Panorama\" documentary that aired before last year's election.",
      "In it, two parts of the speech were edited together to give the impression that Trump said:  \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol... and I'll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.\"",
      "In fact Trump initially said: \"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\"",
      "He said later: \"And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"",
      "The House Jan. 6 committee said after an 18-month investigation that Trump spent much of the speech at the Washington rally \u201camping up his crowd with lies about the election, attacking his own vice-president and Republican members of Congress, and exhorting the crowd to fight.\u201d",
      "BBC Chairman Samir Shah has apologized for what he called an \"error of judgement\" as the furor intensifies the debate over the embattled broadcaster\u2019s future.",
      "Davie told staff in a 40-minute all-hands meeting Tuesday that despite mistakes the corporation had to \u201cfight for our journalism,\u201d BBC News reported.",
      "Trump also told Fox News he took offense at this coming from \"one of our great allies,\" meaning the United Kingdom.",
      "The BBC is a public corporation funded by a national license fee of 174.50 pound ($228) per household, but it is editorially independent and frequently runs critical and revealing news stories about the government of the day.",
      "The incident and other claims of biased reporting have provided potent fuel for conservative critics of the BBC, including many lawmakers and right-wing newspapers who oppose the license fee and accuse the corporation of being culturally liberal and institutionally biased.",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy told Parliament Tuesday that the BBC is a \"national institution\" and warned against a sustained attack. The ten-year charter that governs the BBC, including its funding, is due for renewal in 2027."

      "Used on an almost nightly basis in the war in Ukraine, a spate of mysterious drone incursions above airports and sensitive sites has also highlighted Europe\u2019s vulnerability to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and sparked alarm that NATO nations are unprepared to defend themselves from the cheap but effective weaponry.",

      "Moreno wanted to encourage Trump to take a more targeted approach \u2014 directly aimed at Petro. To do so, the senator brought along a document titled \u201cThe Trump Doctrine For Colombia and the Western Hemisphere.\u201d In addition to five policy ideas, the one-page outline featured large images of Petro and Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the president of Venezuela, in orange prison jumpsuits. The images appear to be generated by artificial intelligence. NBC News obtained the memo from a person familiar with the episode.",
      "Now that document is at the center of an even further strain in diplomatic relationships between Colombia and the U.S.",

      "Moreno\u2019s memo called for the president to designate more cartels as foreign terrorist organizations; target Petro, his family and associates for further sanctions; and launch an investigation into Petro\u2019s campaign finances, among other measures. The proposal did not include advocacy for new Colombian tariffs or the cutting off of aid to the country. It also did not call for the U.S. to engage in a regime-change effort.",

      "Trump has yet to announce new tariffs on Colombia. And CNN reported last week that there has been no interruption yet to U.S. assistance to the country.",
      "Petro, a socialist, accused the U.S. of killing a fisherman last month in one of its attacks on a boat the U.S. claimed was involved in drug smuggling. The U.S. revoked Petro\u2019s visa during the United Nations General Assembly in September after the Colombian leader spoke at a pro-Palestinian rally in New York and called for U.S. soldiers to resist Trump.",

    "story": [
      "A cyberattack against British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the country\u2019s largest automaker, has been so catastrophic that it put a dent in the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, the Bank of England said.",
      "In its quarterly monetary policy report, released Thursday, the Bank of England said headline GDP had grown by 0.2%, less than it had projected. That slowdown was due to reduced exports to the U.S. and \u201cdisruption linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack,\u201d it said.",
      "The hack against Jaguar Land Rover, which began in August, has proven to be the most economically devastating in British history, said Ciaran Martin, the chair of the technical committee at Cyber Monitoring Centre, a nonprofit that tracks the impacts of cyberattacks on the country.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

    "story": [
      "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency announced Monday. It\u2019s the first country in the Americas to do so since the pandemic, and it could serve as a warning sign for others.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including declines in vaccination rates. The most significant factor is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada\u2019s outbreak started in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Monday, Canada\u2019s health officials had tallied 5,138 measles cases since the outbreak began. Two babies, infected in utero, were born pre-term and died.",
      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",
      "The spread of measles in the Americas is not limited to Canada. As of last week, PAHO officials reported that there\u2019ve been 12,593 confirmed measles cases across the entire region, which encompasses North, Central and South America \u2014 30 times the number reported last year.",
      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",
      "In the U.S., an outbreak that began in January continues to spread across the country.",
      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",
      "The outbreaks have occurred as vaccination rates have declined steadily in the U.S.",
      "A monthslong NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. Two are recommended.",
      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",
      "The panel met last week in Mexico City to analyze the latest measles data submitted from countries with active outbreaks through October.",
      "A PAHO spokesman said the group could not confirm whether its independent committee will meet again in January to discuss measles spread in the U.S."

      "The official award Monday drew outrage from rights activists who accuse the country\u2019s current leader, President Prabowo Subianto, of whitewashing his former father-in-law\u2019s legacy.",
      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The annual award is given to those who have contributed significantly to the development of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago and former Dutch colony that declared independence in 1945.",
      "\u201cA prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,\u201d an announcer said as Prabowo gave the award to Suharto\u2019s daughter and son.",
      "Suharto, a military officer, became president in 1967 after seizing power from Indonesia\u2019s first president and independence leader, Sukarno, who was viewed as pro-communist by Western governments.",
      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",
      "\u201cThere has for some time been a tendency in official circles to rehabilitate Suharto\u201d and to see his regime \u201cin a progressively more positive light,\u201d he said.",
      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",
      "Protesters also gathered in Jakarta last week to oppose giving Suharto the national hero title.",
      "Prabowo, who was formerly married to Suharto\u2019s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, also has a military background. He has denied accusations of human rights violations in East Timor, where he led a special forces unit in the 1980s, and in Papua.",
      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",
      "He was later banned from traveling to the U.S. until 2020, when he became defense minister. He became president last year.",
      "Even after Suharto\u2019s death, his family\u2019s legacy remains deeply entrenched in Indonesian politics. His political party, Golkar, is still a formidable force and backed Prabowo\u2019s presidential bid last year."

      "The Oval Office is a long way from Abu Ghraib.",
      "When he was greeted by President Donald Trump on Monday, Ahmad al-Sharaa completed his journey from jihadist leader to head of state receiving a warm White House welcome.",
      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."

      "A Pentagon spokesperson told NBC News on Friday that the list \u201cwas created weeks ago, when the U.S. Army was concerned that its German employees might not be getting paid\u201d during the shutdown.",
      "Soldiers and U.S. civilian employees \u201chave access to several support programs on their bases,\u201d the spokesperson added. Soldiers \u201cdid in fact get paid at the end of October,\u201d a spokesman for U.S. Army Europe and Africa told NBC News.",
      "The German government stepped in to pay the salaries of nearly 11,000 civilians who work on U.S. military bases, the nation\u2019s finance ministry said in a statement. It is counting on being repaid once the shutdown ends, a spokesperson said.",
      "While some governments have stepped in to foot the bill, others have not done so, with employees in Italy and Portugal working unpaid as the gridlock in Washington drags on.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an absurd situation because nobody has responses, nobody feels responsible,\u201d said Angelo Zaccaria, a union coordinator at the Aviano Air Base in northeastern Italy.",
      "\u201cThis is having dramatic effects on us Italian workers,\u201d he told The Associated Press.",
      "How local employees are paid varies by country and is based on specific agreements the U.S. government has with each host nation, said Amber Kelly-Herard, a public affairs spokesperson for the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa.",
      "During the shutdown, Kelly-Herard said, local employees were expected to continue to perform their jobs in accordance with their work contracts.",
      "A Pentagon spokesperson said: \u201cWe value the important contributions of our local national employees around the world.\u201d",
      "Linda Bilmes, a professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and an expert on public finance, said locals working as contractors at U.S. military bases are generally most at risk of losing pay.",
      "She added that the U.S. government in the past always paid back full-time employees \u2014 but that contractors are not always covered, which is why some add extra fees in their contracts to cover potential government funding stoppages.",
      "\u201cI doubt anyone anticipated this length of delay,\u201d Bilmes said."
