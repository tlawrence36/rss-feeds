Fans of the bands are also wondering which guests might join the living members of Bad Company and Soundgarden on stage.",

      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",

I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake?

      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",

      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "The report is the 20th edition of the annual tracking by GLAAD and charts a remarkable leap from just 47 LGBTQ+ characters in the first study.

      "France's court of auditors has urged the Louvre museum to prioritize security modernization",
      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

      "The court of auditors, which is an independent body, recommended that the Louvre focuses on priorities including bringing the museum\u2019s technical facilities, particularly safety and security, up to standards, and cut its expenses in other areas. That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to.

      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",

      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort. They sing a strange, sensual love song in a band and they\u2019re shy that their parents will hear it. Or you write a book that\u2019s transgressive. I'm the opposite. I\u2019m rather proud that I've done personal films because my kids will see them. Maybe they\u2019ll see them and think they\u2019re stupid or my opinions are weird. That\u2019s OK, but they were me. I think this film came out of a climate in my life when I was thinking about these things.",
      "TRIER: That was when I knew I had the film I wanted to make, when I had the idea of ending. We were all nervous about it. The last day of the shoot. I\u2019m so proud of you two. My dream came true.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019m glad that you say I have a rhythm because I really care about rhythm. Scenes are to me like music pieces. He wrote this for me and the (expletive) and he\u2019s seen what I\u2019ve been longing for: the acting between the lines. (Skarsg\u00e5rd begins tearing up.) I\u2019m getting emotional.",
      "TRIER: I think you are incredibly smart with screenwriting, so much so that I was nervous going in. You\u2019re very blunt in a very warm way. You say \u201c(Expletive) this\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need this.\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: It's being allowed to do a film that\u2019s not written in a head of a director. He\u2019s exploring it. There\u2019s nothing like it. (Again Skarsg\u00e5rd gets emotional before shaking his head.) Enough!",
      "REINSVE: This is it. I feel this moment is it. It brings to the surface something we're longing for. The human mind needs to create a narrative and make things black or white to protect itself. That\u2019s a problem in the world, being so polarized. The wisdom is being safe enough to create a space to let anything happen and see the nuances between people. There are no sets like Joachim\u2019s sets. It's a process \u2014 what is it? Art creates life, imitates\u2026",
      "SKARSGARD: You never get it right.",

      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",

After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual. I know movies are a different medium from books and that what makes a book good is not the same as what makes a movie good. And so what we\u2019ve ended up with in \u201cNuremberg,\u201d I think, is a movie that is mostly factual, and more important, delivers the messages that are very close to the messages in my book.",
      "Douglas Kelley\u2019s message was that Nazism, fascism, or whatever you want to call it, has always had the potential for coming alive in our country. He saw it immediately when he came back from Europe, and it\u2019s certainly easier to find now.",

      "The seventh \u201cPredator\u201d film takes the franchise to new places by sticking its two stars together",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a long-established cinema subgenre: two opposed people reluctantly stuck together with a common purpose.",
      "The film, the seventh in the franchise (not counting the \u201cAlien vs. Predator\u201d offshoots), has the buddy comedy energy that comes with that dynamic. It also belongs to the narrower subgenre of people quite literally stuck together, like 1958's \u201cThe Defiant Ones,\u201d in which Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis were fugitives united by chains.",
      "And, in a scenario that provided special challenges for stars Elle Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi, \u201cPredator: Badlands\u201d belongs to a still narrower subset it may share only with \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d: movies with a broken android worn like a backpack by a tall and powerful creature as they face peril in a strange corner of space.",
      "\u201cThe real physical inspiration for it was C-3PO strapped to Chewbacca\u2019s back,\u201d director Dan Trachtenberg told The Associated Press in an interview where he was joined by the film's two stars. \u201cBut I think the fun of this is that it\u2019s not Chewbacca. It\u2019s not a friendly, well-intentioned creature, it\u2019s a Predator.\u201d",
      "The apt working title of the movie, which will be released Friday by 20th Century Studios, was \u201cBackpack.\u201d",
      "For much of the New Zealand shoot, Fanning and Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi were every bit as close as they appear to be in the film, where the top half of her artificially intelligent character, Thia, was back-to-back with Schuster-Koloamatangi's young Predator, Dek, who is out to prove himself on a hunt against a seemingly unkillable megamonster.",
      "\u201cHis Predator braids would, like, whip me in the face all the time in our action sequences,\u201d Fanning said with a laugh.",
      "Trachtenberg and the crew used an array of practical ways to make the backpack setup work.",
      "\u201cAny way you can think of making the rig, we tried,\u201d Schuster-Koloamatangi said.",
      "\u201cThrough the mud, through the water, through rivers,\u201d Fanning added.",
      "She said at times her co-star pulled her in a wheelbarrow, and at other times they'd do it on foot.",
      "\u201cI would really pretend to be a backpack swinging around,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d have to coordinate our steps, I\u2019d be walking backward and it would be like, \u2018OK, left, right, left, right.'\u201d",
      "In the scenes when they weren't back-to-back, Trachtenberg wanted them to be genuinely face-to-face.",
      "\u201cWe developed this system where he wore a suit, but his face was open,\u201d the director said. \u201cAnd that way Dimitrius could really be driving the performance, and he and Elle could work off each other in moments, though fleeting, when they were actually facing each other.\u201d",

      "She had more credits by age 5 than her 24-year-old co-star has had yet in his brief career.",

      "The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Recording Academy will announce the 2026 Grammy Award nominees on Friday. It\u2019s as good a reason as any to take a beat and examine how the institution makes it decisions. Who selects the nominees? Who votes? Can anyone nominate any recorded release for a Grammy?",
      "We\u2019ve got you covered. Read on to get a crash course on how Grammy voting works.",
      "Members of the Recording Academy and record labels submit artists in certain categories, which are then vetted for eligibility. Currently, there are 95 Grammy Award categories.",
      "After submissions have been screened, voting members help determine who the final nominations will be \u2014 typically in the fall \u2014 using a membership dashboard. They can only vote for music that has been submitted and vetted.",
      "Once the nominees are determined and announced in November, a period of final round voting takes place. This cycle, that runs from Dec. 12 through Jan. 5.",
      "Winners are announced live at the award show in February.",
      "And don\u2019t get it twisted \u2014 voting members do not vote in all 95 categories. They\u2019re permitted to vote in up to 10 categories across three genre fields, as well as the six general field categories, which include record, album, song, producer, non-classical and songwriter, non-classical of the year, and best new artist. That allows experts to focus on their expertise.",
      "There are three types of Recording Academy memberships: Grammy U, professional and voting memberships. The latter includes performers, songwriters, producers, engineers, instrumentalists and beyond. Those are the members who determine Grammy winners each year.",
      "Voting members have to provide a proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations and certain verifiable credits.",

      "Nov 5, 8:19 AM",
      "But there are a few ways around some of those requirements: If you are a current year\u2019s Grammy winner or nominee, you do not need to provide a recommendation from someone in the industry. If you\u2019ve been nominated for a Grammy in the last five years, you do not need to provide proof of your credits.",
      "Entries must adhere to the specific qualifications of the categories they are submitted into. Rules and guidelines can be found at Grammy.com.",
      "There are also frequent changes made to categories and fields. In 2026, there have been a few: best country album has been divided into best contemporary country album and best traditional country album. The best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories have also been combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.",
      "Most importantly: Recordings and music videos must also be submitted within the Grammy eligibility window, which for the 2026 award show means work released between Aug. 31, 2024 \u2013 Aug. 30, 2025.",
      "The category of new artist is constantly evolving, trying to capture the zeitgeist each year as the process of categorizing fame gets more complicated. The Grammy rules currently say nominations hinge on whether \u201cthe artist had attained a breakthrough or prominence\u201d \u2014 and it delegates that determination to a screening committee. Eligible artists must have released at least five singles or one album, but there is no longer a maximum. That\u2019s why someone like, say, Sabrina Carpenter \u2014 who broke out in the summer of \u201cEspresso\u201d \u2014 found herself up for the best new artist trophy in 2025 despite being on her sixth full-length release.",
      "And this year, the category has also been expanded to include acts who were featured on previous album of the year nominees, so long as they fall below 20% of the album\u2019s music.",
      "The Grammys will be held Feb. 1 at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, with nominations announced on Friday. It will be broadcast live on CBS and can be streamed on demand via Paramount+.",

      "Kristen Stewart has delivered a powerful speech at the Academy Women\u2019s Luncheon, urging women in film to reject tokenism and create their own opportunities",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In a rooftop space filled with Hollywood's most influential figures, actor Kristen Stewart delivered an unflinching speech urging women in film to stay united, reject tokenism and celebrate the next generation of female filmmakers.",
      "Stewart, who directed \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, began her remarks with some humor, but she quickly turned to gender inequity in Hollywood.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s awkward to talk about inequality for some people,\u201d Stewart said Tuesday at the Academy Women\u2019s Luncheon. \u201cWe can discuss wage gaps and taxes on tampons and measure it in lots of quantifiable ways, but the violence of silencing. ... It\u2019s like we\u2019re not even supposed to be angry. But ... I\u2019m so angry.\u201d",
      "Stewart said she was invited to speak about the women who inspire her and began with Yuknavitch, whose memoir she credited with \u201cgiving voice to certain truths I inherently understood.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard truths, when spoken out loud, become springboards to freedom,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThe permission to be unpalatable, unsanitary, and to come from the inside out \u2026 led me to acknowledge the invisible cage that we are all living in and how easy it is to story our way out there.\"",
      "Stewart was the keynote speaker at the event held at the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures with attendees including Tessa Thompson, Kate Hudson, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Claire Foy, Kerry Condon, Patty Jenkins and Emma Mackey.",
      "Many actors in attendance dressed in Chanel clothing, jewelry, shoes, makeup and accessories. The luxury fashion brand, which sponsored the event, has had a long association with film and women creatives since founder Gabrielle \u201cCoco\u201d Chanel saw an opportunity to put her designs in the movies and empower women in film.",
      "While reflecting on the state of women's filmmaking in the post MeToo era, Stewart said it seemed possible that stories made by and for women were finally getting their due.",

      "Helen Garner, an acclaimed Australian writer, has won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for nonfiction",
      "LONDON -- Helen Garner, an acclaimed Australian writer whose celebrity fans include singer Dua Lipa, won the prestigious Baillie Gifford Prize for nonfiction on Tuesday for what judges called her addictive and candid diaries.",
      "Garner, 82, was named winner of the 50,000 pound ($65,000) prize at a ceremony in London for \u201cHow to End a Story.\u201d Journalist Robbie Millen, who chaired the prize jury, said Garner was the unanimous choice of the six judges.",
      "Millen said the judges were captivated by the sharp observation and \u201creckless candor\u201d of Garner\u2019s 800-page book, which covers her life and work between 1978 and 1998.",
      "He said it is \u201ca remarkable, addictive book. Garner takes the diary form, mixing the intimate, the intellectual, and the everyday, to new heights.",
      "\u201cThere are places it\u2019s toe-curlingly embarrassing. She puts it all out there,\u201d Millen said, adding that Garner ranks alongside those of Virginia Woolf in the canon of great literary diarists.",
      "Garner, who has published novels, short stories, screenplays and true crime books, said she was \u201cstaggered\u201d to have won the prize for diaries she wrote entirely for herself.",
      "\u201cI never thought that I was writing for anyone but myself and that\u2019s what\u2019s good about them, I think \u2014 that I\u2019m free when I\u2019m writing,\" she told The Associated Press from Melbourne, Australia.",
      "\u201cThose are the hours of practice that in a sense turned me into a writer. Because I\u2019ve been keeping a diary since I was a girl \u2014 and I\u2019ve burnt most of it, of course. I burnt it up until about the late 1970s. But it\u2019s my 10,000 hours and it\u2019s my enormous daily practice. So you never expect that to be out in the public eye. But it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow to End a Story\u201d is a deeply intimate book that among other things recounts, with unsparing detail and flashes of humor, the breakdown of a marriage.",
      "Despite the risk involved in such public soul-baring, Garner says the reaction of readers has made the experience life-affirming.",
      "\u201cWhat I write about \u2014 my life and my experience and my, not to put too fine a point on it, soul \u2014 there are so many people who know what I mean and who\u2019ve been there. And that\u2019s been a great joy to me to discover that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe deeper I go, the more other people I find there.\u201d",

      "What are called autoimmune diseases can affect just about every part of the body \u2013 and tens of millions of people. While most common in women, these diseases can strike anyone, adults or children, and they\u2019re on the rise.",
      "New research is raising the prospect of treatments that might do more than tamp down symptoms. Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Here are some things to know.",
      "They\u2019re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.",
      "They\u2019re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a \u201cflare\u201d for no apparent reason.",
      "Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s also can harm major organs, for example.",
      "Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.",
      "The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over. Key is that it can distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou,\u201d what scientists call tolerance.",
      "Sometimes confused immune cells or antibodies slip through, or the peacemakers can\u2019t calm things down after a battle. If the system can\u2019t spot and fix the problem, autoimmune diseases gradually develop.",

      "Most autoimmune diseases, especially in adults, aren\u2019t caused by a specific gene defect. Instead, a variety of genes that affect immune functions can make people susceptible. Scientists say it then takes some \u201cenvironmental\u201d trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",
      "Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury \u2014 but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.",
      "Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women\u2019s vulnerability.",
      "But men do suffer from autoimmune diseases. One especially severe one named VEXAS syndrome wasn\u2019t discovered until 2020. It mainly affects men over 50 and in addition to typical autoimmune symptoms it can cause blood clots, shortness of breath and night sweats.",
      "Certain populations also have higher risks. For example, lupus is more common in Black and Hispanic women. Northern Europeans have a higher risk of MS than other groups.",
      "According to investment research company Morningstar, the global market for autoimmune disease treatments is $100 billion a year. That\u2019s not counting doctor visits and such things as lost time at work. Treatment is lifelong and, while usually covered by insurance, can be pricey.",
      "Not so long ago there was little to offer for many autoimmune diseases beyond high-dose steroids and broad immune-suppressing drugs, with side effects that include a risk of infections and cancer. Today some newer options target specific molecules, somewhat less immune dampening. But for many autoimmune diseases, treatment is trial and error, with little to guide patient decisions.",

    "story": [
      "It's one of medicine's biggest mysteries \u2014 why sometimes our immune system attacks our own bodies",
      "Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson\u2019s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.",
      "That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman\u2019s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her immune system had been attacking her own body all that time and nobody caught it.",
      "\u201cI just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,\u201d she said.",
      "Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms \u2014 and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues\u2019 gallery of autoimmune diseases that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide \u2013 hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine\u2019s biggest mysteries.",
      "Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They\u2019re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones \u2013 in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.",
      "It's a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in multiple sclerosis, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sj\u00f6gren's disease, destroys insulin production in Type 1 diabetes, weakens muscles in myositis and myasthenia gravis \u2014 and in lupus, it can cause body-wide havoc.",
      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",
      "\u201cYou look normal. People see you and they don\u2019t think you have this horrible disease,\u201d said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.",
      "While there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.",
      "In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients' own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It's called CAR-T therapy and early results with these \u201cliving drugs\u201d are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.",
      "And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they\u2019ll need insulin. Citing that \u201ctantalizing evidence,\u201d the NIH\u2019s new five-year plan for autoimmune research \u2014 if it gets funded \u2014 urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad life, it\u2019s just a bad day,\u201d she tells herself to get through.",
      "Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.",
      "\u201cThese are my babies,\u201d said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan\u2019s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.",
      "Kwong is performing something so tricky it's not done in many laboratories: He's growing batches of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most common white blood cells.",
      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N.

      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits.

But he was one of 362 people age 65 or older who received a new heart in 2012, according to the U.S. Organ Procurement and Transplant Network, or OPTN.",
      "There's a huge need for more transplantable hearts. Hundreds of thousands of adults suffer from advanced heart failure yet many are never placed on the transplant list, in part because of the organ shortage.

      "Those who reach shelter in Tawila, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) from el-Fasher, find themselves stranded in a barren area with barely enough tents, many of them improvised from patched tarps and sheets, according to a video posted by the group Sudan\u2019s IDPs and Refugee Camps. It shows children running across the area as a few adults carry a large pot of food, hoping it will be enough to feed the growing crowds of displaced.",
      "Since the Rapid Support Forces, RSF, seized el-Fasher from the rival military Oct. 26, more than 16,200 people have fled to the camps in Tawila, said Adam Rojal, spokesperson for the aid group. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 82,000 people had fled the city and surrounding areas as of Nov. 4, heading to safe spots including Tawila, an area already overcrowded with the displaced from previous attacks, with some making the journey on foot.",
      "The RSF and the Sudanese army have been at war since April 2023, following simmering tensions over control of Africa's third-largest nation. At least 40,000 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization, though the actual toll might be many times higher. Some 12 million people have been displaced, and nearly half the population are facing acute food insecurity.",
      "Last week, the RSF seized el-Fasher after an 18-month siege. The paramilitary rampaged through the Saudi Hospital in the city, killing over 450 people, according to the WHO, and went house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. The RSF has denied killing anyone at the Saudi hospital, but testimonies from those fleeing, online videos and satellite images offer an apocalyptic vision of the attack.",

      "At least 2,000 people working at overseas bases in Europe have had their salaries interrupted since the shutdown began almost six weeks ago. In some cases, governments hosting the U.S. bases have stepped in to foot the bill, expecting the United States to eventually make good. In others, including in Italy and Portugal, workers have simply kept working unpaid as the gridlock in Washington drags on.",

      "\u201cWe are waiting for urgent responses, as there are workers struggling to pay their mortgages, to support their children or even to pay the fuel to come to work,\u201d Zaccaria said.

      "Tensions have escalated in recent weeks following deadly border fighting that killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. The violence erupted after explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9, which Afghanistan's Taliban government said were drone strikes conducted by Pakistan and vowed to avenge. The clashes subsided after Qatar brokered a ceasefire on Oct. 19, which remains tenuously in place.",
      "Afghanistan's government spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, blamed Pakistan for the talks' failure, saying that \u201cPakistan\u2019s demands in the negotiations were unreasonable and the talks could not proceed, the meeting ended and the talks are at a standstill for now.\u201d",
      "Speaking during a press conference from the southern Afghan city of Kandahar Saturday, Mujahid said Afghanistan \u201c(does) not want insecurity in the region, and entering into war is not our first choice,\u201d but he noted that \u201cif war breaks out, we have the right to defend ourselves.\u201d",
      "Earlier, he had reiterated in a written statement that Afghanistan \u201cwill not allow anyone to use its territory against another country, nor permit actions that undermine its sovereignty or security.\u201d",
      "The two-day talks in Istanbul, mediated by Turkey and Qatar, were the third round of peace negotiations that were viewed as one of the most significant diplomatic efforts between the two neighbors since the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan 2021. Despite intense back-channel diplomacy, officials said discussions stalled late Friday without tangible progress.",
      "Pakistani Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told the private Geo News channel late Friday that the \u201ctalks are over\u201d and that the Pakistani delegation was returning home with \u201cno plan for any future meetings.\u201d He added that the ceasefire would remain in place as long as \u201cit is not violated from the Afghan side.\u201d",

It was followed by six days of talks in Istanbul, which resulted in an agreement to extend the truce and hold a third round on Nov. 6 and 7 \u2014 talks that ultimately failed to produce any breakthrough.",

      "Women in Mexico face daily fears of harassment and violence, especially when using public transportation and rideshare apps",
      "MEXICO CITY -- When a male driver from a popular rideshare app asked Ninfa Fuentes for her phone number during a ride through Mexico City, she froze. But when he repeatedly pressed her about her Valentine\u2019s Day plans, a rush of terror flooded her body.",
      "What should have been a quiet ride home at the end of the workday three years ago turned into a nightmare that many women in Mexico experience daily: holding their breath until they know they've made it home alive.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was dying,\u201d Fuentes, 48, said. An international economics researcher and a survivor of sexual violence, she has not used public transportation or ride-hailing services since.",
      "The conversation around startling levels of sexual harassment and gender-based violence came roaring back this week after Mexico\u2019s first woman president, Claudia Sheinbaum, was captured in video being groped by a drunk man.",
      "Following the incident, Sheinbaum said she had pressed charges against the man and unveiled a plan to make sexual harassment a crime across all Mexican states \u2014 a bid to make it easier for women to report such assaults in a country where an average of 10 women are killed daily.",
      "After her frightening rideshare app experience, Fuentes turned to AmorrAs, a self-managed feminist network that provides safe transportation \u2014 and support \u2014 for women in Mexico City and its suburbs.",
      "AmorrAs seeks to offer a solution to the endemic problem of sexual harassment and other forms of gender-based violence that women routinely face on Mexico\u2019s rideshare apps and public transit.",
      "The network was founded by 29-year-old Karina Alba following the 2022 killing of Debanhi Escobar, who was found dead days after getting out of a taxi on a dark highway in the northern city of Monterrey.",
      "Alba founded AmorrAs with the hope of providing safe rides for women, choosing her mother, taxi driver Ruth Rojas, to be the network\u2019s first driver. The network now has more than 20 women-only \u201cally\u201d drivers, serving more than 2,000 women per year.",
      "\u201cMy dream was to contribute to society in some way,\" said Alba. \u201cI decided to do so by creating a safe space for women, one where they can live with dignity and free from violence.\u201d",
      "On a recent afternoon, 38-year-old Dian Colmenero received a WhatsApp message from Alba confirming that the woman she was going to drive was waiting at her workplace. On the receiving end, the passenger read a message with the trip details, her \u201cally\u201d driver\u2019s name and number, and a reassuring pink heart emoji. Her \u201cally\u201d driver would be with her soon.",
      "For security reasons, women have to schedule their rides with AmorrAs in advance by filling a form. The price for each ride then varies based on the distance traveled.",
      "Colmenero, who works in marketing when she is not driving with AmorrAs, stole a kiss from her partner, petted her old Yorkie before heading out to one of the city\u2019s financial districts.",
      "\u201cBefore driving with AmorrAs, I had experienced violence on public transport, on the subway, and even with ride-hailing apps,\u201d she said. \u201cI once had to ride with a driver who told me and my partner that he had beaten up several women.\u201d",
      "Colmenero greeted her regular passenger, Ninfa Fuentes, with a warm hug. They chatted about their families, the book Fuentes is writing and their shared recent ADHD diagnosis.",
      "As the noise of the capital\u2019s traffic rattles the car, Fuentes peers out the window, confident that she will arrive home safe and sound.",

      "The National Citizen Observatory on Femicide says sex crimes in Mexico are the least reported due to the high level of stigma surrounding them and the lack of credibility authorities often extend to women\u2019s reports.",
      "Lawyer Norma Escobar, 32, collaborates with AmorrAs, offering legal support to women who say they have been harassed or assaulted.",
      "On more than one occasion, Escobar said she heard a forensic doctor in the gender crimes department of the Mexico state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office dismiss women filing a sexual assault complaint, telling them \u201cNothing has happened to you, there have been worse cases.\u201d",
      "Escobar, who handles harassment cases on the street and on public transportation, said that the absence of a forensic doctor has on occasions prevented women from officially filing a report.",
      "A spokesperson from Mexico state\u2019s Attorney General\u2019s Office, when reached by The Associated Press, said they had no knowledge of the doctor's alleged comment, but when problems have been discovered the office has taken action against those involved.",
      "Experts and advocates say the history of violence against women in Mexico is rooted in deep-seated cultural machismo and systemic gender inequality, alongside a justice system riddled with problems.",
      "\u201cSeeing that the authorities downplay it, women end up often giving up on their cases,\u201d said Escobar, noting that when it comes to ensuring women's access to justice, \"there is a lack of attention, commitment and professionalism from authorities.\u201d",
      "Like many other women in Mexico, Nejoi Meddeb, 30, always traveled with her hand locked on the door handle so she could escape if needed. That is how 23-year-old Lidia Gabriela G\u00f3mez died in 2022 when she jumped out of a moving taxi in Mexico City after the driver took a different route than the one she had requested.",
      "Maria Jos\u00e9 Cabrera, a 28-year-old engineer, said she was followed by a man when she got off a minibus on her way to the train. She ran to take refuge in the subway car reserved for women only. On another occasion, in one of the city\u2019s mixed subway cars, she said a man touched her inappropriately and, by the time she reacted, he was gone.",
      "Cabrera, who now rides with AmorrAs, said she also avoided wearing skirts and never went anywhere without making sure that someone she trusts was monitoring her journey \u2014 a common internalized protocol for many women in Mexico.",
      "\u201cFor me, AmorrAs represents being able to do things I couldn\u2019t do before,\" said Cabrera. \"I really enjoy going to concerts. It shouldn\u2019t be like that but if it weren\u2019t for them, I probably wouldn\u2019t be able to do it.\u201d",

      "Iraqis are preparing for a crucial parliamentary election",
      "BAGHDAD -- BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraqis are preparing to vote in a parliamentary election that comes at a crucial moment in the country and the region.",
      "The vote will begin Sunday with polling for members of the security forces and displaced people living in camps, and the general election is set for Tuesday.",
      "The outcome of the vote will influence whether Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani can serve a second term.",
      "The election comes amid fears of another war between Israel and Iran and potential Israeli or U.S. strikes on Iran-backed groups in Iraq. Baghdad seeks to maintain a delicate balance in its relations with Tehran and Washington amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration over the presence of Iran-linked armed groups.",
      "Here's a look at what to expect in the upcoming vote.",
      "This year's election will be the seventh since the U.S.-led invasion of 2003 that unseated the country's longtime strongman ruler, Saddam Hussein.",
      "In the security vacuum after Saddam's fall, the country fell into years of bloody civil war that saw the rise of extremist groups, including the Islamic State group. But in recent years, the violence has subsided. Rather than security, the main concern of many Iraqis now is the lack of job opportunities and lagging public services \u2014 including regular power cuts despite the country's energy wealth.",
      "Under the law, 25% of the country's 329 parliamentary seats must go to women, and nine seats are allocated for religious minorities. The position of speaker of Parliament is also assigned to a Sunni according to convention in Iraq\u2019s post-2003 power-sharing system, while the prime minister is always Shiite and the president a Kurd.",
      "Voter turnout has steadily fallen in recent elections. In the last parliamentary election in 2021, turnout was 41%, a record low in the post-Saddam era, down from 44% in the 2018 election, which at the time was an all-time low.",
      "However, only 21.4 million out of a total of 32 million eligible voters have updated their information and obtained voter cards, a decrease from the last parliamentary election in 2021, when about 24 million voters registered.",
      "Unlike past elections, there will be no polling stations outside of the country.",
      "There are 7,744 candidates competing, most of them from a range of largely sectarian-aligned parties, in addition to some independents.",
      "They include Shiite blocs led by former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, cleric Ammar al-Hakim, and several linked to armed groups; competing Sunni factions led by former Parliament speaker Mohammed al-Halbousi and current speaker Mahmoud al-Mashhadani; and the two main Kurdish parties, the Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.",
      "Several powerful, Iran-linked Shiite militias are participating in the election via associated political parties. They include the Kataib Hezbollah militia, with its Harakat Huqouq (Rights Movement) bloc, and the Sadiqoun Bloc led by the leader of the Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, Qais al-Khazali.",
      "However, one of the most prominent players in the country's politics is sitting the election out.",
      "The popular Sadrist Movement, led by influential Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, is boycotting. Al-Sadr\u2019s bloc won the largest number of seats in the 2021 election but later withdrew after failed negotiations over forming a government, amid a standoff with rival Shiite parties. He has since boycotted the political system.",

      "Meanwhile, some reformist groups emerging from mass anti-government protests that began in October 2019 are participating but have been bogged down by internal divisions and lack of funding and political support.",
      "There have been widespread allegations of corruption and vote-buying ahead of the election, and 848 candidates were disqualified by election officials, sometimes for obscure reasons such as allegedly insulting religious rituals or members of the armed forces.",
      "Past elections in Iraq were often marred by political violence, including assassinations of candidates, attacks on polling stations and clashes between supporters of different blocs.",
      "While overall levels of violence have subsided, a candidate was also assassinated in the run-up to this year's election.",
      "On Oct. 15, Baghdad Provincial Council member Safaa al-Mashhadani, a Sunni candidate in the al-Tarmiya district north of the capital, was killed by a car bomb. Five suspects have been arrested in connection with the killing, which is being prosecuted as a terrorist act.",
      "Al-Sudani came to power in 2022 with the backing of a group of pro-Iran parties but has since sought to balance Iraq\u2019s relations with Tehran and Washington. He has positioned himself as a pragmatist focused on improving public services.",
      "While Iraq has seen relative stability during al-Sudani's first term, he does not have an easy path to a second one. Only one Iraqi prime minister, Maliki, has served more than one term since 2003.",
      "The election outcome will not necessarily indicate whether or not al-Sudani stays. In several past elections in Iraq, the bloc winning the most seats has not been able to impose its preferred candidate.",
      "On one side, al-Sudani faces disagreements with some leaders in the Shiite Coordination Framework bloc that brought him to power over control of state institutions. On the other side, he faces increasing pressure from the U.S. to control the country's militias.",
      "A matter of particular contention has been the fate of the Popular Mobilization Forces, a coalition of militias that formed to fight the Islamic State group. It was formally placed under the control of the Iraqi military in 2016 but in practice still operates with significant autonomy. Members of the PMF will be voting alongside Iraqi army soldiers and other security forces on Saturday.",

      "Zaidi did not hesitate amid the deafening roar, hose in hand, her helmet strapped tight.",
      "The 23-year-old and the rest of her firefighting team \u2014 all men \u2014 aimed the jets of water at the molten rubber, which hissed and steamed under the torrent. The team worked methodically, every movement precise, every second critical.",
      "Hours later, the blaze was under control. Nearby factories were spared, no lives were lost \u2014 though the damage ran into tens of thousands of dollars (millions of Pakistani rupees).",
      "When the firefighters emerged from the smoke, their faces streaked with soot, dozens of onlookers cheered behind safety lines.",
      "Zaidi is a rare sight in a country where women firefighters were mostly unheard-of until 2024. Her career \u2014 like those of other women in Pakistan\u2019s emergency services \u2014 underscores the gradual inroads being made in the staunchly patriarchal and traditional Islamic nation.",

      "The battle for Pokrovsk is crucial for control of Ukraine's Donetsk region",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A critical moment for the future of Ukraine's Donetsk region is approaching as the battle for the city of Pokrovsk reaches a key stage, with Russian and Ukrainian forces so enmeshed that in some cases they\u2019re vying for control of the same residential building, soldiers and analysts told The Associated Press.",
      "But far from the battlefields of eastern Ukraine, Pokrovsk is also critical to a diplomatic struggle, as both Russia and Ukraine attempt to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that they have the upper hand in the fighting and the other side is weaker.",
      "Russia says its forces have surrounded Pokrovsk and thwarted a Ukrainian operation to reopen logistics lines into the city. Ukraine denies there\u2019s a blockade, describing the fighting as ongoing, with its forces inflicting heavy Russian losses.",
      "Russian forces entered Pokrovsk last month, taking advantage of gaps in Ukrainian defenses to slip through the lines, and appear poised to seize all of it in the coming weeks or months, experts say. Ukrainian commanders on the ground admit the outlook is bleak.",
      "\u201cAs of now there are no clear lines of defense, none that can obstruct soldiers from coming into the city,\u201d said Serhii Filimonov, a commander of Ukraine\u2019s Wolves of Da Vinci battalion. In an interview last week, he estimated the Russians control more than 70% of Pokrovsk.",
      "And Zelenskyy on Friday admitted Ukraine is in a difficult situation.",
      "\u201cThe enemy began assault operations on the 5th (of November) and has continued conducting assaults ... They have lost equipment, but the enemy\u2019s number-one goal is to occupy Pokrovsk as quickly as possible. That goal remains,\u201d he told reporters in Kyiv.",
      "Russia\u2019s recent success in Pokrovsk is the result of more than a year of grinding battles in which its forces advanced 39 kilometers (24 miles), according to calculations by the U.S.-based Institute for the Study of War.",
      "Neither Russia nor Ukraine disclose their casualty figures comprehensively, but analysts say that thousands of soldiers have been killed.",
      "The operation progressed, meter by meter, until last month when Russian assault groups overcame worn-down Ukrainian defenses.",
      "In response, Ukraine deployed its elite units, launching a special operation last week to counter potential advances. Commanders warn that the intense street-to-street fighting is reaching a critical point.",
      "Pokrovsk sits along the eastern front line, part of what has been dubbed the \u201cfortress belt\u201d of Donetsk, a line of heavily fortified cities crucial to Ukraine\u2019s defense of the region, including Kramatorsk, Sloviansk and Druzhkivka.",
      "Pokrovsk, which had a prewar population of 60,000, once served as a crucial logistics hub for Ukrainian forces. However, Russia used its artillery to establish an advantage over key routes, denying Ukrainian forces the ability to move freely, conduct evacuations and ferry in supplies.",
      "Pokrovsk is no longer just a battlefield for territory, but also a key setting intended to influence U.S. perceptions and sway the course of peace negotiations, analysts say.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin claims his forces are on the cusp of winning. As a prerequisite for peace, he demands that Ukraine cede the Donbas, made up of Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk, one of his key war aims.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, faced with U.S. pressure at times to accept Putin\u2019s terms, has sought to show Trump Russia is not winning. Armed with maps of the front line, Zelenskyy has softened Trump\u2019s ever-shifting stances.",

      "\u201cWe understand why they need Pokrovsk. They only need it to say \u2013 look, after all, the idea that Ukraine leaves the east and gives everything else that they want is the only possible one, otherwise they will supposedly capture more,\u201d he said.",

They will not say,\u201d Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at the Chatham House think tank in London.",
      "Dickinson said most of the logistics around Pokrovsk, such as roads and railways, have been destroyed, and the city is no longer as strategically valuable to the Ukrainians as it was.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s primarily a propaganda victory, a symbolic victory, a sort of a psychological victory, perhaps, for the Russians. They need to be able to show that \u2013 Putin desperately needs to be able to show that they\u2019re making progress,\u201d he said.",
      "Russian forces continue to advance from the north, west and east of Pokrovsk, according to experts, while Ukrainian forces maintain some pockets of control. Ukraine poured in more troops and its military intelligence directorate launched a counteroffensive operation earlier this month in an effort to hold the city for as long as possible.",

      "The next few weeks will likely unfold in the same way as most battles for territory in the region, experts said: Russia will pour troops into the parts of the city under its authority until Ukrainian forces are overwhelmed.",
      "In the meantime, Ukrainian forces will fight to extract as many losses as possible until the need for withdrawal can no longer be avoided.",

      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- Pirates off the coasts of Somalia have hijacked a commercial vessel for the first time in 18 months, raising fears of a resurgence of armed attacks along the coasts of Somalia.",
      "This week, the pirates have launched multiple attacks against vessels before successfully boarding the Malta-flagged Hellas Aphrodite, which was en route to India from South Africa and ferrying gasoline, according to the ship\u2019s owner, Latsco Marine Management Inc. EU Naval reached the ship on Friday and found all crew members safe.",
      "The last time the pirates boarded a ship was in May 2024, when they hijacked the Liberian-flagged vessel Basilisk around 380 nautical miles east of Mogadishu. The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said there was another close incident in the area on Friday, but the ship outran the pirate vessel.",
      "Experts say Thursday\u2019s seizure might be a prelude to more assaults because conditions along the coasts have changed due to the redistribution of naval forces and a weakened government in Mogadishu, which is battling armed groups offshore.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is also increasing reports of pirate groups hijacking vessels and recruiting new pirates, as well as arming themselves,\u201d Timothy Walker, a senior maritime researcher at the Institute of Security Studies, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThose were major signs that attacks were likely, with the fact that there was less deterrence than before, and some have taken the chance and succeeded with some of the attacks.\u201d",
      "Here is what to know about the pirates and their impact on maritime commerce and security:",
      "Through the 1980s, Somalia experienced a brutal civil war that briefly stopped in 1991. The war, which arose from opposition to the Siad Barre-led military junta, fractured the East African nation to this day, with several armed groups controlling parts of the country.",

      "Military authorities and international agencies have attempted to counter piracy for decades, but the vastness of the Indian Ocean and the Gulf of Aden make the region difficult for military ships to patrol.",
      "Somali pirates have the capacity to operate about 1,000 kilometers from shore by using mother ships \u2014 a large ship on which smaller vessels like skiffs can be launched to reach deep waters. This allows them to operate away from the less patrolled coast. They usually confront a vessel with heavy ammunition to slow it down. Once a vessel has been boarded with light ladders, pirates typically move the vessel towards Somalia and hold it for ransom.",
      "Analysts say that coastal patrolling has been neglected because Somalia, a war-torn country with a fractured government, has shifted its attention to battling internal armed groups.",
      "\u201cThat is why you can have as much protection at sea, but if you are not preventing pirates from forming groups offshore and launching attacks, you are not really able to stem the problem. You are only dealing with the symptom,\u201d Walker said.",

      "NEW YORK -- U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer signed a deal to purchase development-stage obesity drugmaker Metsera Inc., winning a bidding war against Novo Nordisk, the Danish drugmaker behind weight-loss treatments Ozempic and Wegovy.",
      "Metsera, based in New York, has no products on the market, but it is developing oral and injectable treatments. That includes some potential treatments that could target lucrative fields for obesity and diabetes.",
      "The deal comes as Pfizer is attempting to develop its own stake in that market, several months after ending development of a potential pill treatment for obesity.",
      "In a statement issued Friday, Metsera said Pfizer will acquire the company for up to $86.25 per share, consisting of $65.60 per share in cash and a contingent value right entitling holders to additional payments of up to $20.65 per share in cash.",
      "Metsera cited U.S. antitrust risks in Novo\u2019s bid, saying in its statement that the board has determined Pfizer\u2019s revised terms represent \u201cthe best transaction for shareholders, both from the perspective of value and certainty of closing.\u201d",
      "The deal comes three days after Novo Nordisk raised the stakes in its push to outbid Pfizer, saying Tuesday it would offer to pay as much as $10 billion for Metsera. That was higher than its previous bid of up to $9 billion which sparked a lawsuit from Pfizer.",

      "Novo Nordisk said Saturday it would not increase its offer and would leave the race to acquire Metsera.",
      "Novo's proposed deal had involved paying $62.20 in cash for each Metsera share, up from its previous bid of $56.50. The Danish drugmaker planned to tack on a contingent value right payment of $24, another improvement from its previous bid, if certain development and regulatory milestones were met.",

      "Washington's local economy has taken blows from a series of actions by the Trump administration, from the layoffs of federal workers to the ongoing law enforcement intervention with the National Guard",
      "WASHINGTON -- With the combination of the longest government shutdown, the mass firings of government workers and a fresh cut in federal food aid, the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington is bracing for the swell of people who will need its help before the holiday season.",
      "The food bank, which serves 400 pantries and aid organizations in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and two Maryland counties, is providing 8 million more meals than it had prepared to this budget year \u2014 a nearly 20% increase.",
      "The city is being hit \u201cespecially hard,\" said Radha Muthiah, the group's CEO and president, \"because of the sequence of events that has occurred over the course of this year.\"",
      "The nation's capital has been battered by a series of decisions by the Trump administration, from the layoffs of federal workers to the ongoing law enforcement intervention into the district. The added blow of the shutdown, which has furloughed workers and paused money for food assistance, is only deepening the economic toll.",
      "The latest figures from the D.C. Office of Revenue Analysis do not account for workforce changes since the shutdown that began Oct. 1. But even the September jobs report shows that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hovers at 6%, compared with the most recent national rate of 4.3%, and has been the highest in the nation for months.",
      "The economic woes appear to be reverberating politically. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won election Tuesday as Virginia's governor after focusing her campaign message on the effects of President Donald Trump's actions on the state\u2019s economy.",
      "The shutdown's long-term impact on the regional economy will be felt long after the government reopens, experts say.",
      "Washington has the country's largest share of federal workers \u2014 about 20%, according to official figures \u2014 and roughly 150,000 federal employees call the area home. By Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country will have missed at least two full paychecks because of the shutdown. Nationally, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, while about 730,000 are working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "During the shutdown, the number of federal employees on Washington\u2019s transit system each weekday has dropped by about one-quarter compared with ridership in September. Eateries that the Restaurant Association of Greater Washington says were already dealing with thin margins from seasonal declines and the fallout from Trump\u2019s deployment of armed National Guard members on city streets are facing more challenges at a time when owners had hoped for a rebound.",
      "Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro, a think tank, said that going without paychecks is causing significant cash flow issues for federal workers, potentially leading to defaults on mortgages and student loans. For local businesses, especially those reliant on federal workers\u2019 discretionary spending, it could exacerbate the impact during the high-sales October-December quarter.",
      "\u201cA lot of businesses rely on higher spending in Q4 in order to have a revenue positive year,\u201d Loh said.",

Her husband, a government contractor, also lost his job at a museum. Since then, they have lived on savings, Medicaid and SNAP.",
      "Price, 37, recently went to a food pantry in Arlington, Virginia, for the first time recently. The shutdown halted funding for SNAP, after it took her months to get it, and the $500 payments she receives each month were set to stop.

      "Being falsely accused of setting fire in the Amazon with funds from Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio has become a blessing in disguise for Caetano Scannavino",
      "SAO PAULO -- Being falsely accused of setting fire in the Amazon with funds from an Oscar-winning actor eventually became a blessing in disguise for Caetano Scannavino, the founder of a nonprofit organization in the heart of the rainforest.",
      "Brazil's then President Jair Bolsonaro falsely claimed in November 2019 that actor Leonardo DiCaprio had funded nonprofit groups that he alleged were partly responsible for setting the fires. The accusation, though false, created risks for Scannavino and his work promoting sustainable development and citizens' rights in a region along the Tapajos River popular with tourists for its blend of rainforest and beaches.",
      "Four of Scannavino's friends who volunteered as forest firefighters were jailed for two days and then prosecuted as alleged perpetrators of fires in the region, only to be cleared later. Police scrolled through documents of Scannavino\u2019s Sa\u00fade e Alegria nonprofit for weeks. Scannavino received anonymous threats, and his car was set on fire.",
      "But Bolsonaro's comments helped DiCaprio take notice of Scannavino's work and decide to sponsor his work through Re:wild, a nonprofit conservation group that the actor helped found. Their partnership has already lasted five years, the Brazilian activist said.",
      "\u201cWhen the accusations emerged, DiCaprio came out to say he was not funding us, but added we deserved his support after he saw our work,\u201d Scannavino told The Associated Press in a phone interview. \u201cI've never been with him or spoken to him. But he gives us support, uses his social media to show what this partnership does.\u201d",
      "The 59-year-old Scannavino founded Saude e Alegria, or Health and Happiness, in 1987 to promote integrated and sustainable community development in Para state, whose capital Belem will host the United Nations' Conference of the Parties, or COP30, next week. Scannavino arrived in Belem on Tuesday from Santarem, the city where the initiative is based, after a two-day boat ride that featured broadcasts with journalists, activists and climate experts.",
      "The project started as a health care initiative, but it has since grown to work with rural communities to improve their quality of life and exercise of citizenship.",
      "One project sponsored by DiCaprio's institute is the Forest Economy EcoCenter in Santarem, which serves as a hub for processing, storage and commercialization of products made by locals. Organizers said the facility enhances the economic viability of sustainable practices in the region.",
      "The hub was opened a year ago, and is also supported by the governments of Brazil, Germany and Norway, all contributors of the Amazon Fund, a Brazilian initiative that pays for anti-deforestation and sustainable development efforts.",
      "Scannavino said that the initiative cost about 5 million Brazilian reais ($938,000), mostly paid for by the Amazon Fund.",
      "\u201cThose first few days after Bolsonaro's accusation were terrible. People insulted us and our families on the streets, the firefighters had to leave. But then a surprising thing happened,\u201d Scannavino said.",
      "\u201cUsually people get away from you if such a big target appears on your back. It was the opposite with us. Eventually the accusations went away, the firefighters were released, and people were curious about us \u2014 including DiCaprio,\u201d he added.",
      "In an Instagram post this week, DiCaprio said the world leaders gathering in Brazil must ensure that those defending nature have the resources they need. He said Re:wild is pledging more money to protecting forests.",
      "\u201cI urge leaders to unite and meet the moment,\u201d he said. \u201cOur future depends on it.\u201d",

      "The former president was recently sentenced to 27 years in prison for a coup attempt in 2023 after losing his reelection bid.",
      "\u201cOur critics are specialists in hatred, and since that incident we chose to be polite, provide evidence we worked with all stakeholders, everyone who mattered in the region. We refused to leave our local communities without due health care assistance just because of an absurd accusation,\u201d Scannavino said.",
      "Many awards and acknowledgments later, Scannavino is expected to meet with Re:wild officials and perhaps DiCaprio himself at COP30.",
      "Scannavino said that he nearly met DiCaprio about 20 years ago while setting up for a photo exhibition in New York. He said that the team preparing the photo exhibition didn't recognize the actor under a cap and complained that he was getting in the way, so he left.",
      "\u201cShortly later our producer raced to tell me that was Leonardo DiCaprio,\" Scannavino said. \"I told her to run after him and get him back. She caught him on his bike a few blocks away. He thanked her, but had to leave.",

      "The aim is simple, but lofty: for countries to work together to stop the worst effects of human-caused climate change.",
      "That's a goal many experts say is slipping out of reach. But the stakes are high. Climate change is already escalating disasters that mean life or death for billions of people around the world, and delaying action will only worsen the problem.",
      "Here's what you need to know about COP30.",
      "With the world's largest rainforest on its doorstep, many have lauded Belem as well-positioned to highlight the role of Indigenous peoples and land stewardship in addressing climate change.",
      "Although many past COPs have primarily focused on transitioning to cleaner energy sources, research has shown that shifting food systems is also a must. Countries also need to stop destroying the ecosystems that suck up pollution and protect humans from diseases.",
      "The government of Brazil is spearheading a new initiative called the Tropical Forests Forever Facility, a program designed to give nations a monetary reward for protecting forests. It remains to be seen whether world leaders will pledge enough money to make the project a success.",
      "Before the conference, many would-be attendees worried about whether the city could host tens of thousands of people. Delegates have booked rooms on cruise ships in the harbor. Others are staying in by-the-hour \u201clove motels,\" and some activists said they might camp out.",
      "The weather is expected to be oppressively hot and humid, and as such the host country has already written to attendees to make the dress code a little more informal.",
      "But some experts and locals say any discomfort is a much-needed reality check, especially for those coming from rich countries. The government of Brazil was adamant that the conference needed to be in Belem to showcase what's at stake: Poorer communities are often more vulnerable to disasters worsened by climate change.",
      "Ten years ago, countries made a historic deal in the first global pact to fight climate change.",
      "Since then, the planet\u2019s annual temperature has already jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit), one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus.

      "\u201cIt's like an insider-outsider thing,\u201d Guy Berger, head of research at the Burning Glass Institute said, \u201cwhere outsiders that need jobs are struggling to get their foot in, even as insiders are insulated by what up until now is a low-layoff environment.\u201d",
      "Several large companies have recently announced tens of thousands of job cuts in the past few weeks, including UPS, Target, and IBM, though Berger said it is too soon to tell whether they signal a turn for the worse in the economy. But a rise in job cuts would be particularly challenging with hiring already so low.",
      "For now, it's harder than ever to get a clear read on the job market because the government shutdown has cut off the U.S. Department of Labor's monthly employment reports. The October jobs report was scheduled for release Friday but has been delayed, like the September figures before it. The October report may be less comprehensive when it is released because not all the data may be collected.",
      "Before the shutdown, the Labor Department reported that the hiring rate \u2014 the number of people hired in a given month, as a percentage of those employed \u2014 fell to 3.2% in August, matching the lowest figure outside the pandemic since March 2013.",
      "Back then, the unemployment rate was a painful 7.5%, as the economy slowly recovered from the job losses from the 2008-2009 Great Recession. That is much higher than August's 4.3%.",
      "Many of those out of work are skeptical of the current low rate. Brad Mislow, 54, has been mostly unemployed for the past three years after losing a job as an advertising executive in New York City. Now he is substitute teaching to make ends meet.",
      "\u201cIt is frustrating to hear that the unemployment rate is low, the economy is great,\" he said. \u201cI think there are people in this economy who are basically fighting every day and holding on to pieces of flotsam in the shark-filled waters or, they have no idea what it's like.\u201d",
      "With the government closed, financial markets are paying closer attention to private-sector data, but that is also mixed. On Thursday, the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas unnerved investors with a report that announced job cuts surged 175% in October from a year ago.",
      "Yet on Wednesday, payroll processor ADP said that net hiring picked up in October as businesses added 42,000 jobs, after two months of declines. Still, the gain was modest. ADP's figures are based on anonymous data from the 26 million workers at its client companies.",
      "Separately, Revelio Labs, a workplace analytics company, estimated Thursday that the economy shed 9,000 jobs in October. The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago estimates that the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4% last month.",
      "Even when the government was releasing data, economists and officials at the Federal Reserve weren't sure how healthy the job market was or where it was headed next. A sharp drop in immigration and stepped-up deportations have helped keep the unemployment rate low simply by reducing the supply of workers. The economy doesn't need to create as many jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising.",

      "Former NBA player and assistant coach Damon Jones has pleaded not guilty to charges he profited from rigged poker games and provided sports bettors with non-public information about injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis",
      "NEW YORK -- Former NBA player and assistant coach Damon Jones pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he profited from rigged poker games and provided sports bettors with non-public information about injuries to stars LeBron James and Anthony Davis.",
      "Jones, a onetime teammate of James, said little during back-to-back arraignments in federal court in Brooklyn, letting his court-appointed lawyer enter not guilty pleas in a pair of cases stemming from last month\u2019s federal takedown of sprawling gambling operations.",
      "Jones, 49, acknowledged he read both indictments and that he understood the charges and his bail conditions, which include his mother and stepfather putting up their Texas home as collateral for a $200,000 bond that will allow him to remain free pending trial.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer, Kenneth Montgomery, told a judge that they \u201cmay be engaging in plea negotiations.\u201d He is due back in court for a preliminary conference with other defendants on Nov. 24.",
      "Jones was among more than 30 people arrested in the gambling sweep. The others included reputed mobsters and prominent basketball figures, including Portland Trail Blazers head coach and Basketball Hall of Famer Chauncey Billups and Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier.",
      "Sports bettor Marves Fairley also pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges alleging he cashed in on information about injuries to NBA players, including some that prosecutors say Jones provided to him.",
      "Jones, an NBA journeyman, earned more than $20 million playing for 10 teams in 11 seasons from 1999 to 2009. He and James played together in Cleveland from 2005 to 2008 and he served as an unofficial assistant coach for James\u2019 Los Angeles Lakers during the 2022-2023 season.",
      "According to prosecutors, Jones sold or attempted to sell non-public information to bettors that James was injured and wouldn't be playing in a Feb. 9, 2023, game against the Milwaukee Bucks, texting an unnamed co-conspirator: \u201cGet a big bet on Milwaukee tonight before the information is out.\u201d",
      "James wasn't listed on the Lakers' injury report at the time of the text message, but the NBA's all-time scoring leader was later ruled out of the game because of a lower body jury, according to prosecutors, and the Lakers lost the game 115-106.",
      "On Jan. 15, 2024, prosecutors said, Fairley paid Jones approximately $2,500 for a tip that Davis, the Lakers' forward and center at the time, would see limited playing time against the Oklahoma City Thunder because of an injury.",
      "Fairley then placed a $100,000 bet on the Thunder to win, prosecutors said, but the tip was wrong. Davis played his usual minutes, scored 27 points and collected 15 rebounds in a 112-105 Lakers win, prompting Fairley to demand a refund of his $2,500 fee, prosecutors said.",

As part of his bail agreement, his travel is restricted to parts of Texas and New York City. He was allowed to keep his passport to use as identification for flying until he obtains a REAL ID, which his lawyer said should happen soon.",
      "A hot hand from outside the three-point arc, Jones once proclaimed himself in an interview with insidehoops.com as \u201cthe best shooter in the world.\u201d He played in every regular season game for three consecutive seasons from 2003 to 2006.",
      "After his playing days, he worked as a \u201cshooting consultant\u201d for the Cavaliers and was an assistant coach when the team, led by James, won the NBA championship in 2016.",
      "In the poker scheme, according to prosecutors, Jones was among former NBA players used to lure unwitting players into poker games that were rigged using altered shuffling machines, hidden cameras, special sunglasses and even X-ray equipment built into the table.",
      "According to the indictment, Jones was paid $2,500 for a game in the Hamptons where he was instructed to cheat by paying close attention to others involved in the scheme. His instructor likened those people to James and NBA All-Star Steph Curry, prosecutors said. When in doubt, Jones was told to fold his hand, prosecutors said.",
      "In response, according to prosecutors, Jones texted: \u201cy'all know I know what I'm doing!!\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump has appointed Andrea Lucas as chair of the nation's top workplace civil rights agency",
      "President Donald Trump has named Andrea Lucas as chair of the country's top workplace civil rights agency, the agency announced Thursday. The move signals a vote of confidence for Lucas's efforts to stamp out diversity programs, roll back protections for transgender workers and prioritize religious rights in the workplace.",
      "First nominated to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 2020 during Trump's first administration, Lucas was confirmed in July for a second five-year term. Democratic lawmakers and dozens of civil rights organizations strongly opposed Lucas\u2019 confirmation, accusing her of politicizing the agency against Congress\u2019s intent and undermining workers' civil rights. Republican senators praised her leadership, especially her commitment to rolling back Biden-era guidance on workplace gender identity protections, which Lucas has argued overstepped the EEOC\u2019s authority.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m honored to be designated Chair of the EEOC,\u201d Lucas said in an emailed statement Thursday. \u201cUnder the Trump Administration, the Commission has made significant progress advancing its core mission to uphold our nation\u2019s civil rights laws and protect American workers through consistent, effective enforcement. As Chair, I remain committed to enforcing the law evenhandedly, advancing equal opportunity, and upholding merit-based, colorblind equality in America\u2019s workplaces.\u201d",
      "Trump elevated Lucas to acting chair in January and, in an unprecedented move, fired two Democratic commissioners, clearing the way to establish a Republican majority in the agency. The Senate last month confirmed Trump pick Brittany Panuccio as a commissioner, restoring the EEOC to the full power needed to deepen his overhaul of civil rights enforcement.",
      "In a shake-up of the agency's prior focus, the EEOC under Lucas's leadership has taken on several religious discrimination cases, including a charge against Mayo Clinic alleging it refused to grant a security guard\u2019s request for a religious accommodation to a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy. The hospital system did not immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "It has also dropped lawsuits on behalf of transgender workers, subjected incoming complaints related to gender identity to heightened scrutiny, and stopped investigating complaints based on \u201c disparate impact liability, \u201d a concept in U.S. civil rights law designed to root out employment practices that disadvantage different demographic groups. Lucas has leveraged the agency to help the Trump administration target private institutions over their DEI programs.",

People across the country are struggling to make ends meet and find stability at work, and we will fight to ensure they\u2019re able to work safely, free from harassment and discrimination,\" she said.",
      "Conservative legal organization Wisconsin Institute for Law & Liberty, however, expressed optimism for the agency's future. \u201cAndrea Lucas is a champion of equality and race-neutrality,\u201d said WILL vice president and deputy counsel Dan Lennington. \u201cThe EEOC will be pivotal in extinguishing race-conscious policies, like DEI, from the private sector.

      "But despite perfect conditions Ireland struggled until the last quarter for rhythm, with passes awry and the set-pieces shaky again. The arrival off the bench of the Prendergast brothers, Cian and Sam, and Jack Conan, boosted Ireland's energy against a flagging Japan and three tries in the last 14 minutes gave the scoreline an unwarranted glow.",
      "Ireland won by six tries to one with Australia coming next weekend. But the more pertinent numbers were 19 handling errors by Ireland and 17 by Japan.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to put in a better performance for the home crowd,\u201d Ireland standout Tommy O'Brien told broadcaster TNT. \u201cWe brought plenty of energy and improved massively in the second half. We had a few new players out there today and tried to play a fast brand of rugby so that will come with errors.\u201d",
      "The Irish scored only two tries in the first half. Flyhalf Jack Crowley, with an assist from captain Caelan Doris, finished off their most fluid move but that was against 14 men. Then flanker Nick Timoney burned the Japanese defense with his fifth try in five tests across four years after Japan hesitated when Tadhg Beirne dropped a catch that James Ryan cleaned up.",
      "Crowley's goalkicks made it 17-0 after 30 minutes.",
      "But Japan was doing all the entertaining, especially backs Kippei Ishida and Naoto Saito. Their positivity \u2014 forcing Ireland to make twice as many tackles \u2014 was rewarded by the crowd cheering their 10-man rolling maul carrying Kenji Sato over for a converted try near halftime.",

    "story": [
      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "In Beijing, the Commerce Ministry also said Saturday that it agreed to a Dutch request to send representatives to China for \"consultations.\"",

      "The company says U.S. Customs and Border Protection has been detaining imported components at ports on suspicion that they contain materials that may have been made with forced labor in China, meaning it can't run its solar panel assembly lines at full strength.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced in August that her department was stepping up enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a 2021 law that restricts Chinese goods made with forced labor from entering the U.S. Published reports indicate that U.S. officials began detaining solar cells made by Qcells in June. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection couldn't immediately answer questions about Qcells on Friday.",
      "Qcells says none of its materials or components are made with forced labor or even come from China. Spokesperson Marta Stoepker said the company maintains \u201crobust supply chain due diligence measures\u201d and \u201cvery detailed documentation,\u201d which has been successful in getting some shipments released.",
      "\u201cOur latest supply chain is sourced completely outside of China and our legacy supply chains contain no material from Xinjiang province based on third party audits and supplier guarantees,\u201d Stoepker said.",

      "Don't lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness.",
      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",
      "But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It\u2019s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn't involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.",
      "Also, U.S. supplements don\u2019t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.",
      "Meanwhile, patients wondering about melatonin should talk it over with their doctors, said Emory\u2019s Sandesara. Generally doctors recommend it for short-term use, like for jet lag.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",

      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",

There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lisa Emery, a respiratory therapist, is deeply concerned about West Virginia coal miners suffering from black lung disease",
      "OAK HILL, W.Va. -- Lisa Emery loves to talk about her \u201cboys.\u201d With each word, the respiratory therapist\u2019s face softens and shines with pride. But keep her talking, and it doesn\u2019t take long for that passion to switch to hurt. She knows the names, ages, families and the intimate stories of each one\u2019s scarred lungs. She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

      "Joe Megna was just a teenager when his dad left for the No. 9 mine in Farmington on the day he was set to retire in November 1968.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018This is your last shift, don\u2019t go to work, we\u2019ll go trout fishing,\u2019\u201d Megna said, recalling his dad\u2019s dutiful response to the company. \u201cHe said: \u2018I owe them that much.\u2019\u201d",
      "Megna said his father then told him he loved him \u2014 for the first time \u2014 and drove off.",
      "\u201cThis was the last time we talked,\u201d he said.",
      "Early the next morning, the ground shook so hard, it was felt miles away. Roaring plumes of smoke billowed more than 100 feet into the sky from a raging fire. Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",
      "On the opposite side of the building, an enormous banner with Trump\u2019s face read: \u201cAmerican Workers First.\u201d",
      "Former miner and coal truck driver Randy Lawrence said both Trump and Kennedy should do an eight-hour shift underground to see why NIOSH and the silica rule are essential. He said he hopes to send a loud message to the president he voted for, but no longer supports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to hurt the working man,\u201d he said, lugging his oxygen tank. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worried about the miners or people in West Virginia or coal miners anywhere. All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old.

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",
      "A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war, as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of expensive missiles.",

      "European companies are now developing new technologies, including drone-against-drone systems like Merops and anti-drone missiles, while European Union countries have agreed to work together to create a \u201cdrone wall\u201d on the bloc\u2019s eastern border.",
      "U.S. military leaders in Europe are also advocating for the creation of an Eastern Flank Deterrence Line, a layered zone of defenses along NATO\u2019s border.",
      "The commanding general for the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa \u2014 and head of NATO\u2019s Allied Land Command \u2014 Gen. Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",
      "The Merops system has been chosen because it has been used successfully in Ukraine. If something doesn\u2019t work there, it\u2019s \u201cprobably not worthwhile acquiring,\u201d Lowin said.",
      "Drones are evolving rapidly, and each new type demands a different response: The challenge is to identify the threat and then almost immediately work out how to attack it, said Brig. Gen. Zacarias Hernandez, deputy chief of staff plans at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "That requires extremely fast production cycles \u2014 from development to battlefield within weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia is also mass-producing attack drones, equipping them with cameras, jet-propelled engines and advanced anti-jamming antennae.",
      "It, too, has been forced to adapt, as Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged in early October.",
      "Speaking about the military\u2019s initial failures in Ukraine, Putin publicly admitted that \u201cthere were entire fields where our knowledge was simply non-existent\u201d but claimed Russia was now able to field more advanced technology \u201cwithin a matter of days.\u201d",
      "Ukraine, NATO and Russia are in a game of technological cat-and-mouse, the NATO officials suggested.",
      "\u201cWe see what Russia is doing in Ukraine,\u201d said Hernandez. \u201cWe have to be ready for that.\u201d",

      "Deepfakes have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative artificial intelligence tools",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- In 2021, Danish video game live-streamer Marie Watson received an image of herself from an unknown Instagram account.",
      "She instantly recognized the holiday snap from her Instagram account, but something was different: Her clothing had been digitally removed to make her appear naked. It was a deepfake.",
      "\u201cIt overwhelmed me so much,\u201d Watson recalled. \u201cI just started bursting out in tears, because suddenly, I was there naked.\u201d",
      "In the four years since her experience, deepfakes \u2014 highly realistic artificial intelligence-generated images, videos or audio of real people or events \u2014 have become not only easier to make worldwide but also look or sound exponentially more realistic. That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission. A bill that's expected to pass early next year would change copyright law by imposing a ban on the sharing of deepfakes to protect citizens\u2019 personal characteristics \u2014 such as their appearance or voice \u2014 from being imitated and shared online without their consent.",
      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",
      "He added: \"We can\u2019t just pretend that this is business as usual for how we think about those key parts of our identity and our dignity.\"",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation in May that makes it illegal to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including deepfakes. Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.",
      "Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said that the bill has broad support from lawmakers in Copenhagen, because such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and spread misinformation.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to deepfake a politician without her or him being able to have that product taken down, that will undermine our democracy,\u201d he told reporters during an AI and copyright conference in September.",
      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",
      "Ajder said Google-owned YouTube, for example, has a \u201cvery, very good system for getting the balance between copyright protection and freedom of creativity.\"",

We are seeing it with pornography, and we\u2019re also seeing it also with famous people and also everyday people \u2014 like you and me.\u201d",

      "Household names like Chipotle and McDonald\u2019s cautioned about flagging purchases among low-income customers. The development could hold significant stakes for the wider economy, since consumer spending accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.",

      "The survey came days after data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed Americans\u2019 household debt levels have reached a record high.",
      "Here\u2019s what some major restaurant chains are saying about consumer weakness, and what it could mean for the economy:",
      "Chipotle",
      "Chipotle Mexican Grill, which operates thousands of U.S.-based stores, faulted consumer weakness for disappointing sales in an earnings report last week.",
      "Same-store sales, a measure of revenue generated at existing locations, is expected to decline in 2025, Chipotle said, reversing a forecast of sales growth made just months earlier.",
      "On an earnings call, Scott Boatwright, the CEO of Chipotle, pointed to \u201cpersistent macroeconomic pressures,\u201d saying the \u201cgap has widened\u201d between low-income and affluent customers.",
      "Customers earning an annual salary below $100,000, who account for about 40% of Chipotle\u2019s sales, are dining out less frequently due to \u201cconcerns about the economy and inflation,\u201d Boatwright said.",
      "Shares of Chipotle have plummeted more than 20% since the company released earnings last week, contributing to a 50% drop since the outset of this year.",
      "Sweetgreen",
      "Fast-casual chain Sweetgreen struggled in recent months, reporting a decline of nearly 10% in same-store sales over the quarter ending in September compared to a year ago.

      "The losses with low-income shoppers have come alongside a steady increase in prices. The average cost of a McDonald\u2019s menu item jumped 40% from 2019 to 2024, a company fact sheet said.",

      "And in California, where Democrats have asked voters to approve redrawing the state's congressional map as part of a national redistricting battle, the results will help shape next year's fight for the balance of power in Washington and control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "The stakes are high for both parties: A new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll, conducted using Ipsos' KnowledgePanel, found that two-thirds of Americans say that the country is \"pretty seriously off on the wrong track,\" compared to one-third who say it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That figure, while lower than the 75% of Americans who said the same at the same time last year, comes as 6-in-10 Americans blame President Donald Trump for the current rate of inflation.",

      "Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist, captured 78% of voters under 30 and 66% of those voters 30 to 44 in Tuesday's election, according to ABC News exit polls, conducted by SSRS. Among voters 45 to 64, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo edged out Mamdani, 53% to 47%. A majority of voters 65 and older (55%) voted for Cuomo while 36% voted for Mamdani. Additionally, newcomers to the city were some of the most likely voters in the state to vote for Mamdani, with 81% of those who have lived in New York City less than 10 years supporting him, the exit polls found.",
      "Along with his electoral success among younger and newer New Yorkers, Mamdani also earned support from 55% of voters who lived in the city for over 10 years, but were not born in the city. More of those who were born in New York City voted for Cuomo (49%) than Mamdani (38%), according to the exit polls.",
      "More first-time New York City mayoral voters also voted for Mamdani than those who have previously voted for mayor in the city, 66% versus 47%, the exit polls found.",
      "Greer said this accomplishment in gathering the majority of the youth's vote was through Mamdani's engagement in social media, along with the campaign's clear message about working as a community.",
      "\"This campaign, which was incredibly run, was clear and consistent that it's not just about beating someone else -- meaning the Republican Party or Donald Trump or Andrew Cuomo -- it was about an additive type of politics, where if we work together, we can collectively get more. I think that message resonated with a lot of people,\" Greer said.",
      "Additionally, Mamdani's focus on the affordability of New Yorkers -- specifically his plans to freeze rent for rent-stabilized apartments and provide universal child care and free buses -- \"resonated\" with younger generations, according to Jessica Siles, the senior director of communications for advocacy organization Voters of Tomorrow.",
      "\"I think New York has some specific affordability issues that maybe aren't everywhere in the country. When you are moving to New York, there are certain financial hurdles in some ways that make things difficult.

      "\"This needs to be a city for everyone and the fact that nearly half of New Yorkers from across the spectrum united against what the democratic nominee in an overwhelmingly democratic city campaigned on shouldn't be overlooked,\" Rich Azzopardi, a spokesperson for Cuomo, said in a statement to ABC News. \"We're proud of the campaign Andrew Cuomo ran in the general, a record 42% on an independent ballot line buried on the ballot.\"",

      "Despite Cuomo's favorability with native New Yorkers, Mamdani's ability to meet with voters across the city -- whether they are waiting in a taxi cab line or on the subway -- allowed for everyone in the city, including those who are new to the area, to quickly become familiar with his vision, Greer said.",
      "\"Whether it's a church or a club, he was there. He's on the subway. If you say you want to be mayor of New York, he's actually in lots of different places where people are,\" Greer said. \"It's reminiscent of Obama days -- at a certain point in time, it's not about the candidate, it's about the movement.\"",

      "\u201cFrom right now through my final seconds as mayor, I will work tirelessly to make our great city a place where everyone, regardless of who you are or where you come from, can build a brilliant life in an affordable home and a safe neighborhood,\" Frey said in a statement.

      "Fateh congratulated Frey on his win.",
      "\u201cThey may have won this race, but we have changed the narrative about what kind of city Minneapolis can be,\" Fateh said in a statement. \u201cBecause now, truly affordable housing, workers\u2019 rights, and public safety rooted in care are no longer side conversations; they are at the center of the narrative.\u201d",

      "The stylized font \u2014 with its drop shadow effect and vintage comic book look \u2014 was meant to evoke the old school, hand-painted signs that can still be found in some neighborhoods, he said.",
      "\u201cSuccinctly, it\u2019s New York,\u201d said Bhoopathy, who previously lived in New York and helped on past campaigns for Mamdani and the Queens chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America.",
      "It was also trendsetting.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s main adversary, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, even rebranded midcampaign. The Democrat initially launched his mayoral run using a red, white and blue color scheme and a decidedly unfussy font, reminiscent of bumper stickers used by President John F. Kennedy in 1960.",
      "But after his defeat to Mamdani in the June Democratic primary, Cuomo kicked off his general election run as an independent candidate by rolling out a new logo featuring the silhouette of the Statue of Liberty\u2019s crown and a new color scheme: blue and orange \u2014 Mamdani\u2019s colors, but also the colors of the Knicks and Mets.",
      "Mamdani, who will be the city\u2019s first Muslim and South Asian mayor, is the son of two prominent Indian American luminaries, Columbia University professor Mahmood Mamdani and filmmaker Mira Nair, who is known for \u201cMonsoon Wedding\u201d and other Hollywood films.",
      "The campaign\u2019s aesthetic wasn't merely stylistic, observed David Schwittek, a professor of digital media and graphic design at Lehman College, a city-owned college in the Bronx.",
      "\"They evoke the working-class fabric of New York City: the bodegas, taxi cabs, and halal carts that not only sustain the city but also reflect its cultural richness,\u201d he said.",
      "The decidedly retro vibe also likely helped foster \u201cpositive associations to happier political times,\u201d at least among Democratic voters, suggested Gavan Fitzsimons, a business professor at Duke University who studies the impact of branding on voters and consumers.",
      "\u201cIt has the feel of something from a prior era, an earlier time when politics was less divisive and the Democrats were perhaps more organized, more successful,\u201d he said.",
      "The branding was reminiscent of the distinctive campaign font that became a calling card for U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another youthful liberal New Yorker who shot to political fame, said Richard Flanagan, a political science professor at the College of Staten Island.",

      "Court Stroud, a marketing professor at New York University, said it\u2019s difficult to quantify how much the campaign visuals contributed to Mamdani\u2019s success, but they certainly made him recognizable and memorable in an initially crowded field of mayoral hopefuls.",
      "\u201cThe playfulness of his campaign design created a brand that supporters wanted to wear and share,\u201d he said. \u201cMamdani\u2019s team showed how using visual design as a secret handshake can make politics feel real and community driven.\u201d",
      "Campaign experts said it\u2019s also too early to say whether Mamdani\u2019s campaign designs will ultimately have the same staying power nationally as Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s distinctive look, which has since become a staple of progressive candidate branding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s still rare for candidates to move away from the tried and true red, white, and blue,\u201d said Lisa Burns, a professor of media studies at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. \u201cI don\u2019t see that changing any time soon.\u201d",

      "Schwittek said the key takeaway from Mamdani\u2019s visual coup was that effective branding isn\u2019t generic or safe, but specific and deliberate.",
      "\u201cIn a sea of sanitized political messaging, Mamdani\u2019s visuals stand out because they mean something,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the lesson.\u201d",
      "Good campaign design should also still ring true to the candidate, added Bhoopathy.",
      "\u201cNone of the boldness and vibrancy here works without a candidate that is as energetic and full of life as the city that raised him,\u201d he said.",

      "The lessons are often adapted from hunting safety courses already administered by state hunting and wildlife agencies, but with key differences.",

This is consistent with instructions created by other organizations, including one from the National Rifle Association that features animated characters, videos and coloring pages.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s molecular biology program, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview. Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later.",
      "From 1988 to 1992, he directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Yet he gained unwelcome attention in 2007 when the Sunday Times Magazine of London quoted him as saying he was \u201cinherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\u201d because \u201call our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\u201d He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \u201cpeople who have to deal with Black employees find this is not true.\u201d",
      "He apologized, but after an international furor he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. He retired a week later. He had served in various leadership jobs there for nearly 40 years.",
      "\u201cI only wish that Jim\u2019s views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\u201d Dr. Francis Collins, then-director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019.",
      "In a television documentary that year, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said.",

      "THE FACTS: This is misleading. While Walmart's 2025 meal basket costs about 25% less than the one from 2024, that's because it offers fewer items and different products that make it more affordable.",
      "\u201cIt's not apples to apples, right?\u201d said David Anderson, a livestock economist at Texas A&M University. \u201cWhat this does highlight is individual retailers\u2019 strategies for getting customers in the door.\u201d",

That's about a 25% decrease, possibly more depending on price fluctuations. John Furner, president and CEO of Walmart U.S., touted the savings in a LinkedIn post last month.",
      "But the baskets differ significantly. For example, this year's includes just 15 items compared to last year's 29. It is missing many dessert items, including a pecan pie, mini marshmallows and muffin mix, as well as savory items such as sweet potatoes, yellow onions and celery stalks.",

      "Investigators say a repeating bell sounded as pilots tried to control a UPS cargo plane upon takeoff before it crashed in Louisville, Kentucky, this week",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne when a bell sounded in the cockpit. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball, the chief investigator said Friday.",
      "The crash Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company\u2019s global aviation hub in Louisville, Kentucky, killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu.",
      "National Transportation Safety Board member Todd Inman said the cockpit voice recorder captured the bell that sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\u201cIt occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\u201d Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman\u2019s news conference. \u201cThey were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They\u2019ll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\u201d",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles.",
      "The NTSB clarified Friday that preliminary data on the aircraft\u2019s altitude indicated it got only about 100 feet above ground level, not 475 feet. It reached a speed of 210 mph (340 kph) before crashing just outside the airport, Inman said.",
      "The left engine\u2019s main component and pieces of fan blades were recovered from the airfield. Inman said UPS indicated no maintenance work was performed just before the flight. He noted investigators will look at video to see what, if anything, was being done around the MD-11 aircraft in preceding days.",

      "In a statement, Planned Parenthood officials described the lawsuit as a \u201cpolitically motivated attack\u201d aimed at further eroding access to abortion in Florida, which bans most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, before many women even know they are pregnant.",
      "\u201cAnti-abortion lawmakers and officials are relentless in their effort to end access to all abortion care, and to stop patients from getting accurate medical information.

      "WASHINGTON -- After voters swung toward Republican Donald Trump during last fall\u2019s presidential election, states like Virginia and New Jersey swung back towards Democratic candidates at nearly the same velocity as 2024\u2019s shift, an Associated Press analysis of election data from this week found.",
      "From populous suburbs to big cities to military-heavy counties, this year\u2019s electorate moved decisively towards the Democratic Party. Some of these areas had the largest shifts towards Trump last year, particularly in New York and New Jersey, but on Tuesday, the returns more closely resembled 2020 margins.",
      "This came alongside relatively high turnout, at least compared to recent off-year elections, suggesting that one pattern of the last decade in American politics \u2014 Republicans doing well when Trump is on the ballot, and Democrats doing better when he is not \u2014 continues to hold.",
      "The AP\u2019s analysis is based off county- and precinct-level data. In all cases, 2025 margins are as of 10:45 a.m. on Nov. 7. Additional votes will be counted as election officials tabulate late-arriving mail and provisional ballots. Here are some of the findings.",
      "Virginia and New Jersey, the two states that elect governors in the year following a presidential election, both have a tradition of moving against the party in the White House.",
      "Starting in 1976, every time a party has won back control of the presidency, Virginia voters have chosen a governor from the opposing party the following year. And in New Jersey, voters elected a governor from the opposite party of the sitting president in every election from 1989 to 2017.",
      "Democrats Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill continued this trend with double-digit victories.",
      "Spanberger\u2019s victory was especially notable for its scale. In the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial elections, the average margin of victory was 8.6 percentage points.",
      "Spanberger\u2019s 14.4-point win \u2014 coming a year after Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris won the state by just 5.8 percentage points \u2014 was bolstered by big margins in Northern Virginia, home to Washington, D.C., suburbs heavily affected by federal government cuts and the ongoing government shutdown. It also greatly exceeded former President Joe Biden\u2019s 10.1-point victory in 2020.",
      "These shifts helped Spanberger win 15 counties and independent cities that her predecessor, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, had won four years earlier. Six of those jurisdictions \u2014 Spotsylvania, Lynchburg, Nelson, Waynesboro, Prince Edward and Surry \u2014 also supported Trump in 2024.",
      "Spanberger also benefited from a spending advantage of around $27 million and Trump\u2019s reluctance to endorse her Republican opponent.",
      "In succeeding term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, Sherrill not only restarted New Jersey\u2019s history of voting for the party not in power but also broke a 60-year streak. No party has held the New Jersey governorship for more than three consecutive terms since the 1960s, when a two-term Democratic governor succeeded another two-term Democratic governor.",
      "Recent voting patterns in New Jersey suggested the governor\u2019s race could have been much tighter. And in addition to receiving Trump\u2019s endorsement, Republican Jack Ciattarelli kept pace with Sherrill in terms of spending.",
      "He also got close the election prior. Ciattarelli came within 3 points of ousting Murphy in 2021. And between Ciattarelli\u2019s 2021 and 2025 campaigns, Trump made massive inroads in New Jersey: He flipped five counties that Biden won in 2020 and cut the Republican margin in the state down to just 5.9 percentage points.",
      "Sherrill\u2019s 13.5-point win indicated a return to pre-2024 levels. While she fell short of Biden\u2019s 15.9-point win, she returned all five of the counties Trump flipped to the Democratic column. She also improved on Harris\u2019 margin in Bergen County, the state\u2019s largest, by more than 8 points.",

      "Virginia\u2019s turnout rate was just shy of 2021 levels as of Friday morning. It is not yet clear if turnout in 2025 will meet or exceed 2021 as ballots continue to be counted.",

While he did well in June\u2019s primary among neighborhoods with large Asian and Muslim populations, he generally fell short of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods.",

      "President Donald Trump has granted a pardon to a former New York police sergeant who was convicted of helping China try to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump granted a pardon Friday to a former New York police sergeant who was convicted of helping China try to scare an ex-official into going back to his homeland, a prominent case in U.S. authorities' efforts to combat what they claim are Beijing's far-flung efforts to repress critics.",
      "Michael McMahon was sentenced this spring to 18 months in prison for his role in what a federal judge called \u201ca campaign of transnational repression.\" He insisted he was innocent, saying he was \u201cunwittingly used\u201d when he took what he thought was a straightforward private-investigator gig. McMahon said he was told he was working for a Chinese construction company, not the nation's government.",
      "A White House official, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity to discuss a pardon that hasn\u2019t been publicly announced, pointed to McMahon's explanation that he'd been misled. The official also noted that McMahon earned dozens of commendations before a 2001 injury ended his 14-year NYPD career.",
      "McMahon's lawyer, Lawrence Lustberg, said the pardon \u201ccorrects a horrible injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI will always believe that it was the Chinese government that victimized Mike, a true hero cop, whom our government should have celebrated and honored, rather than indicted,\u201d Lustberg said by email.",
      "The Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors\u2019 office that brought the case declined to comment.",
      "A jury had convicted McMahon, 58, of charges that included acting as an illegal foreign agent and stalking. He was released from prison to a halfway house earlier this year and was back at his New Jersey home Friday, his attorney said.",
      "McMahon had gotten support from U.S. Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.J., and Pete Sessions, R-Texas. They wrote to the court last year to back McMahon's assertions of innocence and urge the judge to spare him prison.",
      "Lawler cheered the pardon Friday, writing on X that the former officer \u201cnever should have been prosecuted to begin with.\u201d A message seeking comment was sent to Sessions' office.",
      "McMahon was one of three men convicted at the first trial stemming from U.S. claims about China\u2019s decade-old \u201cOperation Fox Hunt\u201d initiative. His co-defendants, both Chinese citizens, also were sentenced to prison, where they remain. Messages seeking comment were sent Friday to attorneys for the men, who denied the charges.",
      "Three other people pleaded guilty in the case, and another five defendants remain at large, believed to be in China.",
      "U.S. authorities have viewed \u201cOperation Fox Hunt,\u201d in at least some instances, as a tool of \u201ctransnational repression\u201d \u2014 a term for sending government operatives to harass, threaten and silence dissidents living abroad.",

      "The case involving McMahon centered on a former Chinese city official named Xu Jin, who moved with his family to suburban New Jersey in 2010. The Chinese government has accused him and his wife of bribery. The couple denied the allegation and said he was unjustly targeted because of internal politics within China\u2019s Communist government.",
      "China has no extradition treaty with the U.S. so it couldn't legally compel Xu's return. Instead, U.S. prosecutors said, Beijing engineered years of creepy outreach and innuendo to try to induce him to come back.",
      "Hired by co-defendants to locate Xu, McMahon searched law enforcement and government databases and conducted surveillance. He and Lustberg acknowledged that McMahon missed \u201cred flags\u201d about the $11,000 job, but they said he was duped by his clients and didn\u2019t foresee that the information would be used to hound Xu.",
      "\u201cI never thought for one minute I was working for China, stalking anyone,\" McMahon said at his sentencing.",
      "Prosecutors and trial witnesses said Xu was subjected to a pressure campaign that included disparaging Facebook messages to friends of his adult daughter, a slew of letters to a relative in New Jersey and a startling visit from his octogenarian father, who was flown in from China to press his son to return.",
      "Finally, Xu's wife found a note on their front door that read, in translation: \u201cIf you are willing to go back to the mainland and spend 10 years in prison, your wife and children will be all right. That\u2019s the end of this matter!\u201d",
      "Xu said at the trial that before seeing the note, he thought the Chinese Communist Party's overtures were \u201conly a mental threat to me.\u201d",
      "\"However, when I saw that note, I realized that it had become a physical threat,\u201d Xu testified, through a court interpreter.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

Bad Bunny also became the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for song, record and album of the year in the same year, according to Variety.",

    "summary": "Actress Sydney Sweeney stars in a new film based on the life of Christy Martin, the former prizefighter whose biggest battle took place outside of the ring.",
    "story": [
      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

    "story": [
      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Ultimate Fighting Championship\u00a0mixed martial arts company has cut fighter Issac Dulgarian, days after his loss by first round submission to Yadier del Valle during Saturday's Fight Night prompted a probe of possible pre-bout irregular betting patterns.",
      "This makes the UFC the latest sports entity navigating a possible gambling-related integrity issue, joining Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association, which recently saw FBI arrests connected to a gambling investigation.",
      "Suspicious gambling activity was reportedly flagged after the odds on Dulgarian, the favorite, changed rapidly in the hours leading up to the bout, leading several major sports betting sites to stop taking wagers on the contest due to the betting patterns.",
      "The UFC said in a statement Monday: \"Like many professional sports organizations, UFC works with an independent betting integrity service to monitor wagering activity on our events. Our betting integrity partner, IC360, monitors wagering on every UFC event and is conducting a thorough review of the facts surrounding the Dulgarian vs. del Valle bout on Saturday, November 1. We take these allegations very seriously, and along with the health and safety of our fighters, nothing is more important than the integrity of our sport.\"",
      "The controversy may have played out in the Octagon. Cageside commentators Daniel Cormier and Michael Chiesa called the submission \"white belt stuff\" on air, implying that sloppy actions led to the loss.",
      "The integrity of specific UFC bouts has faced scrutiny before, most notably for contests involving former UFC veteran and coach James Krause. He was investigated for allegedly using his background in mixed martial arts to offer insights to offshore sportsbooks and bettors.

    "summary": "An auction house is set to take bids on some iconic Hollywood memorabilia, from the suit worn by the \"Elf\" himself, to Marty McFly's hoverboard.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The suit worn by Will Ferrell in the 2003 comedy hit \"Elf\" is going under the hammer at an auction of movie memorabilia in London this December, and the skin-tight green and yellow piece of Hollywood Christmas magic is expected to fetch over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "Bidding for the iconic suit, complete with the conical hat and matching tunic, will begin at 50,000 pounds, the equivalent of about $65,000, but it's expected to eventually sell for as much as 200,000 pounds, or about $261,000, when the hammer falls at the Propstore Winter Entertainment Memorabilia auction.",
      "According to the description on the Propstore Auction house's website, there are tags reading \"Mr. Ferrell\" on the inside of the tunic and the stockings, with \"Hero-3\" also handwritten on the tunic tag.",
      "The auctioneers say the belt also has \"Mr. Ferrell\" written on it in blue ink.",
      "Large movie productions often create several versions of the same props, but the term \"hero\" is typically used to describe the highly detailed iterations which are central to the plot and intended for close-up shots in the final cut of the movie.",
      "The suit going up for sale does not appear to be the same one that Ferrell wore to an NHL hockey game in Los Angeles just after Christmas last year, when he gave fellow sports fans a giggle by sitting near the ice looking disgruntled with a beer and a cigarette in the garish outfit.",
      "Another notable item up for sale in the December auction is Marty McFly's iconic hoverboard from the second and third installations of the \"Back to the Future\" trilogy, which is expected to sell for more than $156,000.",
      "According to the product description, it's the lightweight foam version of the prop, which actors used for scenes where their characters were seen carrying the boards, rather than a wooden version that Michael J. Fox and his fellow actors were seen riding in other parts of the movies.",
      "The example of the then-futuristic hoverboard does have some \"wear from use and age, including adhesive residue around the fastening strips, cracks in the foam, and paint chipping throughout,\" according to the auctioneers.",
      "The most valuable lot in the auction, however, will be the original prop used as Boba Fett's rifle in \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.\"",
      "The auction house says it is the only known example of the prop. Other stunt versions and castings were made for later movies in the franchise, but, according to Propstore Auctions, this EE-3 carbine blaster has been \"identified by its serial number and photo-matched by details on the stock, directly confirming its provenance.\"",
      "The blaster, which started its life as a genuine 1917 Webley & Scott No.1 Mark I flare pistol, is expected to fetch the equivalent of around $915,000 when it goes under the hammer.",
      "The three day auction begins on Dec. 5 and will feature other iconic film memorabilia including Indiana Jones' fedora, worn by Harrison Ford in the 1984 \"Temple of Doom\" movie, Obi-Wan Kenobi's lightweight lightsaber from 1999's \"Phantom Menace,\" and Jack Nicholson's stunt axe from the horror classic \"The Shining.\"",

      "\"It's a huge honor,\" Bailey, 37, told the magazine. \"Obviously, I'm incredibly flattered. And it's completely absurd.\"",
      "Bailey had audiences swooning as Prince Fiyero in his 2024 big-screen debut in \"Wicked,\" the popular movie musical in which he proudly urges fellow students to join him in his shallowness. The second half arrives in theaters Nov. 21.",

      "Bailey told Fallon the title was an \"honor of a lifetime.\"",
      "\"I'm sort of thrilled that People magazine have invited someone in - bestowed this honor on someone who can really cherish the value of a sexy man,\" he said.",

      "He's had plenty of stage credits since then, including starring in Shakespeare's Richard II in London earlier this year.",
      "Bailey, who has spoken openly about being a gay actor, founded The Shameless Fund, which helps to support LGBTQ+ organizations.",

    "story": [
      "Diane Ladd, the actress known for her Oscar-nominated roles in \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" has died, her representative confirmed to CBS News on Monday. She was 89.",
      "Her daughter, Laura Dern, said in a statement that she was by Ladd's side when she passed at her home in Ojai, California.",
      "\"She was the greatest daughter, mother, grandmother, actress, artist and empathetic spirit that only dreams could have seemingly created,\" Dern said. \"We were blessed to have her. She is flying with her angels now.\"",
      "Dern's statement didn't immediately cite a cause of death.",
      "In 2023, the mother and daughter told \"CBS Sunday Morning\"\u00a0that the two began taking daily walks in Santa Monica after learning that Ladd had developed a lung disease, believed to be caused by exposure to pesticides. Dern was told her mother only had six months to live.",
      "That's when the two had conversations that eventually filled the pages of \"Honey, Baby, Mine,\" their joint memoir named for an old folk song Ladd's father used to sing. They discussed everything, starting with Ladd's marriage and divorce from Laura's father, actor Bruce Dern, to her efforts to discourage Laura from joining the family business.",
      "\"She was only, like, 11 years old, and I said, 'Don't be an actress. Be a doctor, be a lawyer,'\" Ladd said. \"Nobody cares if you put on weight or your chin points when you cry if you're a doctor. They just want you to be the best you can be. But an actress? They care, care, care, care, care.\"",
      "But Dern said there was no stopping her from being in movies: \"No. It is all I knew.\"",
      "A native of Laurel, Mississippi, Ladd was apparently destined to stand out. In her 2006 memoir, \"Spiraling Through the School of Life,\" she remembered being told by her great-grandmother that she would one day be in \"front of a screen\" and would \"command\" her own audiences.",
      "By the mid-1970s, she had lived out her fate well enough to tell The New York Times that she no longer denied herself the right to call herself great.",
      "\"Now I don't say that,\" she said. \"I can do Shakespeare, Ibsen, English accents, Irish accents, no accent, stand on my head, tap dance, sing, look 17 or look 70.\"",
      "A gifted comic and dramatic performer, Ladd had a long career in television and on stage before breaking through as a film performer in Martin Scorsese's 1974 release \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.\" She earned an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for her turn as the acerbic, straight-talking Flo, and went on to appear in dozens of movies over the following decades.",
      "Her many credits included \"Chinatown,\" \"Primary Colors\" and two other movies for which she received best supporting nods, \"Wild at Heart\" and \"Rambling Rose,\" both of which co-starred her daughter. She also continued to work in television, with appearances in \"ER,\" \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Alice,\" the spinoff from \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" among others.",
      "Through marriage and blood relations, Ladd was tied to the arts. Tennessee Williams was a second cousin, and first husband Bruce Dern, Laura's father, was himself an Academy Award nominee. Ladd and Laura Dern achieved the rare feat of mother-and-daughter nominees for their work in \"Rambling Rose.\"",

    "summary": "The former Prince Andrew is set to lose his final military title, as King Charles continues shunning his younger brother over historic ties to Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, formerly known as Prince Andrew, Duke of York, appears set to be stripped of his last honorary military title as the British royals continue their efforts to distance themselves from King Charles III's younger brother over his links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"We've seen Andrew surrender the military positions that he's had and we're looking now at the one remaining position he has, which is the honorary vice admiral position, and we've got a process underway for that\" to be removed, Defense Secretary John Healey told Britain's Sky News on Sunday.",
      "In a separate interview on the same subject with CBS News' partner network BBC News, the defense chief said \"it's a move the king has indicated we should take.\"",
      "Mountbatten Windsor is the late Queen Elizabeth II's third child. He spent decades in public life as a working member of the royal family, but revelations of his historical ties to Epstein have turned him into a pariah figure. In 2016, he was named in a civil lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who alleged that Epstein paid her to have sex with the former prince on several occasions. Mountbatten Windsor has repeatedly denied the claims, but he settled the case out of court with Giuffre in 2022, for an undisclosed sum.",
      "That settlement failed to stanch criticism of the former prince and the resulting pressure on the royal family, however, as new information continued to emerge about his historic connections with Epstein in the wake of a damning 2019 interview\u00a0with the BBC's Newsnight, in which he defended his ties to the disgraced financier.",
      "In the years after that interview, right up until this year, amid revelations about correspondence between Epstein and the then-prince, the royal family appeared reluctant to intervene, allowing him to step away from public duties and to give up many of his titles and privileges of his own volition.",
      "Last week, however, in a landmark move, King Charles announced that his younger brother would be deprived of the title of prince and told to leave his 30-room, tax-payer-funded Royal Lodge home in Windsor.",
      "One of the few titles Andrew Mountbatten Windsor still holds is honorary Vice Admiral in the Royal Navy, which he received on his 55th birthday in 2015. It is unclear how long the process to remove that title, which defense chief Healy has now confirmed is underway, might take.",
      "The former prince had a 22-year career in the Royal Navy, including serving as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, and commanding the anti-mine vessel HMS Cottesmore.",
      "Asked about the ongoing scandal, President Trump told CBS News' Norah O'Donnell in an interview that aired Sunday on 60 Minutes that \"it's a terrible thing that's happened\" to the royal family.",

Jay Kelly is filled with regret. I mean, if I get hit by a bus tomorrow, I have no regrets. I've certainly made mistakes. I've certainly done some dumb things. But I took a big bite at the apple, and I really took big swings.\"",
      "\"Were there things that felt autobiographical?\"",

      "\"And that's the case for you?\"",

      "How? \"I pay people!\" he laughed. \"No, I designed it by surrounding myself with the same friends that I met when I was 20 years old \u2026 I talk to them every day.\"",
      "\"Do you go out of your way to understand that there is this perceived gap between you and others?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Clooney said. \"I didn't grow up around fame. I mean, my father was a newscaster in Cincinnati, Ohio. My aunt [Rosemary Clooney] was a famous singer, but I'd met her three times. So, when I met someone famous, I was always like, Oh my God! And so, I always try to remind people that, honest to God, this is the job that I do and that, you know, we're all fairly normal.\"",
      "\"Why is that so important to you?\" I asked.",
      "\"I think because I was raised not only that you treat everyone equally, but that everyone treats you equally as well.\"",
      "Clooney is pretty disarming, as we saw while setting up the interview. Asked if he wanted to check how he looked in the camera, he smiled: \"No, I don't care. I'm too old to give a s*** anymore.\"",

      "\"Oh sure, parts have changed significantly.\"",
      "He's 64 now, married to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin. The two juggle Hollywood glamour with social justice work through their foundation. They have eight-year-old twins, and the actor (once famously single) says family life suits him \u2013 another thing that sets him apart from this character. \"Fame, [Jay] actually does really well.

      "\"But you know everywhere you go, people watch you. Is it performative?\"",
      "\"Sometimes it's performative,\" Clooney replied. \"I mean, listen, you don't get caught picking your nose, you know? You have to be more aware than other people would be.\"",
      "I asked, \"You seem to have this desire to keep some things for yourself, but then you can also be very political and really stick yourself out there.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, yeah,\" Clooney said. \"I try to do it when I think I have a responsibility to it. My father always told me to challenge people with more power than you, and protect people with less power. One of the things you understand is, you can't take on every fight. You have to pick things. I worked on trying to help solve some of the problems in Darfur in the early 2000s. Failed. You fail more often than you succeed. But it doesn't mean you don't keep trying. We still work there, we're still involved.\"",
      "He also does not regret writing that opinion piece in The New York Times, urging President Biden to drop out. \"To not do it would be to say I'm not going to tell the truth,\" he said.",
      "While Clooney does not shy from public activism, he gets some help guarding his private life at the family's place in Italy: \"Italian towns adopt you, Like, people come up and say, 'Which house is George Clooney's?' They go, 'Hey, he doesn't live here, he doesn't.' They protect you.\"",
      "Right now, Clooney considers France home. \"We live on a 750-acre farm, and our kids run around. We wanted them to have something of a normal existence.\"",
      "\"And you find that on a 750-acre ranch?\"",
      "\"Well, you find it on a farm, and you find on a very small school and very sort of farming community. We found a real peace there.\"",
      "He prizes that peace. In the film, Jay Kelly is searching for what George Clooney already has: a sense of self and balance. Clooney really does seem to have it all.",
      "I said, \"If people say, What was it like being with George Clooney? One of the things I'm going to say is, well, I was sitting here sweating, and somehow he didn't seem to sweat.\"",
      "\"I don't sweat!\" Clooney laughed. \"It's a funny thing. I don't sweat much when I'm on camera, funnily enough. I don't know why. I put ice cubes under my arms!\"",
      "But like the rest of us, he still has to contend with the passing of time. \"I want to work, but I don't want to fill my life with work,\" he said. \"When I turned 60, Amal and I talked about it, and I said, 'Look, I can still play basketball with the boys, I can still hang out. But in 25 years I'll be 85. And that's a real number.'",
      "\"And things change, and it doesn't matter how many granola bars you eat; it catches you. So, we have to focus on making sure we work. We also have to have focus on spending time with the people we love. More time, because at the end of your life, you don't go, I wish I'd worked more.\"",

    "title": "Salman Rushdie on \"The Eleventh Hour\" and free speech",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salman-rushdie-on-the-eleventh-hour-and-free-speech/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:37:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The author talks about his first fiction published since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him; his own immigrant experience in the U.S.; and what happens when freedom of speech dies.",
    "story": [
      "Salman Rushdie recently turned up at a McNally Johnson bookstore near South Street Seaport in Manhattan. \"It's actually not particularly close to where I live, but I come here a lot,\" he said.",
      "He was browsing for his own books. His newest one, \"The Eleventh Hour,\" is his 23rd \u2013 a collection of short stories and novellas.",
      "Life has changed since the 2022 attack that nearly killed him. \"I think what has changed is, for public-facing things, then there has to be security in a way that there wasn't for 20 years,\" he said.",
      "On August 12, 2022, Rushdie was on stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., ready to speak, ironically about America as a safe haven for writers. A man lunged at him with a knife.",
      "His account of the attack, \"Knife,\" was published in 2024: \"I raise my left hand in self-defense. He plunges the knife into it. ... After that there are many blows, to my neck, to my chest, to my eye, everywhere. I feel my legs give way, and I fall.\"",
      "Rushdie lost the sight in his right eye. \"I can still read,\" he said, \"but I do find that I use iPads in a way that I never used to. Because there's light, and because I can adjust the size of the type. So, I never, ever, read a book on an iPad, but now I do.\"",
      "His left hand and liver were badly damaged, but he lived, which he considers \"a miracle.\"",
      "In May of this year, Rushdie's attacker, Lebanese-American Hadi Matar, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Prosecutors argued he was acting on the fatwa, the 1989 order by Iran's leader, the late Ayatollah Khomeini, to kill the author, claiming passages in his fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" insulted Islam.",
      "Recognized just for his fiction before, suddenly Rushdie was world famous (to some, infamous) for the fatwa. After nearly a decade in hiding, protected 24/7 by British security, Rushdie emerged and moved to New York, thinking times had changed. But he was wrong.",
      "Yet the author does not seem bitter or angry. \"I think that's who I am,\" he said.",
      "I suggested, \"Most people would say, well, this is a clear recipe for a life with PTSD.\"",
      "\"Well, I do have a therapist,\" Rushdie said, \"and I asked him at one point to list for me the symptoms of PTSD. And I said, 'But I don't seem to be having those symptoms, so what's wrong with me?' And he said, 'Well, it's because you're a bad-ass, that's the technical term.'\"",
      "The new book is the first fiction he's published since the attack.",
      "So, why \"The Eleventh Hour\"? \"Well, for a start, I'm 78,\" he said. \"For another thing, I had a fairly intimate encounter with death, you know, and got away with it. But it makes you think, you know? So, I thought this idea of running out of time was something I had on the brain.\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America\"",
      "\"Now you have entered the magic space of my childhood,\" the fictional narrator of one story says, as he takes a last walk up the hill to the neighborhood where the real Salman Rushdie grew up, in Mumbai, India (which he still calls Bombay). \"My relationship with the place is kind of elegiac now,\" Rushdie said. It's a relationship about something that has passed.",
      "He left India for an English boarding school at the age of 13. He left Britain after nearly 40 years there. He became an American citizen in 2016. Rushdie sees his place in the world through the eye of an immigrant.",
      "Asked what he felt after becoming a U.S. citizen, Rushdie said, \"I remember getting into a cab, leaving the office where I'd been sworn in, and being driven back through the streets of the city, and it felt different. I thought, Oh, I can belong. And it felt very good.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did the feeling that you had when you were sworn in as a citizen become fractured or altered based on what's happened since, both in public life in the United States, and to you?\"",
      "\"It's a hard time in America, but it's a hard time all over,\" he replied. \"If you think of countries as people, there is their better self and their less-good self. And it would be nice if this country were to remember its better self.\"",
      "\"The Eleventh Hour\" includes a ghost story, characters who get even, a writer who disappears. But the book is also political. He writes: \"Words such as good and bad or right and wrong are losing their effect, emptying of meaning, and failing anymore to shape society.\"",
      "The meaning of words matters to Rushdie, who has spent his entire career advocating for free speech, even though exercising it nearly got him killed.",
      "He said, \"The final story in the collection, 'The Old Man in the Piazza,' is kind of an allegory of that. In fact, free speech, to my great surprise, language itself, turned into a character, a female character. She just walked into the story and sat down in a corner, and I hadn't expected her at all.\"",
      "\"She is in fact a very old language, one of the oldest and richest\u2026\" he writes, in a story about what happens when speech is restricted. \"It's even possible, though it's hard for her to admit this, even to herself, that she may die. Nobody's listening. Nobody cares.\"",
      "Language abandons her corner, leaving people no longer able to speak:\u00a0\"We are at a loss to know how things will proceed. Our words fail us.\"",
      "\"That's pretty startling and scary,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Rushdie agreed. \"It's supposed to be.\"",

      "\"The Day After Yesterday\" by Joe Wallace",
      "Carrie + Bryan",
      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down. But it's the complete opposite. It's given me so much more courage and brought me to meet so many wonderful people.\"",
      "Bryan paused with a sigh and said, \"I'm bad at speaking. Sometimes I struggle at work. But I get through it. Pennies and nickels and stuff ... the register ... it drives me nuts! You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast. Sometimes I lose my train of thought. I used to be the wittiest person in the room, but I feel like it's kind of dimming for me. But I can still pull some jokes out.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",

It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through.

It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings.

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "story": [
      "UPS and FedEx said they are grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Kentucky.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport in Louisville killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "summary": "Fox Sports\u200b announced that it has hired former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to replace Mark Sanchez.",
    "story": [
      "Former NFL quarterback and TV analyst Mark Sanchez has been let go by Fox Sports a month after he was stabbed during a fight in Indianapolis.",
      "\"We can confirm that Mark Sanchez is no longer with the network,\" a Fox Sports spokesman told CBS News on Friday. \"There will be no further comment at this time.\"",
      "Sanchez, 38, has been off the air since police said he was stabbed during a fight with a truck driver outside an Indianapolis hotel on Oct. 4. The former quarterback was in Indianapolis for Fox's coverage of the Oct. 5 game between the Colts and the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Sanchez faces a felony battery charge, along with several misdemeanors, for what prosecutors have said was a fight over parking. If convicted, he could face a sentence of between one to six years in prison.",
      "Sanchez and Fox Sports also face a civil lawsuit filed by the driver, 69-year-old Perry Tole.",
      "Nick Sanchez Jr., on behalf of the Sanchez family, provided a statement to CBS News on Friday, saying: \"It's been a long month for Mark as he continues to recover from serious injuries while also grieving the loss of a close friend. While the recent news \u2014 and its timing \u2014 is understandably disappointing, our priority remains his continued healing and recovery.\"",
      "He continued: \"Mark deeply values his time at FOX and the exceptional colleagues he's had the privilege to work with. Those relationships are meaningful and will endure.\"",
      "Fox Sports announced Friday that it has hired former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to replace Sanchez as its No. 4 NFL crew. He will also team up with play-by-play announcer Adam Amin and sideline reporter Kristina Pink. Brees' first game will be Nov. 16.",
      "Brees retired from the NFL following the 2020 season after a 20-year career with the San Diego Chargers and New Orleans, including leading the Saints to their only Super Bowl title during the 2009 season.",
      "He joined NBC in 2021 as an analyst for Notre Dame college football games and was in the studio most Sundays for \"Football Night in America.\" Brees called a wild-card game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Cincinnati Bengals but noticeably struggled. NBC and Brees parted ways a couple of months later.",
      "Brees made a studio appearance during \"Fox NFL Sunday\" earlier this season and is slated to be an analyst for one of Netflix's two Christmas Day games.",
      "\"Drew is one of the best to ever play the game, and we couldn't be more excited to have his prolific credentials and unique insights as part of our coverage on Sundays,\" said Brad Zager, Fox Sports president of production & operations and executive producer. \"We're thrilled to welcome him to the Fox Sports family.\"",
      "Brees added in a statement that he appreciated the opportunity to join Fox and that \"I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insights I provide to the fans each Sunday.\"",
      "In his first year of eligibility, Brees is among the list of 52 modern-era players being considered for the 2026 Pro Football Hall of Fame class. Brees remains second all-time in league history in passing yards (80,358) and passing touchdowns (571).",
      "While Brees takes over, Sanchez's legal issues will go on.",
      "An Indianapolis judge scheduled his trial to begin on Dec. 11.",
      "A police affidavit alleges that Sanchez, smelling of alcohol, accosted Tole, who had backed his truck into a hotel's loading docks in downtown Indianapolis on Oct. 4. Tole claims in his lawsuit that Sanchez entered the truck without permission, then physically blocked and shoved Tole, who then doused Sanchez with pepper spray.",
      "When Sanchez advanced after being sprayed, Tole pulled a knife to defend himself, authorities said.",
      "Sanchez was hospitalized with stab wounds to his upper right torso, according to a police affidavit. A picture of Tole circulating online shows him in a neck brace on a hospital bed, covered in blood with a deep slash to the side of his face.",
      "Sanchez had a 10-year NFL career before retiring in 2019. He spent four seasons with the New York Jets and also appeared in games with Philadelphia, Dallas and Washington.",
      "He appeared on ABC and ESPN for two years before joining Fox Sports as a game analyst in 2021.",

    "story": [
      "Retailers are betting they can handle the holiday shopping rush with fewer additional workers.",
      "From Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, retail stores are expected to hire between 265,000 and 365,000 seasonal workers, down from the 442,000 seasonal hires companies brought on last year, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization.",
      "That would mark the lowest level of seasonal retail hiring in 15 years, according to the NRF.",
      "At the same time, the organization expects holiday sales to hit a record, surpassing $1 trillion for the first time as spending rises between 3.7% to 4.2%.",
      "The decline in expected seasonal hiring comes as the broader labor market is showing signs of strain, with some businesses across the nation holding off on adding new workers. At the same time, layoffs are accelerating, with job cuts this year through October rising to their highest levels since 2020.",
      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "A 208-year-old publication that farmers, gardeners and others keen to predict the weather have relied on for guidance has published for the final time.",
      "Farmers' Almanac said Thursday that its 2026 edition, which is already available, will be its last, citing the growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the book in today's \"chaotic media environment.\" Access to the online version will cease next month.",
      "The Maine-based publication, not to be confused with the even older Old Farmer's Almanac in neighboring New Hampshire, was first printed in 1818. For centuries, it's used a secret formula based on sunspots, planetary positions and lunar cycles to generate long-range weather forecasts.",
      "The almanac also contains gardening tips, trivia, jokes and natural remedies, like catnip as a pain reliever or elderberry syrup as an immune booster. But its weather forecasts make the most headlines.",
      "A goodbye piece titled \"A Fond Farewell\" says, \"The season we hoped would never come is here.\"",
      "In the piece, Editor Sandi Duncan and Editor Emeritus Peter Geiger say, \"We are incredibly proud of the legacy we leave behind and are filled with gratitude. We appreciate and thank our loyal readers, contributors, and partners who have supported us through the years. Though the Almanac will no longer be available in print or online, it lives on within you.\"",
      "Separately, Duncan wrote,\u00a0\"It is with a heavy heart that we share the end of what has not only been an annual tradition in millions of homes and hearths for hundreds of years, but also a way of life, an inspiration for many who realize the wisdom of generations past is the key to the generations of the future.\"",
      "In 2017, when Farmers' Almanac reported a circulation of 2.1 million in North America, its editor said it was gaining new readers among people interested in where their food came from and who were growing fresh produce in home gardens.",
      "Many of these readers lived in cities, prompting the publication to feature skyscrapers as well as an old farmhouse on it final cover.",

    "story": [
      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",
      "Fifteen of those airports are included on the\u00a0list obtained by CBS News of airports that will be affected by the 10% cut in air traffic. Some major airports, including those in Las Vegas and Charlotte, were not included in the data.",
      "Delays were more significant in some areas than others. Staffing shortages and weather conditions compounded delays in New York City last week. From Oct. 28 to Monday, fewer than 65% of flights arrived on time into the area's three airports. More than 81% of flights landed on time at the airports in September.",
      "Seattle and Denver's airports, on the other hand, have had more flights arrive and depart on time over the same timeframe than in September.",
      "In the first few weeks of the shutdown, the percentage of flights arriving or departing on time had not dropped significantly at most of these airports, the data shows. But many airports experienced their worst days last week. About 43% of cancellations from the shutdown's start on Oct. 1 to Monday happened in the last week of that timeframe.",
      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay. On CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said controllers are \"confronted with a decision: do I put food on my kids' table, do I put gas in the car, do I pay my rent or do I go to work and not get paid?\"",
      "The FAA has issued at least 125 ground delays or stops due to staffing issues since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, compared with 26 in September, according to a CBS News analysis of Air Traffic Control System Command Center Advisories. That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",
      "\"You will see mass flight delays, you'll see mass cancellations,\" he said. \"And you may see us close certain parts of the airspace because we just cannot manage it, because we don't have the air traffic controllers.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",

      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect a ruling in the case early next year.",

    "summary": "The FAA will reduce U.S. air traffic by 10% at 40 U.S. locations starting on Friday due to the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that it will update its schedule once the flight reductions begin so the carrier can notify customers of any changes \"several days\" in advance.",

    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition.

    "story": [
      "U.S. health regulators sent warning letters Wednesday to 18 websites selling counterfeit or unapproved versions of Botox and similar injectable drugs commonly used to smooth wrinkles.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",
      "In a press release Wednesday, the FDA said patients should only receive the drugs from health professionals who are licensed and trained to administer them. Patients experiencing signs of botulism should \"seek immediate medical care,\" the agency noted.",

      "Starbucks Workers United announced Wednesday that its members voted to authorize a strike as they push to secure a first contract that offers them better pay and more flexible hours. Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",
      "The strike would start at coffee shops in 25 U.S. cities, with additional stores later joining in if no progress is made, according to a spokesperson for Starbucks Workers United.",
      "\"The ball is in Starbucks' court,\" Michelle Eisen, a union spokesperson and barista at Starbucks, said in a statement.",
      "If the strike happens this month, it would mark the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News the company is disappointed that the union voted to authorize a strike instead of coming to the bargaining table.",
      "\"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Negotiations at a standstill",
      "Starbucks Workers United, which\u00a0started in upstate New York in 2021, has grown to represent more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, still a relatively small percentage of total Starbucks workers. Overall, the company has more than 200,000 employees working in 10,000 stores across North America.",
      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0recently told CBS News that he's open to talking with union members, but said that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",

    "summary": "The shape of economic growth this year highlights the widening gap between wealthy Americans and everyone else, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "To understand how Americans are faring economically these days, it's helpful to consider the eleventh letter of the alphabet.",
      "Experts describe the current U.S. economy as \"K-shaped,\" a reference to the divergent fortunes of wealthier consumers compared with people lower down the ladder. The upward-slanting stroke of the \"K\" represents the ongoing trend of strong spending and healthy income growth among upper-income Americans.",
      "By contrast, the letter's lower-slanting stroke points to the multiple financial strains facing low- and middle-income people, from stubborn inflation and prohibitively expensive homes to surging credit card debt and high health insurance costs.",
      "This bifurcation of the economy isn't a new phenomenon, with inequality on the rise since the 1980s, noted Mark Zandi, chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics. But the divide in income and wealth has grown more skewed since the pandemic, reflecting the \"growing gap between the wealthy and the well-to-do and everyone else,\" he said. \"It's taken off.\"",
      "Several trends help explain what's behind the emergence of a K-shaped economy.",
      "Consumer spending",
      "Consumer spending \u2014 which drives over two-thirds of economic activity \u2014 is growing overall in the U.S. These days, however, a large and growing share of that commercial activity is driven by upwardly mobile Americans. In the second quarter of 2025, the top 10% of income earners accounted for almost half of all spending, according to an\u00a0analysis of Federal Reserve data by Zandi.",
      "\"That group has always accounted for a much larger share of spending, but that share has risen significantly over time, and now is the highest it's ever been in the data,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Other data tells a similar tale. In September, spending by lower-income households grew 0.6% from a year ago, compared with 2.6% for higher-income consumers, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Bank of America Institute.",
      "Spending on U.S. luxury fashion was also up 8% year-over-year in October, according to the bank's data \u2014 another sign that wealthier households are driving spending.",
      "\"Younger, less affluent households are facing ongoing challenges, while older, wealthier consumers are driving overall spending growth,\" said Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Record stock prices",
      "Because much of their income is held in stock and other securities, affluent Americans have particularly benefited from this year's run-up in financial markets, which have notched record after record largely on the strength of investor excitement about artificial intelligence.",
      "A May Gallup\u00a0poll found that 87% of Americans who own stock live in households with incomes of $100,000 or more. The top 1% of income earners \u2014 who on average earn around $731,000 per year, according to personal finance site SmartAsset \u2014 own nearly half of corporate securities and mutual funds, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0data shows.",
      "A bullish stock market also benefits the millions of employees with 401(k), mutual funds and other investments, but does much less to lift the many Americans without such holdings, said Tuan Nguyen, an economist at RSM US, an audit, tax and consulting firm.",
      "\"For lower- and middle-income people, especially the ones that live paycheck to paycheck, the rally in the equity markets might not be relatable to them because they are facing higher inflation and lower wage growth,\" he said.",
      "Of late, better-heeled Americans have also seen stronger pay gains. According to the Bank of America Institute, the rate of wage growth for higher-income households in September rose to 4% year-over-year. Annualized pay growth for lower-income households as of August fell to 0.9%, the lowest since the financial giant started tracking the data in 2016, said Taylor Bowley, an economist at the Bank of America Institute.",
      "What lower-income people \"see from the grocery store, from the gas stations, is that prices are going up while their wages are not going up,\" Nguyen added.",
      "Lower-income households also face a toxic stew of inflation, credit card debt, student loans and mortgage loans, sapping their spending power. They also feel the pinch of a slowing job market more acutely than high-income groups, Zandi told CBS News.",
      "\"They may have a job, although if they lose one, they're having a harder and harder time getting back into the labor market,\" he said.",

Thousands of workers\u00a0also walked off the job\u00a0in December 2024.",

      "Starbucks Workers United originated in Buffalo, New York, in 2021 and now represents 9,500 workers in approximately 550 Starbucks cafes across the country.",
      "A union spokesperson confirmed that contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The group entered mediation in February, which ended two months later with Workers United rejecting Starbucks' contract proposal. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are noneconomic proposals.",
      "The union spokesperson said the coffee giant has since refused to come to the table with a new proposal that meets workers' demands, which is why negotiations have stalled.",
      "For its part, Starbucks says it has engaged in nearly 200 hours of negotiations but claims that Workers United ultimately presented union members with an incomplete outline of single-store contracts to vote on.",
      "\"Workers United only represents around 4% of our partners but chose to walk away from the bargaining table,\" Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson told CBS News in an email statement. \"If they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "What workers want",
      "The workers' demands are threefold, according to the union \u2014 increased hours and\u00a0higher take-home pay, as well as a resolution from Starbucks for what the union refers to as \"unfair labor practice charges\" for union busting.",
      "\"Too many baristas still aren't getting enough hours to pay the bills or meet the threshold for benefits,\" the union says in its statement of demands on its website.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has filed hundreds of unfair labor practice charges against Starbucks with the National Labor Relations Board, including over its dress code.",
      "The union has not specified the size of the pay increase it is seeking. Starbucks said employees receive $30 an hour in pay and benefits. Store managers, or \"coffeehouse leaders\" as they're referred to by the retailer, are salaried. The company contends that nearly 85% of its employees work their preferred hours.",
      "Limited impact",
      "Susan Schurman, a distinguished professor at Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations, said previous Workers United strikes have had a limited effect on persuading the company to return to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The basic problem is that not enough Starbucks stores are organized yet so that a strike inflicts serious financial or publicity damage to the company,\" Schurman said in an email.",
      "Last month, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol announced that the company was shuttering certain locations and cutting about 900 jobs. The closures affected 59 union stores, according to Starbucks Workers United.",
      "In a letter to employees at the time, Niccol framed the decision to close stores as part of a \"Back to Starbucks\" plan, an effort he initiated in 2024 to revitalize sales and foot traffic at the chain's coffee shops. The plan includes adding more personal touches to the customer store experience, like handwritten notes on Starbuck's cups.",
      "Starbucks Workers United has\u00a0openly questioned whether Niccol's strategy is working, whereas Starbucks has painted the plan as a success.",
      "\"The facts show that 'Back to Starbucks' is making the experience better for both customers and partners,\" Anderson said. \"We've invested more than $500M to improve our coffeehouse staffing, training, and support on top of offering the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 per hour for hourly partners.\"",

    "summary": "The USDA said it would provide partial food stamp benefits for November, but it's unclear exactly when participants will get those funds.",
    "story": [
      "A plan announced Monday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to provide partial\u00a0food stamp benefits for November during the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could offer a measure of relief to millions of Americans. Yet the move still leaves participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in the dark on exactly when they will get the funds.",
      "In a\u00a0declaration\u00a0submitted to the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, Patrick Penn, a Department of Agriculture official who oversees SNAP, said $4.6 billion in contingency USDA funds will be used to cover 50% of SNAP recipients' benefits.",
      "However, the USDA declaration said that procedural changes U.S. states must make in order to issue partial benefits could take \"anywhere from a few weeks to up to several months.\" A spokesperson for the USDA referred CBS News to a social media\u00a0post\u00a0from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, which also says benefits could take several weeks to arrive.",
      "It's unclear how long it will take some states to issue SNAP payments since this is an unprecedented situation, said Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute. The timing will depend on how fast states can adjust to issue partial SNAP benefits and relay that information to EBT vendors, she added.",
      "\"I would hope that states will move heaven and Earth to get SNAP benefits flowing as quickly as possible,\" she said.",
      "The White House referred CBS News to the Office of Management and Budget, which also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump wrote Tuesday in a Truth Social post that benefits will go out only when Democrats vote to end the ongoing government shutdown. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified at a press conference later in the day that Mr. Trump was referring to future SNAP payments.",
      "\"He does not want to have to keep tapping into an emergency fund and depleting it in the case of a catastrophe in this country,\" she said.",
      "With questions continuing to swirl around the SNAP program, attention has turned to how this uncertainty directly affects people on food stamps. CBS News spoke with three people about how losing access to federal food aid could affect them. They reside in states that have committed to sending emergency funds to local food banks to assist families enrolled in SNAP.",
      "Shatika Griffin, 45",
      "Buffalo, New York, resident Shatika Griffin, 45, said she relies on both SNAP and the Women, Infants and Children program,\u00a0to support herself and seven children, including an 11-year-old son who is autistic.",
      "\"I'm a single mom, so it's very frightening,\" Griffin said of missing out on federal nutrition assistance. \"All the kids know is, 'I'm hungry.'\"",
      "Griffin said she typically uses the $1,100 she gets in monthly SNAP benefits to pay for food staples she can stretch out for the month, such as spaghetti and canned goods. Without the money, she plans to turn to a local food bank.",
      "Although her mother helps with child care, Griffin said her support network is limited. \"Everything is falling on my shoulders,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Kelly Lennox, 64",
      "Baltimore, Md., resident Kelly Lennox has spent over 25 years working as a stagehand, building theater sets for arts groups including Artscape, an outdoor arts festival in Baltimore. For the last decade, she's also worked behind the scenes in film and TV as a studio mechanic.",
      "In May of 2024, however, a hit-and-run accident required multiple surgeries and left the 64-year-old Lennox unable to work. Without a stable source of income, Lennox said she relies on SNAP, disability and Social Security retirement benefits to pay the bills. She plans to return to work as soon as she's physically capable, saying she needs a job to help cover her medical expenses.",
      "\"Because it was a hit-and-run, I have all these medical bills to pay,\" she said.",
      "The $192 she gets in monthly food stamps helps her buy fresh produce at the farmer's market, Lennox said.",
      "After learning that SNAP funding was under threat because of the shutdown, Lennox said she pulled back on buying food by conserving the remaining food stamps on her electronic benefits card. She currently has $240 in food stamp payments, but plans on visiting a local food bank to make ends meet.",
      "\"I'm going to have to make use of the pantries and work with their schedule, because if I use actual money for food, it takes away money I need to pay for my residential parking permit, gas and union dues,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Kathleen Hurd, a 64-year-old resident of Detroit, is the main caregiver for her grandson and granddaughter and manages the family's SNAP benefits.",
      "She receives roughly $390 in monthly food stamps, which Hurd said she uses to buy staples such as hamburgers, rice and potatoes. High food prices in recent years mean the payment is insufficient to cover the family's food budget, Hurd told CBS News, noting the demands of feeding her 15-year-old grandson.",
      "With her SNAP payments temporarily suspended, Hurd said she's trying to take it day by day. \"I'm really trying hard not to stress out about it,\" she said.",
      "Hurd, who has arthritis and lupus, said she has used food banks in the past when money was tight. But more recently, long lines and her health issues have made it harder for her.",

She said the appeals court should resolve the pending motion \"with dispatch.\"",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it has already exhausted the entirety of a more than $5 billion contingency reserve, which was enough to provide only partial food assistance payments for the month. It warned that the additional $4 billion needed to cover the full allotments for low-income Americans would require it to dip into a fund designated for Child Nutrition Programs.",
      "\"Pulling billions of dollars from the Child Nutrition Programs would jeopardize those programs' ability to fully operate this year \u2014 putting at risk critical food-assistance initiatives relied upon by millions of children every day, and raiding a program that Congress did fund to instead extend one that Congress has not funded,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",
      "A USDA official notified states earlier Friday that it was working to comply with the district court's order to provide in-full the food benefits to Americans enrolled in SNAP.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision is the latest development in the legal battle over SNAP benefits that has unfolded over the past several days. The payments are used by recipients to purchase groceries, but the USDA said late last month that assistance for November would not go out because of the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "A group of cities and nonprofit organizations sued the USDA last week amid rising concerns that the lapse in payments would leave millions of low-income Americans hungry. U.S. District Judge John McConnell, who is overseeing the case, then ordered the Trump administration to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to the roughly 42 million Americans enrolled in the program for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",
      "The plaintiffs then asked McConnell for additional relief that would require the Trump administration to make full SNAP payments \"immediately.\"",
      "In a decision Thursday, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot \u2014 to do so. McConnell said comments from administration officials indicate that food benefits are being withheld for \"political purposes.\"",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the 1st Circuit, the Justice Department claimed that the judge's order \"makes a mockery of the separation of powers\" and directed the USDA to find $4 billion \"in the metaphorical couch cushions.\"",
      "Trump administration officials have said there was $4.6 billion available in the contingency fund to cover a partial allotment for November, and would need $9 billion to provide the full amount of SNAP benefits.",
      "Justice Department lawyers wrote in a filing that the judge's order to transfer funds from the second source of money would require it to divert billions from Child Nutrition Programs, which provide food assistance benefits to millions of children.",
      "\"Unfortunately, by injecting itself with its erroneous short-term solution, the district court has scrambled ongoing political negotiations, extending the shutdown and thus undercutting its own objective of ensuring adequate funding for SNAP and all other crucial safety-net programs,\" they said.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Sauer said that if left in place, McConnell's decision \"will metastasize and sow further shutdown chaos.\"",
      "\"To comply with yesterday's abrupt TRO, the government must transfer billions of dollars to SNAP and send that money to the States by tonight,\" he wrote. \"Once those billions are out the door, there is no ready mechanism for the government to recover those funds \u2014 to the significant detriment of those other critical social programs whose budgets the district court ordered the government to raid.\"",
      "But lawyers for the cities and nonprofits claimed\u00a0to the appeals court that Trump administration officials \"callously disregard\" the harm to them and millions of Americans if assistance is provided below the full level.",
      "They urged the 1st Circuit to not let the Trump administration \"further delay getting vital food assistance to individuals and families who need it now.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 08 Nov 2025 08:48:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued an interview conducted by a U.S. asylum officer last month did not amount to sufficient due process.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration late Friday urged a federal judge in Maryland to allow immigration officials to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0to the West African country of Liberia, saying the U.S. government has cleared the final legal hurdle in the deportation process.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been at the center of the national debate over President Trump's immigration crackdown ever since he was deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a federal immigration judge's order that barred his deportation to his native country. After being held in detention facilities in El Salvador for months, including a notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face federal criminal charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "While a trial on those criminal charges has yet to commence, the Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. a second time, proposing to send him to several far-flung African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and most recently, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion on Friday asking U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis to scrap a ruling she issued this summer barring the government from deporting Abrego Garcia, arguing all legal avenues to contest his deportation have been exhausted.",
      "On Oct. 28, the Justice Department said, a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Any additional due process steps for Abrego Garcia are unwarranted, the Justice Department argued.",
      "\"Petitioner's claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "The Trump administration submitted declarations from top U.S. officials asserting that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia will not be harmed there or sent to another nation where he would be persecuted. In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys, however, argued in their own court filing on Friday that the interview conducted by a U.S. asylum officer last month did not amount to sufficient due process.",
      "\"The Government insists that the unreasoned determination of a single immigration officer\u2014who concluded that Abrego Garcia failed to establish that it is 'more likely than not' that he will be persecuted or tortured in Liberia\u2014 satisfies due process. It does not,\" they wrote.",
      "His lawyers also argued the Trump administration's ongoing effort to send Abrego Garcia to Africa \u2014 instead of Costa Rica, which has agreed to offer him refugee status \u2014 is a form of retaliation. They noted the government offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said.",
      "The lawyers asked Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland, to prohibit the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia to Liberia \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the determination made by the asylum officer who interviewed him. They said that review should consider the possibility that their client could be returned to El Salvador after being sent to Liberia.",
      "Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally. In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to the MS-13 gang. The judge's bond denial, upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant whom the government deemed to be credible. Abrego Garcia has denied being part of a gang.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody later in 2019 after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" barring his deportation to El Salvador due to concerns he could be targeted by gangs there. However, he was also issued a deportation order based on his illegal entry into the U.S.",
      "Earlier this year, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE, before being deported to El Salvador in March, as part of a high-profile deportation effort that sent several hundred Venezuelan and Salvadoran men accused of having gang ties to the CECOT prison. The Trump administration conceded in federal court that the deportation had been a mistake due to the 2019 withholding of removal order but Abrego Garcia nevertheless remained detained in El Salvador for months.",
      "After being returned to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was held in federal criminal custody, pending the start of his trial. After a federal judge in Tennessee ordered his release from pre-trial detention later in the summer, he was able to see his U.S. citizen child and wife in Maryland over a weekend. But his freedom was short-lived. In late August, Abrego Garcia was instructed to check in to the ICE field office in Baltimore, where he was again taken into custody.",

      "CBS News has reached out to the CIA, the Justice Department and Brennan, and attorneys for Strzok and Page.",
      "Fox News Digital was first to report on Brennan, Strzok and Page's subpoenas.",
      "The FBI's investigation into Russian election interference \u2014 named \"Crossfire Hurricane\" \u2014 was opened in 2016 and was later taken over by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller. He eventually concluded that Russia sought to help Mr. Trump win and that the Trump campaign was sometimes \"receptive\" to Russia's help, but did not allege any illegal ties.",
      "Meanwhile, in early 2017, the CIA \u2014 then led by Brennan \u2014 and several other intelligence agencies assessed that Russia had tried to influence the election and \"developed a clear preference\" for Mr. Trump.",
      "Those findings have long infuriated Mr. Trump, who believes the investigations into the Trump-Rusisa issue were politically motivated and aimed at undermining him \u2014 an allegation the leaders of those probes have strongly denied.",
      "In recent months, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has declassified documents that she argues undermine the intelligence community's 2017 assessment, which she called a \"treasonous conspiracy.\"",
      "Brennan, in particular, is a longtime Trump foe. The president revoked Brennan's security clearance during his first term and has called him a \"political hack\" and the \"WORST\" CIA director \"in history.\" And Brennan called Mr. Trump's comments about election interference during a 2018 meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sweden \"nothing short of treasonous.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has also frequently lashed out against Strzok, who helped open the FBI's Crossfire Hurricane probe, and Page, an attorney at the FBI. The pair had exchanged text messages that were critical of Mr. Trump, according to a probe by the Justice Department's inspector general, drawing the president's ire.",
      "The origins of the Trump-Russia probe have been investigated several times.",
      "The Justice Department's inspector general found the FBI had a sufficient basis to open the investigation, and its decision wasn't motivated by political bias. But the internal watchdog did find several missteps over the course of the probe, including in its handling of search warrants for former Trump adviser Carter Page.",
      "Years later, Trump-era special counsel John Durham conducted his own investigation of the investigators. He was more critical of the FBI, arguing that the bureau's basis for launching the Trump-Russia probe was thin, though the only government official who was criminally charged by Durham was a former FBI lawyer who pleaded guilty to doctoring an email.",

    "summary": "A new documentary, \"Second Wind,\" highlights Ukraine's wounded veterans, following four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro.",
    "story": [
      "As Ukraine's war with Russia grinds into its fourth year, the country is contending with a staggering toll of wounded soldiers and civilians \u2014 and an emerging generation of amputees reshaping what survival looks like in a nation under siege.",
      "A new documentary highlighting the country's wounded veterans screened this week at the French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C. The film, \"Second Wind,\" follows four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, all severely wounded in combat, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro \u2014 an account of grit and perseverance that comes amid one of the largest waves of war-related amputations in modern European history, and that mirrors the country's struggle to rise out of conflict.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that around 380,000 Ukrainian troops have been wounded since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. International medical organizations estimate that between 20,000 and 50,000 Ukrainians \u2014 including soldiers and civilians \u2014 have undergone amputations, with the World Health Organization saying the total number could approach 100,000.",
      "The scale and severity of those injuries have put enormous strain on Ukraine's medical and rehabilitation systems, with hospitals and prosthetic centers operating well beyond capacity.",
      "Filmed by Kyiv-born director Masha Kondakova, \"Second Wind\" documents the physical and psychological rehabilitation of soldiers injured by mines, artillery fire and drone strikes before they undertook their climb up Africa's highest peak. Kondakova, who began filming on the front lines of the conflict in 2014, said she wanted to focus not on the war itself but on what follows survival.",
      "\"We didn't want to make a movie about the war,\" Kondakova said in an interview with CBS News at the embassy of Ukraine in Washington. \"That was not the purpose at all. It's about our simple people, simple guys and one girl who became heroes because they're constantly overcoming their personal limits.\"",
      "\"Just take one step, and you will find your second wind. Maybe not with the first step \u2014 but with the second, you will,\" she said.",
      "Kondakova, who previously directed award-winning films about Ukraine's female soldiers and de-occupied zones near Kyiv, said \"Second Wind\" completes a trilogy about resilience. \"My first movie was about women at war at a moment when women didn't have positions in the army as fighters, and then a short, fictional movie about youth stolen by the war,\" she said. \"This third one \u2014 from the trenches in the east of Ukraine to the summit of Kilimanjaro \u2014 is about the resilience of our defenders. About how our scars become our strength.\"",
      "Among them is Mykhailo Matviiv, a soldier who lost a leg to a Russian airstrike and has since returned to the front lines to work as a drone operator on the eastern front. In an interview alongside Kondakova, he said returning to the front was not a question of choice.",
      "\"I can't live a normal life while my brothers are still at the front,\" he said, through translation. \"The injury created some doubts because I don't want to hold anybody back. But this experience showed me I can still be helpful and useful, as if the injury were not there.\"",
      "Matviiv, who applied his own tourniquet when he was wounded, said he had witnessed enemy forces intentionally target one soldier in order to attract medics or evacuation teams, only to then strike a bigger group.",
      "He added that the film's purpose was not to seek pity but to motivate. \"It's to show that life doesn't end with an injury,\" he said. \"You just climb your own personal summit, step by step.\"",
      "The documentary has already been shown in Ukrainian military hospitals, where Kondakova recalls one of the most emotional moments of her career.",
      "\"We were downstairs in a top secret [bunker] because otherwise we could be a target,\" she said. \"I was sitting behind one of our defenders, very young, who had just had this experience of amputation but no prosthesis yet.\"",
      "\"People were crying or so emotional,\" she said, \"I had a feeling they were with [the film's subjects] for each joke, they laughed as if they were together.\"",
      "Ukraine's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Olha Stefanishyna, said at the screening in Washington that the film was an important reminder for Americans in particular of the value of continued U.S. support for Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "\"It is very important to me that Americans can see what the true spirit of freedom is, and why their support matters,\" Stefanishyna said. \"This film shows that our Ukrainians \u2014 despite losing their legs \u2014 continued to fight, and they carried that spirit to the top of Kilimanjaro.\"",
      "The film arrives as Ukraine faces a long-term rehabilitation crisis. The Ministry of Health has said demand for prosthetics, particularly bionic limbs, has gone up sharply since the start of the war. Medical facilities such as Superhumans Center in Lviv \u2014 one of the country's most advanced prosthetics facilities \u2014 are operating at full capacity, while thousands of soldiers remain on waiting lists.",
      "Kondakova and her team have since launched The Second Wind Project, an organization designed to connect amputees through sports and peer support. \"We want every wounded soldier to feel the shoulder of a brother-in-arms,\" she said.",
      "She said she hopes \"Second Wind\" can also help raise awareness among policymakers and potential donors. \"The process of prosthetics and rehabilitation is long and expensive,\" she said. \"We need not only money, but expertise \u2014 veterans, doctors, specialists who can share experience.\"",
      "For Matviiv, who said after the film's U.S. screenings he will return again to the front near Pokrovsk, where some of the most intense fighting of the war continues, the message is straightforward. \"We are still fighting,\" he said. \"Any limitations that we have, we keep going and we keep defending.\"",
      "\"Second Wind\" continues an international tour this month, with screenings scheduled in New York, London, and Paris.",

    "summary": "The leader of the influential conservative think tank is facing calls to resign and several staff members have left in protest.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, is in turmoil after its leader defended former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who interviewed white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes on his popular online show.",
      "The controversy has led to several resignations as the think tank \u2014 which spearheaded Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint meant to guide President Trump's second administration \u2014 addresses the fallout.",
      "What Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts said in defense of Tucker Carlson",
      "As Carlson was criticized by conservatives for giving Fuentes a platform, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts stepped in to defend Carlson, pushing back on speculation that the think tank was distancing itself from its \"close friend\" and decrying the \"venomous coalition\" attacking the former cable news host.",
      "\"The Heritage Foundation didn't become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won't start doing that now,\" Roberts said in a video shared on Oct. 30.",
      "\"Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,\" he continued. \"I disagree with and even abhor things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either.\"",
      "Resignations over Roberts' remarks defending Carlson",
      "Over the following week, at least five members of the Heritage Foundation's antisemitism task force have resigned in protest over Roberts' initial social media post, CBS News has confirmed. Roberts' chief of staff also resigned after initially pushing back online, saying internal critics were \"virtue signaling\" and suggesting they should resign \"if so outraged\" over the comments.",
      "Economist Stephen Moore, the co-founder of the conservative organization Club for Growth, announced Thursday that he is resigning from his Heritage Foundation position as senior visiting fellow after 12 years in the role. A source familiar with his decision pointed to the controversy over Roberts' defense of Carlson and the ensuing backlash.",
      "Fuentes has a history of incendiary comments",
      "Fuentes, who found popularity in the far-right movement in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has a history of making antisemetic, misogynistic and racist comments.",
      "The 27-year-old political commentator has claimed the Holocaust was \"exaggerated,\" \"a lot of women want to be raped\" and White people are \"justified\" in being racist.",
      "Fuentes and his far-right online followers, who refer to themselves as \"groypers,\" have existed on the fringes of right-wing politics. Mr. Trump hosted Fuentes and rapper Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022. But in an interview with \"Face the Nation\" in 2024, Vice President JD Vance disavowed Fuentes, who has questioned his loyalty to \"white identity,\" citing his interracial marriage.",
      "\"Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?\" Fuentes said.",
      "Vance responded on \"Face the Nation\" last year by calling Fuentes a \"total loser\" and saying his philosophy \"doesn't have any room in the MAGA movement.\"",
      "Fallout at Heritage over Roberts' defense of Carlson",
      "Roberts' comments drew condemnation from prominent conservatives like former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and commentator Ben Shapiro, who said the remarks \"betray the legacy of Heritage.\"",
      "On Oct. 31, in a lengthy post, Roberts elaborated on his comments about Fuentes, saying the Heritage Foundation denounces Fuentes' \"vicious antisemitic ideology, his Holocaust denial, and his relentless conspiracy theories that echo the darkest chapters of history\" and is \"disgusted\" by several of his other stances.",
      "\"Our task is to confront and challenge those poisonous ideas at every turn to prevent them from taking America to a very dark place. Join us \u2014 not to cancel \u2014 but to guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation, and be confident as I am that our best ideas at the heart of western civilization will prevail,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "This week, Roberts faced intense criticism during an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, according to video of the nearly two-hour event obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Some staff members called for Roberts' resignation and questioned his ability to continue to lead the organization.",
      "One attendee said she and others have no confidence in Roberts' leadership after the events of the last week and that he showed \"a stunning lack of both courage and judgment.\" Another attendee said \"enormous damage\" has been done to the Heritage Foundation's reputation.",
      "Roberts apologized while also blaming his now-former chief of staff for the original video, saying the former employee \"had the pen\" and had been made to believe that the script had been approved by a handful of other Heritage colleagues.",
      "\"I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution,\" Roberts said. \"And I am sorry for that. Period. Full stop.\"",
      "He also apologized for using the phrase \"venomous coalition,\" which is seen as an antisemitic trope, calling it \"a terrible choice of words.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/latino-voters-swing-toward-democrats-in-2025-after-trumps-2024-historic-gains/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 18:55:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Mikie Sherrill flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters and won Latino men and women in her race for New Jersey governor.",
    "story": [
      "Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, largely reversing historic gains President Trump made in 2024 with this key demographic.",
      "Mr. Trump was a factor for voters generally, across Virginia, New Jersey, and California, according to CBS News exit polls \u2014 many said they voted in these races to oppose him.",
      "In New Jersey, 68% of Latino voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill, helping her defeat Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump. Sherrill carried Latino men and women alike, and even flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters.",
      "Every New Jersey county voted more Democratic than in the 2024 presidential election. And Democrats swept the 10 counties where Latinos make up at least 20% of the population, expanding on their 2024 margins and flipping counties that Mr. Trump won in 2024.",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump made significant inroads in heavily Latino cities like Passaic with a 70% Latino population. He increased his vote margin by over 30 points and flipped the county, becoming the first Republican to win the presidential vote there in over 30 years.",
      "This year, these communities swung hard the other way, reversing Republican gains. Passaic flipped back to the Democratic column, giving Sherrill the same vote share Joe Biden enjoyed there in 2020. And in both Paterson and heavily Latino Prospect Park, Sherrill did even better.",
      "\"The thing that stands out the most to me is the amount of swing from Republican to Democrat in just one year,\" said Chuck Rocha a Democratic political strategist and CBS News contributor. \"We saw the swing of Latinos to the right slowly, progressively over the last 10 to 12 years, but on Tuesday night it was a real snapback \u2014 almost back to pre-Trump numbers of Latino performances for Democrats.\"",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump received a higher percentage of the Latino vote than any other Republican presidential candidate in history. He won 46% of the Latino vote, coming very close to former Vice President Kamala Harris' vote share of 51%, according to CBS News exit polling. This was a dramatic improvement from Mr. Trump's showing of 28% in 2016.",
      "A precinct-level analysis of Passaic County reveals the types of places that shifted dramatically. About 16% of the county's precincts flipped from backing Mr. Trump last year to Sherrill this year, with no flips in the other direction.",
      "Moreover, it was areas with larger Latino populations that saw the biggest swings left. While some Latino Trump voters switched to vote Democratic this year, these shifts are also due to changes in turnout. Places with more Latinos saw greater churn in the electorate: that is, more of their 2024 voters skipped voting this year, and many of them were replaced with new voters who didn't vote last year (according to voter file data on this year's advance voters).",
      "Across the three cities mentioned above, along with Clifton, wards with more Latino residents both saw more churn and shifted more toward Democrats. Taken together, these data points and CBS News exit polling suggest that many of Trump's Latino voters stayed home, while others switched sides, and new voters broke heavily Democratic.",
      "In Virginia, Hispanic voters also swung for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who won 67% of their vote across the state. Mr. Trump made large gains in Manassas and Manassas Park in 2024, which are more than 40% Latino. In 2025, these two areas turned out for Spanberger.",
      "\"Certainly with the Latino community, economic issues, kitchen table issues, are always front of mind and always center in the decisions they're making,\" said Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin of the appeal of Democratic candidates to Latinos. \"You add on top of that, the fact that for many parts of this country, the Latino community has been terrorized with these mass thugs from ICE going out and indiscriminately pulling Latino from their cars.\"",
      "According to CBS News exit polls, 65% of Virginia Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their highest priority.",
      "In New Jersey, 57% of Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, and 53% feel the economy is not in good shape. On immigration, six in 10 Latinos feel the president's immigration actions have gone too far, and a similar number say the state's next governor should not cooperate with him.",
      "\"I predicted this was going to happen once the economy did not improve and once they started not deportation \u2014 but once they started deportations of non-criminal aliens and racial profiling \u2014 that there was gonna be a snapback,\" said Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who campaigned for both Spanberger and Sherrill.",
      "\"It's the same thing I saw in Arizona once there was racial profiling with Sheriff Joe Arpaio. You saw a mass mobilization of Latinos going out to not just protect themselves or protect their families,\" Gallego told CBS News, making reference to the former Maricopa County sheriff and anti-immigration hardliner. In 2024, Gallego won his U.S. Senate race, becoming Arizona's first Latino senator, as Mr. Trump won the state that year, largely on the strength of his outsized support from Latino male voters.",
      "In a recent UnidosUS bipartisan survey, 41% said they feared they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents, despite having legal status.",
      "\"Unfortunately Latinos are leaving the Republican party after giving us a monumental chance in 2024,\" GOP Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said in a video posted on X after Tuesday's elections. She called the results \"a wake up call\" for the Republicans.",
      "\"I've said it before, the Hispanic vote is not guaranteed: Hispanics married President Trump, but they're only dating the GOP,\" Salazar said.",
      "The president said Wednesday, \"I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" regarding the election results. \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.\"",
      "The 2025 races garnered national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about Mr. Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of the next year's pivotal midterm elections.",
      "Republicans have engaged in mid-decade redistricting in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, at the behest of Mr. Trump, trying to boost GOP chances of winning seats and retain control over the House of Representatives.",
      "In Texas, Republicans redrew five Democratic congressional districts \u2014 including two in South Texas that will be competitive in 2026. Former Republican Rep. Mayra Flores is running for one of the newly drawn seats, Congressional District 34, and says she hopes to compound Mr. Trump's 2024 historic gains.",
      "In a phone interview, she praised Mr. Trump's second term, but said, \"Our focus needs to continue on bringing down the cost of living and improving the economy because the American people are struggling to live.\"",
      "Flores says Latino voters in South Texas largely supported Mr. Trump in 2024 because they wanted more border security, and she believes the GOP will be able to hold onto their votes next year.",
      "In the 2025 fiscal year, which just ended in September, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, as a result of the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "\"We see firsthand what it looks like not to have law and order, and that is why Hispanics voted for President Trump,\" Flores said. \"We wanted law and order and continue to want law and order now more than ever.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
      "The motion, which had been expected, argues the case against James was driven by personal \"animus\" that arose out of James' civil fraud lawsuit against President Trump and his companies in her capacity as state attorney general.",
      "\"This lawsuit, and AG James' outspoken criticism of the President, triggered six years of targeted attacks. President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state's attorney general,\" lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.",
      "The name-calling by Mr. Trump includes describing her as \"crooked,\" \"scum,\" \"a monster\" and \"criminal,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing is similar to one from another of Mr. Trump's perceived adversaries, former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Comey has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.",
      "James is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a \"tool of revenge.\"",
      "To bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny \"while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.\"",
      "They say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the alleged conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was accused of identifying three houses as his first home.",
      "\"The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Like Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who was named to the post by Mr. Trump after the resignation of former acting U.S. attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "After Siebert's resignation, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote that the administration \"can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" adding: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "Friday's court filing criticized Halligan's ascension to the job, writing that \"the President removed what he viewed as the final roadblock to his plan\u2014interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014and installed his own lawyer, Ms. Halligan, with the singular mission of churning out indictments against his political enemies. Ms. Halligan promptly obeyed.\"",
      "Comey and James are separately challenging their indictments on the grounds that Halligan was illegally named to her job.",
      "James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general.",
      "James has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump's, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements.

      "Congressional Democrats have written at least eight letters seeking information about President Trump's $300 million ballroom project. So far, those oversight requests have yielded few substantive responses from the administration and a nonprofit involved in the project.",
      "The top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, Rep. Robert Garcia of California, received no response to his letter seeking architectural plans, budgets and a donor list, according to committee staffers.",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff has been similarly ignored. His letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles regarding donors and ethics concerns went unanswered.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts sought details around the ballroom's financing. In a letter to the National Park Service and the Trust for the National Mall, Warren requested the \"source and amount of any donations or pledges\" and questioned the ballooning cost of the project.",
      "Catherine Townsend, president and CEO of the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall, responded to Warren in a letter, explaining that the Trust \"is managing the private donations gifted to support the project,\" but it's not involved in the ballroom's planning or design.",
      "Townsend said the trust complies with federal nonprofit laws but \"donor names and identifying information are not subject to public disclosure\u2026and we strictly adhere to those confidentiality requirements to protect our donors' privacy.\"",
      "The National Park Service did not reply to Warren's inquiry, according to her office. Townsend referred further questions to the White House.",
      "\"If the Trust for the National Mall has become a tool for favor-seeking between billionaires and the President of the United States, the American people deserve to know,\" Warren said. \"I'll keep pushing to find out if the Trust is facilitating wink-and-nod arrangements between Trump and his billionaire ballroom donors \u2014 and what these donors are getting in return.\"",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power, so their letters amount to requests for information. The White House may volunteer information in response, but it's under no legal obligation to comply. It was not immediately clear whether the government shutdown has impacted the White House's ability to respond to congressional outreach.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states Friday that it is working to comply with a federal judge's order to provide full food benefits to roughly 42 million Americans through November, an agency official said.",
      "Patrick Penn, deputy undersecretary of Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, said in new guidance\u00a0issued to state agencies that the USDA is \"working towards implementing November 2025 full benefit issuances in compliance with\" an order from U.S. District Judge John McConnell issued Thursday.",
      "Penn said in the guidance that \"later today,\" the Trump administration \"will complete the processes necessary to make funds available\" to cover November benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in full.",
      "The notification comes as the Justice Department has appealed the judge's order requiring the administration to provide full assistance to Americans who use the allotments to purchase groceries. The Justice Department has also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to block his order and requested a decision on its bid for emergency relief by 4 p.m.",
      "McConnell is overseeing a lawsuit brought by a group of cities and nonprofits after the USDA informed states late last month it would halt food assistance for November to Americans enrolled in the nutrition program because of the ongoing government shutdown. He\u00a0ordered the Trump administration\u00a0last week to dip into a contingency fund to provide food aid to SNAP recipients for November.",
      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",
      "The plaintiffs then asked McConnell for additional relief that would require the Trump administration to make full SNAP payments \"immediately.\"",
      "In his latest decision, McConnell accused the government of undermining the \"intent and the effectiveness\" of his earlier order to distribute the aid to SNAP beneficiaries as soon as possible. He pointed to a social media post from President Trump on Tuesday, in which the president said benefits would be given \"only when the Radical Left Democrats open up government, which they can easily do, and not before!\"",
      "Amid confusion as to whether the president was signaling the administration would not follow McConnell's initial order to use the contingency funds, the White House clarified that it is complying with it.",
      "Still, the judge said the Trump administration had to provide the full SNAP payments and pull from two sources \u2014 the contingency fund and a different pot used for Child Nutrition programs \u2014 to do so. McConnell said comments from administration officials indicate that food benefits are being withheld for \"political purposes.\"",

Prosecutors said Cothren, with support from Casada, listed a fake name on tax documents for a political consulting firm that received the funds. Cothren was sentenced to 2.5 years in prison.",
      "\"The defendants abused their power as government officials and defrauded taxpayers for their own enrichment,\" Matthew Galeotti, head of the Justice Department Criminal Division,\u00a0said\u00a0after the September sentencing. \"The Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who betray public trust.\"",
      "But the White House said Friday that the Justice Department under former President Joe Biden had \"significantly over-prosecuted these individuals for a minor issue involving constituent mailers \u2014 which were billed at competitive prices, never received a complaint from legislators, and resulted in a net profit loss of less than $5,000.\"",
      "Casada's attorney Ed Yarbough said he was still waiting for the pardon paperwork, but Mr. Trump had called Casada on Thursday to give him the news that he would be granted a full pardon. The call came days before Casada was supposed to report to prison to serve his sentence.",
      "Casada resigned as speaker in 2019 amid multiple scandals that were not related to the corruption charges, including reports he had exchanged sexually explicit texts about women with Cothren.",
      "Cothren resigned shortly before Casada, after sexual, racist and drug-fueled texts he had sent were published by News Channel 5 in Nashville and other outlets. He also admitted\u00a0that he had used cocaine in a state legislative office building while in a previous job.",
      "During his second term, Mr. Trump has pardoned several Republican lawmakers who were convicted of fraud or corruption. In mid-October, he commuted the sentence\u00a0of former New York Rep. George Santos, who was serving over seven years in prison for wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. In May 2025, Mr. Trump pardoned former New York Rep.

    "summary": "The agreement with the Trump administration will \"immediately restore and continue the university's research funding,\" Cornell University's president said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Cornell University has reached an agreement\u00a0with the Trump administration to restore federal funding, with the university to pay $30 million directly to the federal government to put an end to claims by the Justice Department. Cornell will also invest $30 million in U.S. agriculture research.",
      "Cornell is one of the many universities the Department of Education warned it was investigating for potential Title VI violations related to antisemitic harassment and discrimination amid campus protests over the war in Gaza. It was also one of the schools officials were investigating over how it considers race in the admissions process.",
      "\"The Trump Administration has secured another transformative commitment from an Ivy League institution to end divisive DEl policies,\" Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a statement Friday, calling it \"a huge win in the fight to restore excellence to American higher education and make our schools the greatest in the world.\"",
      "The University of Virginia also recently reached an agreement with the Trump administration that resulted in the administration dropping probes into the university.",
      "Cornell President Michael I. Kotlikoff shared news of the deal Friday in\u00a0a letter\u00a0addressed to the Cornell community. He said \u00a0research funding will be \"immediately restored\" after more than $250 million in federal funding interruptions since April, which he said \"disrupted the research of faculty and students across all campuses.\"",
      "He noted, \"The resolution is explicit that Cornell's agreement to these terms is not an admission of wrongdoing.\"",
      "In return for the payments, to be made over three years, the federal government agreed to close all investigations and reviews into Cornell.",
      "\"Cornell has not been found in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in any of the investigations or compliance reviews of the university's program,\" Kotlikoff's letter said. \"The government has further agreed to restore terminated federal grants, release all withheld funds for active grants, and consider Cornell fully eligible for new grants and funding awards, without disadvantage or preference.\"",
      "Cornell also agreed to provide the government with \"relevant anonymized admissions data for statistical analyses,\" including data on race, grade point averages and performance on standardized tests. It agreed to utilize Justice Department resources for anti-discrimination training and will conduct annual surveys on the campus climate for students.",
      "\"Recipients of federal funding must fully adhere to federal civil rights laws and ensure that harmful DEI policies do not discriminate against students,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement.",
      "Kotlikoff said the agreement \"explicitly recognizes Cornell's right to independently establish our policies and procedures, choose whom to hire and admit, and determine what we teach, without intrusive government monitoring or approvals.\"",

    "summary": "Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, introduced legislation to restore funding to Head Start programs as some have been forced to close because of the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin introduced a bill Friday to restore funding for Head Start programs during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "\"My bill would give families certainty that Head Start and the care it provides will continue,\" Baldwin said in a statement provided exclusively to CBS News. \"If my Republican colleagues don't want to sit down and talk about saving 22 million Americans from skyrocketing health care costs, I hope they can at least agree that 750,000 children and their families shouldn't pay the price for Washington dysfunction.\"",
      "The Keep Head Start Funding Act of 2025 would ensure that programs could keep operating even if Congress hasn't passed new appropriations bills. It would retroactively take effect from Sept. 30 \u2014 immediately before government funding lapsed and the shutdown began.",
      "At least 140 Head Start programs, serving 65,000 children, have not received federal funding to renew grants in October or early November, according to the National Head Start Association. As of Nov. 1, the organization says 20 programs have partially or fully closed as a result of the shutdown, affecting nearly 10,000 children.",
      "\"Simply put, there is broad bipartisan, bicameral support for Head Start in Congress, because it works,\" said Yasmina Vinci, executive director of the National Head Start Association.",
      "This month, the Southwestern Wisconsin Community Action Program\u00a0shuttered its Head Start program, impacting more than 300 children. Even if the shutdown ends, Head Start director Tawny Hardyman told CBS News she expects the program could remain closed through the end of the year.",
      "\"My main concern is for the well being of the children and families,\" Hardyman explained. \"Once they come to their resolution, then the federal workers that support the Head Start grants have to be recalled back to work and they have to process our applications.\"",
      "\"What we have told staff is to be prepared, possibly through the rest of this calendar year until December 31st,\" she said.",
      "Other programs have been granted a temporary reprieve. In Tallahassee, Florida, the Capital Area Community Action Agency has relied on donations and a patchwork of support from local schools and churches to keep most of its Head Start programs afloat through mid-November. Once that is exhausted, the program, which has 378 children enrolled, could be forced to close.",
      "\"As far as having the money to run the operation, pay employees, things of that nature, we won't have that,\" said Head Start director Darrel James.",
      "James welcomed news of Baldwin's bill, given the uncertainty of the government funding impasse, now in its 38th day.",
      "\"We are definitely concerned that it could be a lot longer,\" James said. \"That's the scary part.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter on Thursday to the former Prince Andrew, now Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, requesting that the disgraced British royal appear before Congress for questioning over his former ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr. Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,\" said the letter, which was signed by the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, and 14 others.",
      "\"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation. In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you cooperate with the Committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the Committee,\" the American lawmakers said.",
      "Neither Garcia nor the committee has the power to subpoena Andrew, who was formally stripped of the title of prince on Thursday.",
      "No Republicans on the House committee signed the letter.",
      "The communication cited Andrew's widely reported friendship with Epstein, which continued after the American financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution. It also mentioned Andrew's visits to Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Epstein's trip to the late Queen Elizabeth II's residence at Balmoral in Scotland.",
      "\"This close relationship with Mr. Epstein, coupled with the recently revealed 2011 email exchange in which you wrote to him 'we are in this together,' further confirms our suspicion that you may have valuable information about the crimes committed by Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators,\" the letter said.",
      "It also cited a number of allegations by the late Virginia Giuffre, including that she was \"lent out\" to Andrew by Epstein on a number of occasions.",
      "\"In response to a subpoena issued to the Epstein estate, the Committee has identified financial records containing notations such as \"massage for Andrew\" that raise serious questions regarding the nature of your relationship with Mr. Epstein and related financial transactions,\" the letter said.",
      "The House Democrats also mentioned Giuffre's memoir, which was published posthumously this year, in which she mentioned her fear of Andrew retaliating if she publicized allegations against him.",
      "\"This fear of retaliation has been a persistent obstacle to many of those who were victimized in their fight for justice. In addition to Mr. Epstein's crimes, we are investigating any such efforts to silence, intimidate, or threaten victims, and are interested in any avenues that may further shed light on these activities,\" the letter said.",
      "Andrew was asked to respond to the letter by Nov. 20th, \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter.\"",
      "He was stripped of both his \"Royal Highness\" and \"prince\" titles on Thursday, and last month he gave up other royal titles, including \"Duke of York.\"",
      "He had already stepped down from public duties as a member of the royal family in 2019, after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "After allowing his younger brother to slowly and voluntarily give up his royal honors for months, King Charles III announced abruptly on October 30 \u2014 after more revelations about Andrew's past ties to Epstein \u2014 that he would be deprived of the titles and evicted from his long-time, 30-bedroom mansion on the Windsor estate.",
      "Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the request from U.S. lawmakers for the former prince to give on-the-record remarks, and there was no immediate reply from Andrew to a CBS News request for comment on the matter.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 05:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "Amid public forums and local cries for help, states are also talking with large health systems, technology companies, and others amid intensifying competition for shares of a $50 billion fund to improve rural health.",
    "story": [
      "Echo Kopplin wants South Dakota's leaders to know that money from a new $50 billion federal rural health fund should help residents with limited transportation options.",
      "Kopplin, a physician assistant who works with seniors, low-income people, and mental health patients in the rural Black Hills, shared her thoughts at a meeting hosted by state officials.",
      "South Dakota's leaders did a \"good job of diving in\" and asking questions to get \"deeper at the root of the problem,\" she said.",
      "Kopplin later told KFF Health News how one of her rural patients recently missed two appointments because of a broken-down car and no access to public transportation.",
      "Nationwide, health care workers like Kopplin and thousands of others \u2014 from patient advocates to technology executives \u2014 flocked to town halls or online portals during the seven weeks state leaders had to craft and submit their applications for the Rural Health Transformation Program to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. That deadline was Nov. 5.",
      "\"We will give $50 billion away by the end of the year,\" CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz said Nov. 6 at a Milken Institute event in Washington. He said all 50 states had submitted applications.",
      "The program will \"allow us to right-size the health care system,\" Oz said, adding that innovations from the rural work \"will spill over to suburban and urban America as well.\"",
      "Among applications and summaries publicly shared by states, themes include workforce development, telehealth, and access to healthy food. In Kansas, leaders want to build a \"Food is Medicine\" program. Wyoming officials propose a new program called \"BearCare,\" a state-sponsored health insurance plan that patients could use only after medical emergencies.",
      "But many health policy experts and Democrats are raising alarms that the Republican-backed program will become a \"slush fund.\" Critics worry it will fail to reach the small-town patients they say need it most, especially as states face nearly a trillion dollars in Medicaid spending reductions over the next decade. Medicaid, a joint federal-state program, serves nearly 1 in 4 rural Americans.",
      "\"The status quo is tremendous distress in rural communities,\" said Heather Howard, a professor of the practice at Princeton University and director of the university's State Health and Value Strategies program, which is tracking the rural health fund. The new funding won't be enough to offset the Medicaid losses, she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans added the five-year, $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to President Donald Trump's massive tax-and-spending legislation. The move helped win support for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act from conservative holdouts who worried that the Medicaid cuts in the bill would harm rural hospitals in their states.",
      "In Montana, which hosted an online public forum before submitting its application, a nonprofit director pitched youth peer support as a way of battling high suicide rates. A registered nurse asked state leaders to \"think maybe even bigger\" and consider statewide universal health care.",
      "And in Georgia, a technology-focused chain of primary care clinics that serves seniors proposed expanding its operations into that state in its online public comment. A rural grant writer asked for \"safe and stable housing.\"",
      "The law says half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application. The rest will be doled out according to a points-based system. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that, in part, mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "Top Senate Democrats have raised alarms about the rural health program. They include Ron Wyden of Oregon and Tina Smith of Minnesota, who called on a federal watchdog agency to investigate the fairness and implementation of the fund. Taylor Harvey, a Wyden aide, said the Government Accountability Office has confirmed it will investigate.",
      "According to the federal statute, no less than a quarter of states with an approved application may share the second half of the funding each fiscal year, CMS spokesperson Catherine Howden said. The agency plans to publish summaries of approved state projects, according to CMS guidance.",
      "A handful of conservative-leaning states \u2014 including Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma \u2014 have already instituted regulatory and legislative initiatives, such as prohibiting \"non-nutritious\" foods in benefit programs, that garner additional points in the program application process.",
      "Michael Chameides, a county supervisor in rural New York, said he fears the money could \"be used in ways that would hurt certain states or reward certain states.\" Chameides is also the communications and policy director with the Rural Democracy Initiative, a national advocacy organization that released a rural action report last month.",
      "Edwin Park, a research professor at Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families, said federal lawmakers gave Oz and his agency \"really excessive discretion\" when awarding the money.",
      "Federal administrators have added rules that aren't within the statute that created the program, Park said. For example, its application guidelines say states cannot use more than 15% of their funding to pay providers for patient care \u2014 payments that are expected to take a hit due to the Medicaid cuts.",
      "Georgetown's health policy experts and Democrats aren't the only ones with concerns. Some Republicans and small hospitals in Ohio worry the money will go to large health systems instead of smaller, independent hospitals that serve people within their rural communities.",
      "CMS' Oz repeated the idea of getting \"big hospitals to adopt smaller institutions\" at the Washington gathering after applications were filed. He used similar language at a rural health summit hosted by South Dakota-based Sanford Health. \"How do we get big hospitals to adopt smaller hospitals? Not to take them over, but to keep them viable by giving them good telehealth services, specialty support, radiology support,\" he said at the October event.",
      "Sanford owns or manages dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics and long-term care centers, as well as a health insurance company. The system reported about $81 million in operating income during the first six months of fiscal year 2025, according to a recent bond rating report.",
      "Last year, Sanford opened a \"command center\" for its systemwide telehealth initiative. It launched a telehealth expansion in 2021 and offers virtual care for 78 medical specialties, Sanford President and CEO Bill Gassen said.",
      "\"We've tried to imagine, what if that number doubles?\" Gassen said. The startup costs for telehealth are high, he said, and the rural fund could be a unique opportunity \"for us to make virtual care available to more patients, to more communities, to more hospitals and health systems across the country.\"",
      "Gassen, who is set to chair the American Hospital Association in 2027, said Sanford leaders have met with state and federal officials, including Oz, whom he's known for years, and Chris Klomp, a top deputy at CMS and a senior adviser to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The word \"telehealth\" appears 36 times in the rural health program's 124-page application guidelines. But Don Robbins Jr., chief executive of a small hospital on the Illinois-Kentucky border, chuckled at the idea of using the funding for that purpose.",
      "Robbins, whose 25-bed Massac Memorial Hospital averages five to seven patients in its beds each day, said his hospital does not regularly offer telehealth. Even if it did, he said, patients living more than a mile outside of town couldn't use it because they don't have a good internet connection.",
      "The small hospital reported a $31,314 loss in September, Robbins said. \"I think if we get anything out of it,\" Robbins said of the rural health program, \"we'll be lucky.\"",
      "Kopplin, the physician assistant who attended the South Dakota meeting, is cautiously optimistic about the rural health fund. She views it as a wonderful chance for states to test out ideas and learn from what works and what doesn't.",
      "But \"in a lot of ways this bill is going to be a band-aid approach\" for rural health, she said. \"It's not really going to fix the problem.\"",

    "story": [
      "Foreigners seeking visas to live in the U.S. might be rejected if they have certain medical conditions, including diabetes or obesity, under a Thursday directive from the Trump administration.",
      "The guidance, issued in a cable the State Department sent to embassy and consular officials and examined by KFF Health News, directs visa officers to deem applicants ineligible to enter the U.S. for several new reasons, including age or the likelihood they might rely on public benefits. The guidance says that such people could become a \"public charge\" \u2014 a potential drain on U.S. resources \u2014 because of their health issues or age.",
      "While assessing the health of potential immigrants has been part of the visa application process for years, including screening for communicable diseases like tuberculosis and obtaining vaccine history, experts said the new guidelines greatly expand the list of medical conditions to be considered and give visa officers more power to make decisions about immigration based on an applicant's health status.",
      "The directive is part of the Trump administration's divisive and aggressive campaign to deport immigrants living without authorization in the U.S. and dissuade others from immigrating into the country. The White House's crusade to push out immigrants has included daily mass arrests, bans on refugees from certain countries, and plans to severely restrict the total number permitted into the U.S.",
      "The new guidelines mandate that immigrants' health be a focus in the application process. The guidance applies to nearly all visa applicants but is likely to be used only in cases in which people seek to permanently reside in the U.S., said Charles Wheeler, a senior attorney for the Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a nonprofit legal aid group.",
      "\"You must consider an applicant's health,\" the cable reads. \"Certain medical conditions \u2014 including, but not limited to, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, cancers, diabetes, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, and mental health conditions \u2014 can require hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of care.\"",
      "About 10% of the world's population has diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases are also common; they are the globe's leading killer.",
      "The cable also encourages visa officers to consider other conditions, like obesity, which it notes can cause asthma, sleep apnea, and high blood pressure, in their assessment of whether an immigrant could become a public charge and therefore should be denied entry into the U.S.",
      "\"All of these can require expensive, long-term care,\" the cable reads. Spokespeople for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cable.",
      "Visa officers were also directed to determine if applicants have the means to pay for medical treatment without help from the U.S. government.",
      "\"Does the applicant have adequate financial resources to cover the costs of such care over his entire expected lifespan without seeking public cash assistance or long-term institutionalization at government expense?\" the cable reads.",
      "The cable's language appears at odds with the Foreign Affairs Manual, the State Department's own handbook, which says that visa officers cannot reject an application based on \"what if\" scenarios, Wheeler said.",
      "The guidance directs visa officers to develop \"their own thoughts about what could lead to some sort of medical emergency or sort of medical costs in the future,\" he said. \"That's troubling because they're not medically trained, they have no experience in this area, and they shouldn't be making projections based on their own personal knowledge or bias.\"",
      "The guidance also directs visa officers to consider the health of family members, including children or older parents.",
      "\"Do any of the dependents have disabilities, chronic medical conditions, or other special needs and require care such that the applicant cannot maintain employment?\" the cable asks.",
      "Immigrants already undergo a medical exam by a physician who's been approved by a U.S. embassy.",
      "They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to fill out a form that asks them to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions, or violence. They're also required to have a number of vaccinations to guard against infectious diseases like measles, polio, and hepatitis B.",
      "But the new guidance goes further, emphasizing that chronic diseases should be considered, said Sophia Genovese, an immigration lawyer at Georgetown University. She also noted that the language of the directive encourages visa officers and the doctors who examine people seeking to immigrate to speculate on the cost of applicants' medical care and their ability to get employment in the U.S., considering their medical history.",

    "summary": "The deal, with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, is expected to lower the price of obesity drugs to between $149 and $350 per month in some cases, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday announced a deal to drastically lower the price of weight loss drugs for some Americans.",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that the two world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, have agreed to offer their most popular GLP-1 weight loss drug \u2014 I call it the fat drug, remember \u2014 at drastic discounts,\" the president announced in the Oval Office.",
      "Under the deal, Eli Lilly, the maker of Zepbound, and Novo Nordisk, the company behind Ozempic and Wegovy, have agreed to lower the price of their weight loss drugs for eligible patients on Medicare, Medicaid and for eligible users of the\u00a0planned \"TrumpRx\" pharmaceutical website.",
      "The price per month for most eligible people will be $245 to $350 a month on average, administration officials said. The cost for the drug now is as high as $1,350 per month.",
      "\"You think it was easy dealing with these people? It wasn't,\" Mr. Trump said, referring to pharmaceutical company executives. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said this agreement took \"months and months\" of negotiations.",
      "Mr. Trump said Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk have also agreed to provide all their other medications at \"most-favored-nation\" prices, meaning Americans will pay a competitively low price like the consumers in other countries do.",
      "The Oval Office event was cut short when one of the company attendees fainted, and members of the press were ushered out of the room. \"The White House Medical Unit quickly jumped into action, and the gentleman is okay,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.",
      "A representative from Eli Lilly said the person was a guest of the company and had a \"brief medical situation,\" but was \"receiving the best medical care.\"",
      "Details of the weight loss drug price deal",
      "TrumpRx, which is expected to launch as early as the end of this year, will allow customers to buy prescription drugs directly from pharmaceutical companies without going through insurance.",
      "When purchased through TrumpRx, the cost will be around $350 per month for injections of Ozempic and Wegovy, officials told reporters on a briefing call. The new pricing will go into effect in January.",
      "If the Food and Drug Administration later approves similar GLP-1 drugs intended to be taken orally, the initial dose of those pills will be $149 per month through TrumpRx, the officials said.",
      "For eligible patients on Medicaid and Medicare, officials said the cost will be $245 for Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound. The Medicare copay is $50.",
      "Administration officials hope the new pricing kicks in for Medicare in mid-2026, likely by July. For Medicaid, the timing will be based on states' willingness to participate.",
      "Not everyone will be eligible for the lowest prices. According to senior administration officials who briefed reporters on a call ahead of the president's announcement, the lower costs will be available for the following Medicare patients:",
      "Patients with a BMI over 27 who have also been diagnosed as pre-diabetic, or who have had a stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease;\u00a0Patients with a BMI over 30 who also have stage-three kidney disease or other qualifying comorbidities;Patients with a BMI over 35, which represents severe obesity.",
      "Patients with a BMI over 27 who have also been diagnosed as pre-diabetic, or who have had a stroke, myocardial infarction or peripheral artery disease;",
      "Patients with a BMI over 30 who also have stage-three kidney disease or other qualifying comorbidities;",
      "Patients with a BMI over 35, which represents severe obesity.",
      "Senior administration officials said they believe about 10% of Medicare patients will be eligible for the lower prices. The new pricing could save about $170 billion over time from the reduced risks of obesity in the Medicare population, one official said.",
      "About 40% of Americans are obese, according to CDC data, though a recent survey suggests the rate has started to decline. Research shows obesity is one of the leading causes of preventable deaths in the United States.",
      "\"This is not about losing weight \u2014 this is about making America healthy again,\" said another official on the call. \"This is about preventing strokes, this is about preventing end-stage renal disease. So, given that, we are constraining the access for patients that will benefit clinically from it.\"",
      "Other prescription drug websites, such as GoodRx, won't be partnering with TrumpRx, administration officials told CBS News. Pharmaceutical companies will decide how to fulfill consumers' orders \u2014 via their own in-house logistics or by partnering with a third-party platform, one official said.",
      "The administration announced plans for the TrumpRx initiative earlier this fall, and has struck deals with several other major pharmaceutical companies. But some analysts say the \"most-favored-nation\" pricing being promised could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously floated the possibility of lower prices for weight loss drugs and expressed dismay about the high costs.",
      "\"I call it the fat pill or the fat drug,\" he said at an event on drug prices in September. \"Sometimes it works, I guess, for people. The ones I've seen, it hasn't worked so well. I've got a lot of friends, they're fat. They said, 'Yeah, I lost some weight.' I said, 'Yeah, don't look it to me.'\"",
      "Kennedy said the administration is also working to get healthier foods into schools and the military, and to increase physical activity in schools. The administration expects to release new dietary guidelines soon, Kennedy said.",
      "\"In the meantime, there is nothing more important that we can do than lower this price,\" Kennedy said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing a new passport policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Trump administration to enforce for now its policy ending the use of the \"X\" marker on passports and requiring the documents to reflect the passport-holder's \"biological sex at birth.\"",
      "The high court agreed to freeze a lower court order that stopped the State Department from enforcing the policy put into place by President Trump earlier this year. The injunction allowed transgender or nonbinary people seeking passports to self-select the sex designation \u2014 \"M,\" \"F\" or \"X\" \u2014 that aligns with their gender identity.",
      "The Supreme Court appeared to split 6-3 in the decision, with the three liberal justices in dissent.",
      "\"Displaying passport holders' sex at birth no more offends equal protection principles than displaying their country of birth \u2014 in both cases, the Government is merely attesting to a historical fact without subjecting anyone to differential treatment,\" the court said in an unsigned decision. \"And on this record, respondents have failed to establish that the Government's choice to display biological sex 'lack[s] any purpose other than a bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group.'\"",
      "The court said in its order that the Trump administration is likely to succeed on the merits of the case, and wrote that the district court's decision to provide broad relief blocks enforcement of an executive branch policy \"with foreign affairs implications concerning a Government document.\"",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote that the harms to the plaintiffs challenging the new rules outweigh the government's interest in immediately implementing the passport policy.",
      "Without relief, transgender Americans \"are forced to make a difficult choice that no other Americans face: use gender-incongruent passports and risk harassment and bodily invasions, on the one hand, or avoid all activities (travel, opening a bank account, renting a car, starting a new job) that may require a passport, on the other,\" Jackson wrote. \"The harm to these individuals from having to make that choice \u2014 before their legal challenges have even been resolved \u2014 is palpable.\"",
      "She was joined in her dissent by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.",
      "The Trump administration had argued that the district court in Massachusetts interfered with the president's exercise of his foreign policy powers with its June ruling. It also said it has been the government's policy since 1977 \u2014 with the exception of during the Biden administration \u2014 to not allow passport applicants to self-select their preferred sex designation.",
      "\"Private citizens cannot force the government to use inaccurate sex designations on identification documents that fail to reflect the person's biological sex \u2014 especially not on identification documents that are government property and an exercise of the President's constitutional and statutory power to communicate with foreign governments,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "Mr. Trump's directive reversed a policy adopted by the Biden administration that let passport applicants choose their sex marker on the document based on their gender identity and added the \"X\" marker as an option for those who are nonbinary or don't identify as strictly male or female.",
      "The president's measure defined \"sex\" as an \"individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female.\" It directed the State Department to require that government-issued documents like passports \"accurately reflect the holder's sex,\" effectively stopping applicants from choosing a sex marker based on their gender identity.",
      "On the heels of Mr. Trump's directive, the State Department stopped issuing passports with the \"X\" marker and changed applications to offer only the \"M\" or \"F\" designations. It also adopted procedures for using an applicant's sex that matches their birth certificate or other documents.",
      "Seven transgender and nonbinary people sued the administration in February over the new passport policy, alleging that the change was unconstitutional and violated federal law. They sought a court order that required the State Department to reinstate the Biden administration's policy and allow them to self-attest as to their sex, including by selecting the \"X\" marker.",
      "U.S. District Judge Julia Kobick issued a temporary order in April siding with the plaintiffs, finding in part that the State Department \"failed to offer a reasoned explanation\" for the new passport policy. Kobick, appointed by President Joe Biden, also ruled that Mr. Trump's executive order and passport policy were motivated by animus toward transgender people and discriminates based on sex.",
      "\"Viewed as a whole, the language of the Executive Order is candid in its rejection of the identity of an entire group \u2014 transgender Americans \u2014 who have always existed and have long been recognized in, among other fields, law and the medical profession,\" Kobick wrote in her decision.",
      "In June, she extended her preliminary injunction to cover members of a certified class who would seek a new passport that reflected a sex designation aligning with their gender identity or wanted a passport with the \"X\" designation.",
      "Kobick required the Trump administration to allow those passport applicants to self-select a sex marker \u2014 including the \"X\" designation \u2014 that corresponds with their gender identity.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decision and sought emergency relief allowing it to enforce its new policy. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit rejected the administration's request.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, Sauer argued the passport policy is \"eminently lawful.\" He wrote that the injunction issued by the Boston judge blocking the plan's enforcement compels the Trump administration to \"speak to foreign governments in contravention of both the President's foreign policy and scientific reality.\"",
      "\"The question is whether the Constitution requires the government to adopt respondents' preferred definition of sex. It does not,\" Sauer wrote, adding that the passport policy defines sex in terms of biology, not self-identification.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs, however, said the State Department has for decades allowed changes to passport sex markers to align with the applicant's gender identity.",
      "\"By classifying people based on sex assigned at birth and exclusively issuing sex markers on passports based on that sex classification, the State Department deprives Plaintiffs of a usable identification document and the ability to travel safely,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing.",

    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 08:33:14 -0500",
    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump is nominating Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator after all.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump has decided once again to nominate Jared Isaacman to serve as his NASA administrator, he announced Tuesday evening, months after withdrawing the tech billionaire and private astronaut's nomination because of concerns about his political leanings.",
      "Mr. Trump nominated Isaacman to the Senate-confirmed post last year, but announced in late May he had decided to withdraw Isaacman after a \"thorough review\" of his \"prior associations.\"",
      "Weeks after the withdrawal, the president went further in expressing his concerns about Isaacman's credentials. At the time, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he thought Isaacman \"was very good,\" but had been \"surprised to learn\" that Isaacman was a \"blue-blooded Democrat, who had never contributed to a Republican before.\"",
      "Federal Election Commission records\u00a0show\u00a0Isaacman has donated to Democratic congressional candidates and Democratic aligned groups, though he has also given some money to Republicans. Isaacman has\u00a0described himself\u00a0as \"relatively apolitical\" and a \"right-leaning moderate,\" and said he disclosed his political donations to Democrats prior to his nomination.",
      "Isaacman has had the endorsement of a powerful fellow tech entrepreneur, Mr. Trump's former adviser, Elon Musk. Isaacman, the CEO and founder of credit card-processing company Shift4, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with Musk's company SpaceX. He bought a series of spaceflights from SpaceX, which has extensive contracts with NASA to transport astronauts and equipment.",
      "The president and Musk had a very public falling-out earlier this year, but are now on better terms. Last week, Mr. Trump told reporters he and Musk have spoken \"on and off\" since sitting together at conservative activist Charlie Kirk's funeral last month in Arizona and that their relationship is \"good.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Mr. Trump suggested that he withdrew Isaacman's nomination in part because of his relationship with Musk, saying he \"thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon's corporate life.\"",
      "Isaacman said on X he \"only know[s] Elon professionally\" and does not own any equity in SpaceX, but he has a \"firsthand appreciation for what he and his companies have accomplished.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made no mention of his previous decision to nominate and then withdraw Isaacman in his Tuesday evening announcement of the re-nomination on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\"This evening, I am pleased to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of NASA,\" Trump posted. \"Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman thanked the president and the \"space-loving community\" Tuesday in a post on X, writing: \"I am not sure how I earned the trust of so many, but I will do everything I can to live up to those expectations.\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been serving as interim NASA administrator. The president on Tuesday praised Duffy for doing an \"incredible job.\"",
      "The Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee approved Isaacman's nomination in late April and a vote by the full Senate had been expected when Mr. Trump announced he was yanking the nomination.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have spotted the brightest flare yet from a supermassive black hole that shines with the light of 10 trillion suns.",
      "These bursts of light and energy can come from things like tangled-up magnetic fields or hiccups in the heated gas disks surrounding black holes. The flares help illuminate researchers' understanding of the black holes within.",
      "The flare came from a supermassive black hole that's 10 billion light years away, making the flash the most distant one observed so far. It hails from a time when the universe was rather young. A light year is nearly 6 trillion miles.",
      "The latest cosmic display was spotted in 2018 by a camera at the Palomar Observatory in California. It took about three months to shine at peak brightness and has been decaying in the years since.",
      "It likely happened because a large star wandered too close to the black hole and got shredded to pieces.",
      "\"At first, we didn't really believe the numbers about the energy,\" said study author Matthew Graham with the California Institute of Technology, which operates Palomar.",
      "The new findings were published Tuesday in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "Almost every large galaxy, including our Milky Way, has a supermassive black hole at its center. The immense pull of that black hole, which is surrounded by powerful magnetic fields, gives the Milky Way its characteristic swirl.",
      "Scientists still aren't sure how supermassive black holes form.",
      "Studying such behemoths can help researchers better understand the stellar neighborhood surrounding supermassive black holes. The discovery also allows scientists \"to probe the interaction of supermassive black holes with their environments early in the universe,\" said Joseph Michail with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which didn't have a role in the new study. Those early interactions created the cosmos humans now call home.",
      "The oldest black hole yet discovered was spotted by scientists in March 2024. That supermassive black hole was formed when our 13.8 billion-year-old universe was just 430 million years old. The black hole is at the center of a distant galaxy and is vigorously growing, researchers said.",
      "Another ancient supermassive black hole was discovered\u00a0by NASA researchers in 2023. That one was formed about 13.2 billion years ago, making it about 40 million years older than the one found in 2024. It is about 10 times bigger than the Milky Way's black hole.",

      "Apple called out European officials in a heated letter shared with CBS News, arguing European Union regulations that forced the tech giant to allow smaller rivals into its App Store have made its platform less safe for consumers.",
      "Because of the changes, \"risks to users on our devices will inevitably increase,\" Apple Vice President Kyle Andeer says in a letter Thursday to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.",
      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",

      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",

      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's lawyers argued an interview conducted by a U.S. asylum officer last month did not amount to sufficient due process.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration late Friday urged a federal judge in Maryland to allow immigration officials to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0to the West African country of Liberia, saying the U.S. government has cleared the final legal hurdle in the deportation process.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has been at the center of the national debate over President Trump's immigration crackdown ever since he was deported to El Salvador in March, in violation of a federal immigration judge's order that barred his deportation to his native country. After being held in detention facilities in El Salvador for months, including a notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June, only to face federal criminal charges of human smuggling. He has denied those charges.",
      "While a trial on those criminal charges has yet to commence, the Trump administration has mounted an aggressive effort to deport Abrego Garcia from the U.S. a second time, proposing to send him to several far-flung African countries, including Uganda, Eswatini and most recently, Liberia.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion on Friday asking U.S. District Court Judge Paula Xinis to scrap a ruling she issued this summer barring the government from deporting Abrego Garcia, arguing all legal avenues to contest his deportation have been exhausted.",
      "On Oct. 28, the Justice Department said, a U.S. government asylum officer interviewed Abrego Garcia, who remains in federal immigration detention, and determined he had failed to prove he would face persecution or torture in Liberia.",
      "Any additional due process steps for Abrego Garcia are unwarranted, the Justice Department argued.",
      "\"Petitioner's claims are procedurally barred multiple times over and fail on the merits in any event,\" the Justice Department said in its filing. \"This Court should therefore dissolve its preliminary injunction and permit the government to remove Petitioner to Liberia.\"",
      "The Trump administration submitted declarations from top U.S. officials asserting that Liberia has made \"sufficient and credible\" assurances that Abrego Garcia will not be harmed there or sent to another nation where he would be persecuted. In a press release late last month, Liberia's government said it had agreed to receive Abrego Garcia on \"a strictly humanitarian and temporary basis,\" following a U.S. request.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys, however, argued in their own court filing on Friday that the interview conducted by a U.S. asylum officer last month did not amount to sufficient due process.",
      "\"The Government insists that the unreasoned determination of a single immigration officer\u2014who concluded that Abrego Garcia failed to establish that it is 'more likely than not' that he will be persecuted or tortured in Liberia\u2014 satisfies due process. It does not,\" they wrote.",
      "His lawyers also argued the Trump administration's ongoing effort to send Abrego Garcia to Africa \u2014 instead of Costa Rica, which has agreed to offer him refugee status \u2014 is a form of retaliation. They noted the government offered to send Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica this summer but only if he pleaded guilty to the federal human smuggling charges he faces in Tennessee.",
      "\"The timeline suggests a pattern: when the Government received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's civil case challenging his unlawful removal to El Salvador; it initiated a criminal prosecution in retaliation; and when it received orders it disliked in Abrego Garcia's criminal case, it initiated third-country removal efforts in retaliation,\" the attorneys said.",
      "The lawyers asked Xinis, the federal judge in Maryland, to prohibit the Trump administration from deporting Abrego Garcia to Liberia \"unless and until an immigration judge concurs\" with the determination made by the asylum officer who interviewed him. They said that review should consider the possibility that their client could be returned to El Salvador after being sent to Liberia.",
      "Abrego Garcia first came to the U.S. in 2011, when he was 16. According to court documents, he entered the country illegally. In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after an encounter with local police outside of a Maryland Home Depot. Abrego Garcia's attorneys said he went there looking for work.",
      "Court documents show an immigration judge initially denied Abrego Garcia's release on bond, partially due to information submitted by the government that it said tied him to the MS-13 gang. The judge's bond denial, upheld by an immigration appeals board, mentioned information from an informant whom the government deemed to be credible. Abrego Garcia has denied being part of a gang.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ultimately released from ICE custody later in 2019 after another immigration judge granted him \"withholding of removal,\" barring his deportation to El Salvador due to concerns he could be targeted by gangs there. However, he was also issued a deportation order based on his illegal entry into the U.S.",
      "Earlier this year, Abrego Garcia was again arrested by ICE, before being deported to El Salvador in March, as part of a high-profile deportation effort that sent several hundred Venezuelan and Salvadoran men accused of having gang ties to the CECOT prison. The Trump administration conceded in federal court that the deportation had been a mistake due to the 2019 withholding of removal order but Abrego Garcia nevertheless remained detained in El Salvador for months.",
      "After being returned to the U.S. in June, Abrego Garcia was held in federal criminal custody, pending the start of his trial. After a federal judge in Tennessee ordered his release from pre-trial detention later in the summer, he was able to see his U.S. citizen child and wife in Maryland over a weekend. But his freedom was short-lived. In late August, Abrego Garcia was instructed to check in to the ICE field office in Baltimore, where he was again taken into custody.",

    "summary": "In late September, President Trump announced he would be deploying federal troops to Portland in response to downtown protests over the administration's immigration crackdown.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Friday issued a ruling \"permanently\" blocking the Trump administration from deploying National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon.",
      "In late September, President Trump\u00a0announced\u00a0he would be deploying federal troops to Portland in response to downtown protests outside a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility over the administration's immigration crackdown. The Trump administration later placed 200 Oregon National Guard troops under federal control, and attempted to deploy another 200 federalized California National Guard troops in Portland\u00a0as well.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked Title 10 of the federal code in his deployment efforts, which allows for its use if the president deems that \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\"",
      "The moves\u00a0prompted a lawsuit\u00a0from city and state officials in Portland, Oregon and California.",
      "In her 106-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut wrote that \"this Court arrives at the necessary conclusion that there was neither 'a rebellion or danger of a rebellion' nor was the President 'unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States' in Oregon when he ordered the federalization and deployment of the National Guard.\"",
      "The ruling, however, will allow the National Guard troops to remain under federal control for a period of at least 14 days.",
      "\"President Trump is using his lawful authority to direct the National Guard to protect federal assets and personnel in Portland following months of violent riots where officers have been assaulted and doxxed by left-wing rioters,\" Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Friday night in response to the ruling. \"The President's lawful actions will make Portland safer.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said Friday night in a statement: \"The facts haven't changed. Amidst ongoing violent riots and lawlessness, that local leaders have refused to step in to quell, President Trump has exercised his lawful authority to protect federal officers and assets. President Trump will not turn a blind eye to the lawlessness plaguing American cities and we expect to be vindicated by a higher court.\"",
      "In her own statement, Democratic Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek said, \"This ruling, now the fourth of its kind, validates the facts on the ground. Oregon does not want or need military intervention, and President Trump's attempts to federalize the guard is a gross abuse of power. Oregon National Guard members have been away from their jobs and families for 38 days. The California National Guard has been here for just over one month. Based on this ruling, I am renewing my call to the Trump Administration to send all troops home now.\"",
      "Under Title 10, the \"president may call into federal service members and units of the National Guard of any State in such numbers as he considers necessary to repel the invasion, suppress the rebellion, or execute those laws,\" in the event that \"the United States, or any of the commonwealths or possessions, is invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation; there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States; or the president is unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States.\"",
      "The latest decision comes after Immergut, an appointee of Mr. Trump, issued a 16-page ruling Sunday temporarily barring the Trump administration from deploying the National Guard in Portland following a three-day trial in which she \"found no credible evidence\" that protests in the city grew out of control.",
      "Immergut had said she would issue a final order on Friday due to the voluminous evidence presented at trial, including more than 750 exhibits.",
      "\"After a three-day trial that included the testimony of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials and hundreds of exhibits describing protest activity outside the Portland ICE building, the evidence demonstrates that these deployments, which were objected to by Oregon's governor and not requested by the federal officials in charge of protection of the ICE building, exceeded the President's authority,\" Immergut wrote Friday.",
      "The Trump administration on Monday appealed the ruling to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Immergut issued two orders in early October that blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. She previously found that Mr. Trump had failed to show that he met the legal requirements for mobilizing the National Guard. She described his assessment of Portland, which Mr. Trump has called \"war-ravaged\" with \"fires all over the place,\" as \"simply untethered to the facts.\"",
      "One of Immergut's orders was paused Oct. 20 by the 9th Circuit court. But late Tuesday, the appeals court vacated that decision and said it would rehear the matter before an 11-judge panel. Until the larger panel rehears the case, the appeals court's initial order from early October \u2014 under which the National Guard is federalized but not deployed \u2014 remains in effect.",
      "During the Portland trial, witnesses including local police and federal officials were questioned about the law enforcement response to the nightly protests at the city's ICE building. The demonstrations peaked in June, when Portland police declared one a riot. The demonstrations typically drew a couple dozen people in the weeks leading up to Mr. Trump's National Guard announcement.",

    "summary": "A new documentary, \"Second Wind,\" highlights Ukraine's wounded veterans, following four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro.",
    "story": [
      "As Ukraine's war with Russia grinds into its fourth year, the country is contending with a staggering toll of wounded soldiers and civilians \u2014 and an emerging generation of amputees reshaping what survival looks like in a nation under siege.",
      "A new documentary highlighting the country's wounded veterans screened this week at the French ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C. The film, \"Second Wind,\" follows four amputee soldiers and a female sniper, all severely wounded in combat, as they climb Mount Kilimanjaro \u2014 an account of grit and perseverance that comes amid one of the largest waves of war-related amputations in modern European history, and that mirrors the country's struggle to rise out of conflict.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said that around 380,000 Ukrainian troops have been wounded since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. International medical organizations estimate that between 20,000 and 50,000 Ukrainians \u2014 including soldiers and civilians \u2014 have undergone amputations, with the World Health Organization saying the total number could approach 100,000.",
      "The scale and severity of those injuries have put enormous strain on Ukraine's medical and rehabilitation systems, with hospitals and prosthetic centers operating well beyond capacity.",
      "Filmed by Kyiv-born director Masha Kondakova, \"Second Wind\" documents the physical and psychological rehabilitation of soldiers injured by mines, artillery fire and drone strikes before they undertook their climb up Africa's highest peak. Kondakova, who began filming on the front lines of the conflict in 2014, said she wanted to focus not on the war itself but on what follows survival.",
      "\"We didn't want to make a movie about the war,\" Kondakova said in an interview with CBS News at the embassy of Ukraine in Washington. \"That was not the purpose at all. It's about our simple people, simple guys and one girl who became heroes because they're constantly overcoming their personal limits.\"",
      "\"Just take one step, and you will find your second wind. Maybe not with the first step \u2014 but with the second, you will,\" she said.",
      "Kondakova, who previously directed award-winning films about Ukraine's female soldiers and de-occupied zones near Kyiv, said \"Second Wind\" completes a trilogy about resilience. \"My first movie was about women at war at a moment when women didn't have positions in the army as fighters, and then a short, fictional movie about youth stolen by the war,\" she said. \"This third one \u2014 from the trenches in the east of Ukraine to the summit of Kilimanjaro \u2014 is about the resilience of our defenders. About how our scars become our strength.\"",
      "Among them is Mykhailo Matviiv, a soldier who lost a leg to a Russian airstrike and has since returned to the front lines to work as a drone operator on the eastern front. In an interview alongside Kondakova, he said returning to the front was not a question of choice.",
      "\"I can't live a normal life while my brothers are still at the front,\" he said, through translation. \"The injury created some doubts because I don't want to hold anybody back. But this experience showed me I can still be helpful and useful, as if the injury were not there.\"",
      "Matviiv, who applied his own tourniquet when he was wounded, said he had witnessed enemy forces intentionally target one soldier in order to attract medics or evacuation teams, only to then strike a bigger group.",
      "He added that the film's purpose was not to seek pity but to motivate. \"It's to show that life doesn't end with an injury,\" he said. \"You just climb your own personal summit, step by step.\"",
      "The documentary has already been shown in Ukrainian military hospitals, where Kondakova recalls one of the most emotional moments of her career.",
      "\"We were downstairs in a top secret [bunker] because otherwise we could be a target,\" she said. \"I was sitting behind one of our defenders, very young, who had just had this experience of amputation but no prosthesis yet.\"",
      "\"People were crying or so emotional,\" she said, \"I had a feeling they were with [the film's subjects] for each joke, they laughed as if they were together.\"",
      "Ukraine's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Olha Stefanishyna, said at the screening in Washington that the film was an important reminder for Americans in particular of the value of continued U.S. support for Ukrainian soldiers.",
      "\"It is very important to me that Americans can see what the true spirit of freedom is, and why their support matters,\" Stefanishyna said. \"This film shows that our Ukrainians \u2014 despite losing their legs \u2014 continued to fight, and they carried that spirit to the top of Kilimanjaro.\"",
      "The film arrives as Ukraine faces a long-term rehabilitation crisis. The Ministry of Health has said demand for prosthetics, particularly bionic limbs, has gone up sharply since the start of the war. Medical facilities such as Superhumans Center in Lviv \u2014 one of the country's most advanced prosthetics facilities \u2014 are operating at full capacity, while thousands of soldiers remain on waiting lists.",
      "Kondakova and her team have since launched The Second Wind Project, an organization designed to connect amputees through sports and peer support. \"We want every wounded soldier to feel the shoulder of a brother-in-arms,\" she said.",
      "She said she hopes \"Second Wind\" can also help raise awareness among policymakers and potential donors. \"The process of prosthetics and rehabilitation is long and expensive,\" she said. \"We need not only money, but expertise \u2014 veterans, doctors, specialists who can share experience.\"",
      "For Matviiv, who said after the film's U.S. screenings he will return again to the front near Pokrovsk, where some of the most intense fighting of the war continues, the message is straightforward. \"We are still fighting,\" he said. \"Any limitations that we have, we keep going and we keep defending.\"",
      "\"Second Wind\" continues an international tour this month, with screenings scheduled in New York, London, and Paris.",

      "However, that hope faded a few months ago when her team lost almost all its government funding.",

    "summary": "The leader of the influential conservative think tank is facing calls to resign and several staff members have left in protest.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative think tank, is in turmoil after its leader defended former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who interviewed white nationalist and Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes on his popular online show.",
      "The controversy has led to several resignations as the think tank \u2014 which spearheaded Project 2025, a conservative policy blueprint meant to guide President Trump's second administration \u2014 addresses the fallout.",
      "What Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts said in defense of Tucker Carlson",
      "As Carlson was criticized by conservatives for giving Fuentes a platform, Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts stepped in to defend Carlson, pushing back on speculation that the think tank was distancing itself from its \"close friend\" and decrying the \"venomous coalition\" attacking the former cable news host.",
      "\"The Heritage Foundation didn't become the intellectual backbone of the conservative movement by canceling our own people or policing the consciences of Christians, and we won't start doing that now,\" Roberts said in a video shared on Oct. 30.",
      "\"Their attempt to cancel [Carlson] will fail,\" he continued. \"I disagree with and even abhor things that Nick Fuentes says, but canceling him is not the answer either.\"",
      "Resignations over Roberts' remarks defending Carlson",
      "Over the following week, at least five members of the Heritage Foundation's antisemitism task force have resigned in protest over Roberts' initial social media post, CBS News has confirmed. Roberts' chief of staff also resigned after initially pushing back online, saying internal critics were \"virtue signaling\" and suggesting they should resign \"if so outraged\" over the comments.",
      "Economist Stephen Moore, the co-founder of the conservative organization Club for Growth, announced Thursday that he is resigning from his Heritage Foundation position as senior visiting fellow after 12 years in the role. A source familiar with his decision pointed to the controversy over Roberts' defense of Carlson and the ensuing backlash.",
      "Fuentes has a history of incendiary comments",
      "Fuentes, who found popularity in the far-right movement in the aftermath of the deadly \"Unite the Right\" rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, has a history of making antisemetic, misogynistic and racist comments.",
      "The 27-year-old political commentator has claimed the Holocaust was \"exaggerated,\" \"a lot of women want to be raped\" and White people are \"justified\" in being racist.",
      "Fuentes and his far-right online followers, who refer to themselves as \"groypers,\" have existed on the fringes of right-wing politics. Mr. Trump hosted Fuentes and rapper Kanye West at his Mar-a-Lago resort in 2022. But in an interview with \"Face the Nation\" in 2024, Vice President JD Vance disavowed Fuentes, who has questioned his loyalty to \"white identity,\" citing his interracial marriage.",
      "\"Do we really expect that the guy who has an Indian wife and named their kid Vivek is going to support white identity?\" Fuentes said.",
      "Vance responded on \"Face the Nation\" last year by calling Fuentes a \"total loser\" and saying his philosophy \"doesn't have any room in the MAGA movement.\"",
      "Fallout at Heritage over Roberts' defense of Carlson",
      "Roberts' comments drew condemnation from prominent conservatives like former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and commentator Ben Shapiro, who said the remarks \"betray the legacy of Heritage.\"",
      "On Oct. 31, in a lengthy post, Roberts elaborated on his comments about Fuentes, saying the Heritage Foundation denounces Fuentes' \"vicious antisemitic ideology, his Holocaust denial, and his relentless conspiracy theories that echo the darkest chapters of history\" and is \"disgusted\" by several of his other stances.",
      "\"Our task is to confront and challenge those poisonous ideas at every turn to prevent them from taking America to a very dark place. Join us \u2014 not to cancel \u2014 but to guide, challenge, and strengthen the conversation, and be confident as I am that our best ideas at the heart of western civilization will prevail,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "This week, Roberts faced intense criticism during an all-staff meeting on Wednesday, according to video of the nearly two-hour event obtained by the Washington Free Beacon. Some staff members called for Roberts' resignation and questioned his ability to continue to lead the organization.",
      "One attendee said she and others have no confidence in Roberts' leadership after the events of the last week and that he showed \"a stunning lack of both courage and judgment.\" Another attendee said \"enormous damage\" has been done to the Heritage Foundation's reputation.",
      "Roberts apologized while also blaming his now-former chief of staff for the original video, saying the former employee \"had the pen\" and had been made to believe that the script had been approved by a handful of other Heritage colleagues.",
      "\"I made a mistake and I let you down and I let down this institution,\" Roberts said. \"And I am sorry for that. Period. Full stop.\"",
      "He also apologized for using the phrase \"venomous coalition,\" which is seen as an antisemitic trope, calling it \"a terrible choice of words.\"",

      "A repeating bell sounded in the cockpit for 25 seconds as pilots tried to control a UPS cargo plane that caught fire, had an engine fall off and crashed during takeoff this week in Louisville, Kentucky, a National Transportation Safety Board member said Friday. The crash\u00a0killed at least 14 people, including the three pilots on board.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured a persistent bell that began about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, and the bell continued until the recording ended, which investigators believe was the final point of impact, NTSB member Todd Inman said.",
      "Inman said there could be different types of alarms with varying meanings, but investigators know there was a fire in the plane's left wing and will use flight data to help determine a clearer picture of what happened.",
      "The NTSB is leading the investigation. Inman said it would be months before the transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, told The Associated Press the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The AP after Inman's news conference Friday. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. ... They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "The crash happened Tuesday at UPS Worldport, the company's global aviation hub in Louisville. Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball.

      "Travis said his organization is working with NTSB investigators, but says he has no doubt the crew did everything they could to prevent this outcome.  \"Our training is robust,\" Travis said. \"Repeatedly, you are facing what it's like to fly the aircraft if you're missing an engine, or in some cases, two.

    "summary": "Mikie Sherrill flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters and won Latino men and women in her race for New Jersey governor.",
    "story": [
      "Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates in Tuesday's elections, largely reversing historic gains President Trump made in 2024 with this key demographic.",
      "Mr. Trump was a factor for voters generally, across Virginia, New Jersey, and California, according to CBS News exit polls \u2014 many said they voted in these races to oppose him.",
      "In New Jersey, 68% of Latino voters supported Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill, helping her defeat Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who was endorsed by Mr. Trump. Sherrill carried Latino men and women alike, and even flipped 18% of Latino Trump voters.",
      "Every New Jersey county voted more Democratic than in the 2024 presidential election. And Democrats swept the 10 counties where Latinos make up at least 20% of the population, expanding on their 2024 margins and flipping counties that Mr. Trump won in 2024.",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump made significant inroads in heavily Latino cities like Passaic with a 70% Latino population. He increased his vote margin by over 30 points and flipped the county, becoming the first Republican to win the presidential vote there in over 30 years.",
      "This year, these communities swung hard the other way, reversing Republican gains. Passaic flipped back to the Democratic column, giving Sherrill the same vote share Joe Biden enjoyed there in 2020. And in both Paterson and heavily Latino Prospect Park, Sherrill did even better.",
      "\"The thing that stands out the most to me is the amount of swing from Republican to Democrat in just one year,\" said Chuck Rocha a Democratic political strategist and CBS News contributor. \"We saw the swing of Latinos to the right slowly, progressively over the last 10 to 12 years, but on Tuesday night it was a real snapback \u2014 almost back to pre-Trump numbers of Latino performances for Democrats.\"",
      "In 2024, Mr. Trump received a higher percentage of the Latino vote than any other Republican presidential candidate in history. He won 46% of the Latino vote, coming very close to former Vice President Kamala Harris' vote share of 51%, according to CBS News exit polling. This was a dramatic improvement from Mr. Trump's showing of 28% in 2016.",
      "A precinct-level analysis of Passaic County reveals the types of places that shifted dramatically. About 16% of the county's precincts flipped from backing Mr. Trump last year to Sherrill this year, with no flips in the other direction.",
      "Moreover, it was areas with larger Latino populations that saw the biggest swings left. While some Latino Trump voters switched to vote Democratic this year, these shifts are also due to changes in turnout. Places with more Latinos saw greater churn in the electorate: that is, more of their 2024 voters skipped voting this year, and many of them were replaced with new voters who didn't vote last year (according to voter file data on this year's advance voters).",
      "Across the three cities mentioned above, along with Clifton, wards with more Latino residents both saw more churn and shifted more toward Democrats. Taken together, these data points and CBS News exit polling suggest that many of Trump's Latino voters stayed home, while others switched sides, and new voters broke heavily Democratic.",
      "In Virginia, Hispanic voters also swung for Democratic Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, who won 67% of their vote across the state. Mr. Trump made large gains in Manassas and Manassas Park in 2024, which are more than 40% Latino. In 2025, these two areas turned out for Spanberger.",
      "\"Certainly with the Latino community, economic issues, kitchen table issues, are always front of mind and always center in the decisions they're making,\" said Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin of the appeal of Democratic candidates to Latinos. \"You add on top of that, the fact that for many parts of this country, the Latino community has been terrorized with these mass thugs from ICE going out and indiscriminately pulling Latino from their cars.\"",
      "According to CBS News exit polls, 65% of Virginia Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, with the economy ranking as their highest priority.",
      "In New Jersey, 57% of Latino voters disapprove of Mr. Trump, and 53% feel the economy is not in good shape. On immigration, six in 10 Latinos feel the president's immigration actions have gone too far, and a similar number say the state's next governor should not cooperate with him.",
      "\"I predicted this was going to happen once the economy did not improve and once they started not deportation \u2014 but once they started deportations of non-criminal aliens and racial profiling \u2014 that there was gonna be a snapback,\" said Democratic Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona, who campaigned for both Spanberger and Sherrill.",
      "\"It's the same thing I saw in Arizona once there was racial profiling with Sheriff Joe Arpaio. You saw a mass mobilization of Latinos going out to not just protect themselves or protect their families,\" Gallego told CBS News, making reference to the former Maricopa County sheriff and anti-immigration hardliner. In 2024, Gallego won his U.S. Senate race, becoming Arizona's first Latino senator, as Mr. Trump won the state that year, largely on the strength of his outsized support from Latino male voters.",
      "In a recent UnidosUS bipartisan survey, 41% said they feared they or someone close to them might be arrested by federal immigration agents, despite having legal status.",
      "\"Unfortunately Latinos are leaving the Republican party after giving us a monumental chance in 2024,\" GOP Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said in a video posted on X after Tuesday's elections. She called the results \"a wake up call\" for the Republicans.",
      "\"I've said it before, the Hispanic vote is not guaranteed: Hispanics married President Trump, but they're only dating the GOP,\" Salazar said.",
      "The president said Wednesday, \"I don't think it was good for Republicans,\" regarding the election results. \"If you read the pollsters, the shutdown was a big factor, negative for the Republicans.\"",
      "The 2025 races garnered national attention as an early test of voter sentiment about Mr. Trump's second term and the ability of Democrats to counter Republicans ahead of the next year's pivotal midterm elections.",
      "Republicans have engaged in mid-decade redistricting in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina, at the behest of Mr. Trump, trying to boost GOP chances of winning seats and retain control over the House of Representatives.",
      "In Texas, Republicans redrew five Democratic congressional districts \u2014 including two in South Texas that will be competitive in 2026. Former Republican Rep. Mayra Flores is running for one of the newly drawn seats, Congressional District 34, and says she hopes to compound Mr. Trump's 2024 historic gains.",
      "In a phone interview, she praised Mr. Trump's second term, but said, \"Our focus needs to continue on bringing down the cost of living and improving the economy because the American people are struggling to live.\"",
      "Flores says Latino voters in South Texas largely supported Mr. Trump in 2024 because they wanted more border security, and she believes the GOP will be able to hold onto their votes next year.",
      "In the 2025 fiscal year, which just ended in September, unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to the lowest annual level since the early 1970s, as a result of the Trump administration's sweeping crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "\"We see firsthand what it looks like not to have law and order, and that is why Hispanics voted for President Trump,\" Flores said. \"We wanted law and order and continue to want law and order now more than ever.\"",

    "story": [
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss a mortgage fraud case against her, calling it a vindictive and politically motivated prosecution brought at the behest of a president who regards her as an enemy.",
      "The motion, which had been expected, argues the case against James was driven by personal \"animus\" that arose out of James' civil fraud lawsuit against President Trump and his companies in her capacity as state attorney general.",
      "\"This lawsuit, and AG James' outspoken criticism of the President, triggered six years of targeted attacks. President Trump and his allies have used every insulting term in their vocabulary to deride AG James and call for criminal penalties in retaliation for the exercise of her rights and fulfillment of her statutory duties to fulfill her obligations as New York state's attorney general,\" lawyers for James wrote in urging that the case be dismissed.",
      "The name-calling by Mr. Trump includes describing her as \"crooked,\" \"scum,\" \"a monster\" and \"criminal,\" according to the filing.",
      "The filing is similar to one from another of Mr. Trump's perceived adversaries, former FBI Director James Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to charges of making a false statement and obstructing Congress. Comey has said the case against him is similarly vindictive and inspired by the president's desire for retribution.",
      "James is accused of lying on mortgage papers to get favorable loan terms when purchasing a modest house in Norfolk, Virginia, where she has family. She pleaded not guilty last month, and told reporters outside the courthouse that the Trump administration was using the justice system as a \"tool of revenge.\"",
      "To bolster their claim of a vindictive prosecution, James' attorneys also assert that the Justice Department has singled her out for scrutiny \"while ignoring apparent inconsistencies in the mortgage records of numerous other public officials.\"",
      "They say the activities that form the basis of the indictment match the alleged conduct of other high-profile figures who have not been investigated or charged, including Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who was accused of identifying three houses as his first home.",
      "\"The only meaningful difference between AG James and these individuals is that AG James is a Democratic Attorney General who spoke out against the President, while the others are his allies and cabinet members,\" defense lawyers wrote.",
      "Like Comey, she was charged in Virginia by a hastily appointed U.S. attorney, Lindsey Halligan, a White House aide who was named to the post by Mr. Trump after the resignation of former acting U.S. attorney Erik Siebert.",
      "After Siebert's resignation, Mr. Trump, in a social media post, urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to look into James and other political foes, noting that he had been impeached and indicted himself multiple times. Trump wrote that the administration \"can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility,\" adding: \"JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "Friday's court filing criticized Halligan's ascension to the job, writing that \"the President removed what he viewed as the final roadblock to his plan\u2014interim U.S. Attorney Erik Siebert\u2014and installed his own lawyer, Ms. Halligan, with the singular mission of churning out indictments against his political enemies. Ms. Halligan promptly obeyed.\"",
      "Comey and James are separately challenging their indictments on the grounds that Halligan was illegally named to her job.",
      "James was first elected in 2018 as New York state's top lawyer, after holding elected jobs in New York City. She is the first woman elected as the state's attorney general.",
      "James has been a frequent target of Mr. Trump's, especially since she won a staggering judgment against the president and his companies in a lawsuit alleging he defrauded banks by overstating the value of his real estate holdings on financial statements. An appeals court overturned the fine, which had ballooned to more than $500 million with interest, but upheld a lower court's finding that Mr. Trump had committed fraud. Mr. Trump has denied all allegations against him.",

      "The National Park Service did not reply to Warren's inquiry, according to her office. Townsend referred further questions to the White House.",
      "\"If the Trust for the National Mall has become a tool for favor-seeking between billionaires and the President of the United States, the American people deserve to know,\" Warren said. \"I'll keep pushing to find out if the Trust is facilitating wink-and-nod arrangements between Trump and his billionaire ballroom donors \u2014 and what these donors are getting in return.\"",
      "Democrats lack subpoena power, so their letters amount to requests for information. The White House may volunteer information in response, but it's under no legal obligation to comply.

The Justice Department has also asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to block his order and requested a decision on its bid for emergency relief by 4 p.m.",
      "McConnell is overseeing a lawsuit brought by a group of cities and nonprofits after the USDA informed states late last month it would halt food assistance for November to Americans enrolled in the nutrition program because of the ongoing government shutdown.

      "The administration told the court Monday that it would comply with that order but said there was only enough reserve money to provide partial SNAP benefits. The USDA sent states the information needed to calculate the reduced payments to eligible Americans on Tuesday, but warned it could be weeks before the assistance reaches recipients.",

      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "summary": "The U.N. human rights chief warned that many Sudanese are still trapped in el-Fasher in the western Darfur region.",
    "story": [
      "Tens of thousands of Sudanese have fled to overcrowded camps to escape reported atrocities by a paramilitary force since it captured el-Fasher in the western Darfur region, an aid group said Saturday. The U.N.'s human rights chief warned that many others are still trapped.",
      "Those who reach shelter in Tawila, about 43 miles from el-Fasher, find themselves stranded in a barren area with barely enough tents, many of them improvised from patched tarps and sheets, according to a video posted by the group Sudan's IDPs and Refugee Camps. It shows children running across the area as a few adults carry a large pot of food, hoping it will be enough to feed the growing crowds of displaced.",
      "Since the Rapid Support Forces seized el-Fasher from the rival military Oct. 26, more than 16,200 people have fled to the camps in Tawila, said Adam Rojal, spokesperson for the aid group. The International Organization for Migration estimates that around 82,000 people had fled the city and surrounding areas as of Nov. 4, heading to safe spots including Tawila, an area already overcrowded with the displaced from previous attacks, with some making the journey on foot.",
      "The RSF and the Sudanese army have been at war since April 2023, following simmering tensions over control of Africa's third-largest nation. At least 40,000 people have been killed, according to the World Health Organization, though the actual toll might be many times higher. Some 12 million people have been displaced, and nearly half the population is facing acute food insecurity.",
      "Last week, the RSF seized el-Fasher after an 18-month siege. The paramilitary rampaged through the Saudi Hospital\u00a0in the city, killing over 450 people, according to the WHO, and went house to house, killing civilians and committing sexual assaults. The RSF has denied killing anyone at the Saudi hospital, but testimonies from those fleeing, online videos and satellite images offer an apocalyptic vision of the attack.",
      "The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Friday that 300 people arrived in Tawila on Thursday alone after fleeing el-Fasher. MSF teams reported \"extremely high levels of malnutrition among children and adults.\"",
      "The displaced in Tawila are in urgent need of food, medicine, shelter materials and psychosocial support, Rojal told The Associated Press. He said that families often survive on just two meals a day \u2014 and sometimes only one.",
      "U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker T\u00fcrk warned that those left behind in el-Fasher are at risk.",
      "\"Today, traumatized civilians are still trapped inside el-Fasher and are being prevented from leaving,\" he said Friday in Geneva.",
      "\"I fear that the abominable atrocities such as summary executions, rape and ethnically motivated violence are continuing within the city,\" he added. \"And for those who manage to flee, the violence does not end, as the exit routes themselves have been the scenes of unimaginable cruelty.\"",
      "On Thursday, the RSF said it has agreed to a humanitarian truce proposed by a U.S.-led mediator group known as the Quad. Meanwhile, the army said it welcomes the Quad's proposal, but will only agree to it if RSF withdraw from civilian areas and give up their weapons.",
      "The fighting has spread across Darfur and to the neighboring Kordofan region, with both emerging as the epicenter of Sudan's war over the past months. Early this week, a drone attack in el-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan province, killed at least 40 people and wounded dozens more.",
      "A military official told the AP on Saturday that the army intercepted two Chinese-made drones\u00a0that targeted el-Obeid on Saturday morning. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to disclose the information.",
      "Jalale Getachew Birru, an analyst for East Africa with Armed Conflict Location and Event Data, said in a statement Friday that the fall of el-Fasher and rising violence in North Kordofan mark a strategic victory for the RSF, but exacerbate human suffering. He estimated that at least 2,000 people were killed across Sudan in a single week between Oct. 26 and Nov. 1.",
      "\"These events not only deepen Sudan's humanitarian crisis but also signal the RSF's growing capacity to expand toward central Sudan, threatening to reverse the success of the Sudanese armed forces and returning the violence to the relatively calm central Sudan,\" said Birru.",

The Kremlin claims its only targets are linked to Kyiv's war effort. Russia's Defense Ministry asserted Saturday that the nighttime strikes hit military and energy sites supplying Ukrainian forces.",
      "Moscow and Kyiv have traded almost daily assaults on each other's energy targets as U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to stop the nearly four-year war had no impact on the battlefield.",
      "Ukraine's long-range drone strikes on Russian refineries aim to deprive Moscow of the oil export revenue it needs to pursue the war. Russia wants to cripple the Ukrainian power grid and deny civilians access to heat, light and running water in what Kyiv officials say is an attempt to \"weaponize winter.\"",
      "Russian forces, meanwhile, repelled a \"massive\" nighttime strike on energy facilities in the southern Volgograd region, its Gov.

    "summary": "After seven attempts, Ukrainian forces managed to extract a wounded comrade from Russian-occupied ground with a drone resembling an armored off-road casket.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian forces managed to rescue one of their own recently \u2014 a wounded soldier trapped for 33 days behind enemy lines \u2014 by sending a casket-shaped, off-road robot to navigate a perilous route dodging landmines and drone attacks to retrieve him.",
      "After six failed rescue attempts, the 1st Medical Battalion of the Ukrainian Ground Forces managed to rescue the soldier from Russian-occupied territory in the east of the country.",
      "The remotely operated robot, which looks like an armored casket mounted on an ATV frame and wheels, traveled a total of about 40 miles for the mission \u2014 almost 23 of them with a damaged wheel after it struck a landmine. The mission took just under six hours, according to the battalion, which shared a video of the operation on social media this week.",
      "\"We received a request from an adjacent unit to try to evacuate their soldier,\" the medical battalion's head of communications Volodymyr Koval told CBS News on Friday. \"They had already made four attempts on their own, but they were unsuccessful. They turned to us because we had the appropriate capabilities.\"",
      "The most important of those capabilities was the robot, a MAUL ground drone originally developed by the medical battalion precisely for the purpose of extracting wounded or trapped soldiers.",
      "\"The soldier's location was known, there was contact with him, food was being sent to him from the air \u2014 logistics were carried out by aerial drones. We began to develop a plan for his evacuation and study the route,\" Koval told CBS News. \"Two attempts were unsuccessful due to enemy mines and drones waiting on the ground in ambush on the roads. The seventh mission was successful, despite the fact that the drone hit an anti-personnel mine.\"",
      "The robot reached the soldier, who climbed into the personnel capsule, laid down and closed himself inside. But the rolling rescue unit then came under attack by a Russian drone on its way back toward the battle line. The soldier survived thanks to the armored capsule.",
      "Military medics provided first aid and stabilized the soldier as soon as the robot reached Ukrainian-controlled territory.",
      "\"The wounded warrior is now undergoing treatment and rehabilitation. His life has been saved,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a video statement Thursday evening. He lauded the troops of the 1st Medical Battalion for the operation, stressing the importance of such lifesaving missions and battlefield innovations.",
      "\"We will scale up exactly this kind of technological backbone for our army \u2014 more ground robotic systems operating at the front, more drones of all types, and increased deliveries of modern solutions that help achieve results in combat, in providing supplies for our combat units, and in evacuating our wounded warriors,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Koval told CBS News it was not the first and would likely not be the last ground-based drone evacuation carried out by the battalion.",
      "\"This is simply a special story of perseverance that carries an important message for the military and society. We are actively trying to implement unmanned evacuation from the battlefield, directly from the line of combat contact. This is the main task of our unit,\" he said. \"Evacuation is now very difficult due to the high density of fire, which is visible in the video. But every Ukrainian soldier must know that they will fight for him, that they will try to save him. This is what we wanted to show by telling this story.\"",
      "The MAUL robot used in the operation was originally designed by the 1st Medical Battalion, but is now made and sold by Ukrainian defense company DevDroid, which bought the license to the design.",
      "According to the battalion, the MAUL robot \"is an evacuation platform powered by an internal combustion engine, which allows it to reach speeds of up to 70 kph (43 mph). It has a special armored capsule to protect the wounded and special metal wheels that do not contain air.\"",
      "The units are now sold by DevDroid for about $19,000 each.",
      "Earlier this year, the Ukrainian National Guard's 13th Khartia Brigade used a Zmiy-500 ground drone, a simpler robot that offers less protection to the person riding it, to evacuate a wounded soldier while simultaneously delivering supplies to the front line, according to a social media post by the brigade.",
      "The drone covered more than 20 miles and completed the operation without incident, the brigade said.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 A convicted sex offender who was mistakenly released early from a London prison was re-arrested Friday after more than a week of freedom, police said.",
      "Brahim Kaddour-Cherif was one of two men set free in accidental releases from Wandsworth Prison over the past two weeks that have caused a political headache for the government and focused renewed attention on an overcrowded and overwhelmed prison system.",
      "The other inmate, Billy Smith, 35, who was sentenced to nearly four years for fraud and accidentally released on the same day as Cherif, turned himself in at the Victorian-era lockup on Thursday.",
      "Cherif, 24, a registered sex offender due to a previous indecent exposure conviction, was serving time for trespass with intent to steal. The Algerian national who overstayed a legal visit to the U.K. in 2019 was in the initial stages of deportation when he was allowed to walk off the prison ground on Monday.",
      "He was stopped by police in north London in an arrest filmed by national broadcaster Sky News. He initially denied he was the man they were looking for, but then said he wasn't to blame for being on the streets.",
      "\"I'm not Brahim, bro,\" he initially told a police officer, who said he recognized his distinctive nose. \"Everyone know him, he's in (the) news,\" Cherif said.",
      "After police officers pulled out their phones to look at the photo of the wanted man, he effectively admitted he was Cherif.",
      "\"It is not my fault,\" Cherif said. \"They released me illegally.\"",
      "Both men were wrongly freed from Wandsworth, which was built in southwest London in the middle of the 19th century, and was already under scrutiny after another prisoner escaped two years ago by clinging to the underside of a food delivery truck.",
      "The inadvertent releases followed more stringent security checks that were supposed to be in place after an asylum-seeker who inspired a rise of anti-immigrant protests was mistakenly freed from Chelmsford Prison, east of London, on Oct. 24.",
      "Prison chiefs were summoned to a meeting Thursday to discuss the errors and said efforts were being made to update a system that still uses paper prison records.",
      "The mistaken releases have become a source of heated debate and a political liability for the Labour government after being a thorn in the side of their Conservative predecessors.",
      "According to government figures, 262 prisoners were released in error in the year ending March 2025, a 128% increase on the previous 12-month period.",
      "Conservatives say the Labour government is to blame for a policy to release some inmates earlier to ensure prisons don't exceed capacity.",
      "But Labour has blamed 14 years of Conservative rule and years of austerity that has starved the Prison Service of resources.",
      "\"We inherited a prison system in crisis and I'm appalled at the rate of releases in error this is causing,\" Justice Secretary David Lammy said after the arrest. \"I'm determined to grip this problem, but there is a mountain to climb which cannot be done overnight.\"",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-ostrich-farm-cull-court-ruling-rfk-jr-dr-oz-intervention/",
    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 11:04:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A Canadian farm's fight to save its ostriches went all the way to the country's supreme court, and even drew an intervention from RFK Jr., but was lost in the end.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court of Canada on Thursday unanimously dismissed a last-ditch appeal by an ostrich farm in British Columbia to save its flock of hundreds of birds. The government issued a cull order for the farm's stock last year, and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said it would proceed with killing the ostriches to prevent an avian flu outbreak.",
      "\"The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) will be moving forward to complete depopulation and disposal measures as authorized by the Health of Animals Act and guided by the stamping out policy for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI),\" the CFIA said in a statement following the court's decision.",
      "The CFIA did not say how the ostriches would be killed, but multiple gunshots were heard at the Universal Ostrich Farm on Thursday night, according to Canadian media. The gunfire could be heard on a live video stream on farm spokesperson Katie Pasitney's Facebook page.",
      "Pasitney made an emotional plea to the Supreme Court to rule against the cull just before Thursday's court meeting, saying the birds were healthy and posed no threat.",
      "\"Supreme Court of Canada, they are healthy. They are everything that we have and everything that we loved for 35 years, please stop,\" she said in a video posted on social media.",
      "It has been nearly a year since over 300 ostriches on the farm became embroiled in a legal battle between the CFIA and their owners in Edgewood, British Columbia.",
      "In early December 2024, an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hit the farm, resulting in the deaths of nearly 70 birds within a few weeks. The CFIA described the outbreak as \"unprecedented\" and warned that it could have a significant impact on Canada's poultry industry, ordering a cull of the affected birds.",
      "\"You want to know what pain looks like?\" Pasitney asked in an emotional video posted online right after the court's decision on Thursday, showing her mother, the farm's owner, crying. \"She is going to lose everything she has ever loved for 35 years \u2026 that's what pain looks like when the government fails you.\"",
      "The CFIA said it takes its responsibility to protect the health of both animals and Canadians extremely seriously, and that it takes all disease control measures deemed necessary to protect health and trade.",
      "\"Given that the flock has had multiple laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 and the ongoing serious risks for animal and human health and trade, the CFIA continues planning for humane depopulation with veterinary oversight at the infected premises,\" the agency said.",
      "The case drew attention from the U.S. government, with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., along with the director of the National Institutes of Health and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, sending a letter to the head of the CFIA in May asking him to reconsider the cull, arguing that the ostriches could be valuable to study.",
      "\"We are respectfully requesting CFIA to consider not culling the entire flock of ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farm,\" Kennedy's letter said, \"given that a proportion of these ostriches were infected with avian influenza (H5N1) last year, we believe there is significant value in studying this population, for several reasons.\"",
      "In a follow-up letter in July, Kenndey urged the CFIA to delay the cull and proposed immediate collaboration between the CFIA, Canadian researchers and the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, offered the farm's owners the option of relocating the birds to his ranch in Florida, but the offer was turned down, according to Canada's national public broadcaster CBC.",
      "The CFIA said it would compensate the farm owners for the value of the animals, paying up to $2,200 per bird once supporting documentation was completed.",

      "The man informed the local authorities after he made the discovery in May, and they allowed him to keep the gold as it did not come from an archeological site, the council in the eastern town of Neuville-sur-Saone said on Wednesday.",
      "He found \"five gold bars and many coins\" buried in plastic bags, local newspaper Le Progres reported.",
      "Police found the gold had been acquired legally and had been melted down some \"15 or 20 years ago\" at a nearby refinery, it said.",
      "Because the gold bars had unique numbers that could be traced, police were able to determine that they had not been stolen, the outlet reported.",
      "According to Le Progres, France's 19th century civil code defines treasure as \"any hidden or buried thing over which no one can prove their ownership, and which is discovered purely by chance.\"",

      "The previous owner of the garden has died, the town hall said, and how the gold ended up there remains a mystery.",

      "London \u2014\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent a letter on Thursday to the former Prince Andrew, now Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, requesting that the disgraced British royal appear before Congress for questioning over his former ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"The Committee is seeking to uncover the identities of Mr. Epstein's co-conspirators and enablers and to understand the full extent of his criminal operations,\" said the letter, which was signed by the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Robert Garcia, and 14 others.",
      "\"Well-documented allegations against you, along with your long-standing friendship with Mr. Epstein, indicate that you may possess knowledge of his activities relevant to our investigation. In the interest of justice for the victims of Jeffrey Epstein, we request that you cooperate with the Committee's investigation by sitting for a transcribed interview with the Committee,\" the American lawmakers said.",
      "Neither Garcia nor the committee has the power to subpoena Andrew, who was formally stripped of the title of prince on Thursday.",
      "No Republicans on the House committee signed the letter.",
      "The communication cited Andrew's widely reported friendship with Epstein, which continued after the American financier's 2008 conviction for procuring minors for prostitution. It also mentioned Andrew's visits to Epstein's residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Epstein's trip to the late Queen Elizabeth II's residence at Balmoral in Scotland.",
      "\"This close relationship with Mr. Epstein, coupled with the recently revealed 2011 email exchange in which you wrote to him 'we are in this together,' further confirms our suspicion that you may have valuable information about the crimes committed by Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators,\" the letter said.",
      "It also cited a number of allegations by the late Virginia Giuffre, including that she was \"lent out\" to Andrew by Epstein on a number of occasions.",
      "\"In response to a subpoena issued to the Epstein estate, the Committee has identified financial records containing notations such as \"massage for Andrew\" that raise serious questions regarding the nature of your relationship with Mr. Epstein and related financial transactions,\" the letter said.",
      "The House Democrats also mentioned Giuffre's memoir, which was published posthumously this year, in which she mentioned her fear of Andrew retaliating if she publicized allegations against him.",
      "\"This fear of retaliation has been a persistent obstacle to many of those who were victimized in their fight for justice. In addition to Mr. Epstein's crimes, we are investigating any such efforts to silence, intimidate, or threaten victims, and are interested in any avenues that may further shed light on these activities,\" the letter said.",
      "Andrew was asked to respond to the letter by Nov. 20th, \"due to the urgency and gravity of this matter.\"",
      "He was stripped of both his \"Royal Highness\" and \"prince\" titles on Thursday, and last month he gave up other royal titles, including \"Duke of York.\"",
      "He had already stepped down from public duties as a member of the royal family in 2019, after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",
      "Though much of the national and global attention focused on the more than 200 dead dolphins recorded in under two months, they represented only the tip of a wider socio-ecological crisis, with fish also dying in droves.",
      "There was even a phytoplankton bloom that turned the lake red as the algae came under stress -- the subject of another forthcoming paper Fleischmann co-authored.",
      "To understand longer-term trends, the researchers combed back through NASA satellite data beginning in 1990, finding that Amazonian lakes have been warming at roughly 0.6C per decade, higher than the global average.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here, there is no doubt about it,\" said Fleischmann.",
      "He added he would be attending the COP30 summit to advocate for long-term monitoring of the Amazon's lakes and for greater inclusion of local populations -- including Indigenous peoples, non-Indigenous riverine dwellers, and Afro-descendant communities -- in developing solutions.",
      "Research\u00a0published in the journal Hydrological Processes found that droughts \"have significant implications for river water temperature extremes\" as radiation during these periods is more intense while water levels are lower and river velocities slow.",
      "\"Rising river water temperatures can have significant and often detrimental implications for aquatic life, impacting both individual species and entire ecosystems,\" study co-author and University of Birmingham professor\u00a0David Hannah\u00a0said. \"Drought conditions often coincide with high atmospheric temperatures and such trends will become more intense and frequent with climate change.\"",

      "Hegseth released aerial footage on X of the latest strike, which he said took place in international waters like the previous attacks and targeted \"a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organization.\"",
      "The video showed a boat traveling through the water before exploding into flames.",

      "Like some previous videos released by the U.S. government, a section of the boat is obfuscated for unspecified reasons.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration has built up significant forces in Latin America, in what it says is its campaign to stamp out drug trafficking.",

      "Maduro \u2014 who has been indicted on drug charges in the United States \u2014 insists there is no drug cultivation in his country, which he says is used as a trafficking route for Colombian cocaine against its will.",

      "Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio briefed a small group of congressional leaders Wednesday on the growing military campaign, providing one of the first high-level glimpses into the legal rationale and strategy behind the strikes.",

      "Dilling has been under RSF siege since June 2023.",

      "Multiple reports by outside monitoring groups suggest large-scale atrocities in El-Fasher since the RSF took the city.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans blocked a war powers resolution on Thursday aimed at preventing President Trump from conducting strikes against Venezuela after a bipartisan group of senators warned that a continued campaign against alleged drug smugglers in the region could escalate.",
      "The vote to advance the resolution failed with 49 supporting it and 51 senators opposing. Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska were the only Republicans to support it.",
      "The resolution, led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine, would direct the president \"to terminate the use of United States Armed Forces for hostilities within or against Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific authorization for use of military force.\" The resolution had 15 cosponsors, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California and Paul.",
      "\"Congress should not cede its power to any president,\" Kaine told reporters at the Capitol on Thursday. \"If colleagues believe that a war against the narco-traffickers in the ocean or a war against Venezuela is a good idea, then put an [authorization of military force] on the table and debate and vote it, but don't just hand the power over to an executive. That runs against everything that this nation was founded on.\"",
      "The U.S. military is building up forces in waters off South America and has conducted at least 17 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific since Sept. 2, killing at least 70 people. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the most recent strike hours after the Senate voted, saying three \"narco-terrorists\" were killed in the Caribbean.",
      "Kaine introduced the bipartisan resolution on Oct. 16, one day after Mr. Trump confirmed that he had authorized the CIA to conduct covert operations inside Venezuela.",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in through the sea,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"But we're going to stop them by land also.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said last week he had not made a decision about strikes within Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration recently began briefing lawmakers on the strikes ahead of Thursday's vote, allowing them to read the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel opinion that the administration argues justifies the strikes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth met with congressional leaders and national security committee heads on Wednesday as lawmakers in both parties demand more details on the intelligence and legal basis for the strikes.",
      "Democrats left the briefing saying that the administration's answers on the legal rationale were insufficient, but expressed confidence in the U.S. intelligence community's capabilities.",
      "\"Nothing in the legal opinion even mentions Venezuela,\" said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee.",
      "Warner added that intelligence assets on alleged drug trafficking operations in the region are \"quite good,\" but argued that the U.S. should be intercepting the boats and bringing the alleged traffickers to justice.",
      "\"I'm not too worried that they're going to take out a fishing boat, because our intelligence community is very, very good. But I'm not confident that we know precisely who are in those boats and why they're there,\" said Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, disagreed with the characterization, telling reporters that \"we know the contents of the boats\" and \"we know the personnel, almost to a person.\"",
      "Kaine said Thursday the Office of Legal Counsel opinion is based on a misreading of constitutional text. Schiff added that the opinion \"is broad enough to authorize just about anything.\"",
      "\"If that opinion were to be adopted, it would not constrain any use of force anywhere in the world,\" he said.",
      "Schiff also questioned the U.S. military buildup in the region, calling it \"an open secret that this is much more about potential regime change.\" In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week, Mr. Trump said Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's days are numbered. After Wednesday's briefing, Himes, a Democrat, said \"there is no apparent plans to expand this beyond what they say that they are doing.\"",
      "Kaine said some of his Republican colleagues are uncomfortable with the potential for escalation, but have not told him they plan to support his resolution. Schiff added that some of them \"may have been more comfortable with the idea when they thought it was a very short campaign, but now that it is an ongoing thing with no definite endpoint, I think the concern has increased.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution would require the U.S. to remove its armed forces from \"hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" It said U.S. actions in the region \"indicate imminent involvement\" in hostilities within or against the South American nation.",
      "In October, Senate Republicans blocked a similar effort aimed at preventing continued U.S. strikes on alleged drug-carrying boats off the coast of Venezuela. Kaine said he and Schiff planned to keep renewing their efforts to force votes on the war powers issue.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. In emergency situations, the administration must report to Congress within 48 hours and cease hostilities within 60 days absent congressional authorization. The 60-day deadline expired Monday.",
      "When asked how the administration plans to proceed, a senior administration official told CBS News that the 1973 resolution \"has been understood to apply to placing U.S. servicemembers in harm's way.\" The strikes have been largely carried out by drones launched from naval vessels \"at distances too far away for the crews of the targeted vessels to endanger American personnel,\" according to the official. The official added that the administration does not consider the strikes against the alleged drug traffickers as \"hostilities.\"",
      "In a floor speech on Oct. 8, Paul said the strikes risk killing innocent people and decried the lack of due process.",
      "\"If anyone gave a you-know-what about justice, perhaps those in charge of deciding whom to kill might let us know their names, present proof of their guilt, show evidence of their crimes,\" Paul said. \"Is it too much to ask to know the names of those we kill before we kill them? To know what evidence exists of their guilt? At the very least, the government should explain how the gang came to be labeled as terrorists.\"",
      "On Thursday, Paul asked why the two survivors were repatriated if they were such a threat to the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Kazakhstan is set to join the Abraham Accords between Israel and Muslim majority countries, in a symbolic move aimed at boosting an initiative that was a hallmark of President Trump's first term.",
      "The action, announced Thursday, is largely symbolic as Kazakhstan has had diplomatic relations with Israel since 1992 and is much farther geographically from Israel than the other Abraham Accord nations \u2014 Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Those four countries agreed to normalize relations with Israel as a result of joining the accords, something Kazakhstan did shortly after gaining independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union.",
      "Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Truth Social that he'd hosted a \"great call\" between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. He wrote that Kazakhstan is the \"first Country of my Second Term to join the Abraham Accords, the first of many.\"",
      "Trump called Kazakhstan's joining \"a major step forward in building bridges across the World\" and said \"more Nations are lining up to embrace Peace and Prosperity through my Abraham Accords.\"",
      "A signing ceremony would soon make it official, Mr. Trump said, and \"there are many more Countries trying to join this club of STRENGTH.\"",
      "Later Thursday, Mr. Trump hosted a summit with the leaders of Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian nations, during which the president said more countries could join the Abraham Accords.",
      "Asked by reporters what Kazakhstan's entry into the accords will mean, given that Kazakhstan and Israel already had long-standing ties, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it an \"enhanced relationship, beyond just diplomatic relations and having embassies in each other's capitals.\"",
      "\"You're now creating a partnership that brings special and unique economic development on all sorts of issues that they can work on together,\" Rubio said.",
      "U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Kazakhstan's participation in the Abraham Accords with Israel was important as it would enhance their bilateral trade and cooperation and signaled that Israel is becoming less isolated internationally, notably after massive criticism and protests over its conduct in the war against Hamas in Gaza.",
      "One official maintained that Mr. Trump's nascent peace plan for Gaza had \"completely changed the paradigm\" and that many countries were now willing to \"move toward the circle of peace\" that it had created.",
      "That official said specific areas of enhanced Israeli-Kazakh cooperation would include defense, cybersecurity, energy and food technology, although all of those have been subjects of previous bilateral agreements dating back to the mid-1990s.",

    "summary": "Archaeologists discovered evidence of an ancient religious group while excavating an area in northern Israel, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Archaeologists have discovered evidence of an ancient religious practice in northern Israel in addition to a wine press dating back roughly 5,000 years \u2014 one of the oldest ever uncovered in the country, according to the\u00a0Israel Antiquities Authority.",
      "The wine press, which is likewise the earliest relic of wine production in Israel, was found during an excavation at the archaeological site Tel Megiddo, said the agency, which noted that the work was conducted ahead of the planned construction of a highway through the same area.",
      "Officials said the wine press, which was carved from stone, was evidence that a Canaanite religious group existed at the site thousands of the years ago. The Canaanites were ancient indigenous people who inhabited the area known as Canaan, which was located in \"the Levant\" along the eastern Mediterranean Sea, from Greece to western Europe, according to EBSCO. They were a group of mixed ethnicities although the Hebrew Bible distinguishes them from Israelites and teaches that Israelites arrived later than they did.",
      "Dr. Amir Golani and Barak Tzin, excavation directors for the Israel Antiquities Authority, said the wine press discovery was unprecedented.",
      "\"Until now, indirect evidence indicated that wine could have been produced 5,000 years ago, but we did not have conclusive proof of this \u2013 a 'smoking gun' that would clearly show when this happened in our area,\" they said in a statement. \"This wine press finally provides new and clear evidence that early wine production actually took place here.\"",
      "In addition to the wine press, archaeologists found a model of a small temple and one set of ceremonial utensils, which were approximately 3,300 years old. Those were among a wider collection of items found during excavations in the region, which covered about three-fourths of a mile and \"uncovered many finds from different periods,\" the authority said. Their discoveries spanned the early Bronze Age, which ran from about 3300 to 3000 B.C.E., and the late Bronze Age, which ran from about 1550 to 1400 B.C.E.",
      "There was more evidence of early Canaanite populations in the area, the authority said. They included residential buildings uncovered around the wine press, ritual vessels and pottery imported from Cyprus, which are thought to illuminate some of the ancient peoples' ritual ceremonies and cultures.",
      "The new discoveries were put on display Thursday at the annual conference on innovations and research in Israeli excavations, which was organized by the Israel Antiquities Authority an the School of Archaeology and Maritime Civilizations at the University of Haifa.",

      "\"The artifacts were handed over by the American authorities to the Egyptian Embassy in the U.S., and they arrived in Egypt about two weeks ago,\" Nevine El-Aref, the ministry's media adviser, told CBS News.",
      "Three main sets of artifacts were recovered, the first consisting of 11 items handed over by the New York State Attorney General's office. Among them is a mummy burial mask that belonged to a young man from the Roman era, a vessel in the shape of the god Bes, and a limestone funerary stelae, an inscribed tablet, also from the Roman period.",
      "In May, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said it had returned 11 antiquities to the people of Egypt that were recovered thanks to multiple criminal investigations.",
      "\"Eleven more priceless antiquities have now been recovered and returned to where they rightfully belong,\" District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said in a statement at the time. \"None of this work is possible without the dedication and commitment of our team, and I thank them for their work on these investigations.\"",
      "The second group was handed over by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Egyptian Consulate in New York. It includes 24 rare manuscripts bearing writings in the ancient Coptic and Syriac languages.",
      "The third group consisted of a colored plaster panel from the 18th Dynasty, about 3,000 years ago, that was confiscated by the New York State Attorney General's office after it was determined to have been illegally removed from Egypt.",
      "\"Any artifact that belongs to Egypt's heritage is important. Even if it's a small stone, it is important to bring it back to Egypt, where it belongs,\" El-Aref told CBS News. \"It is very important for Egypt to preserve its archaeological heritage and its history and pass it on to the next generations.\"",
      "An archaeological committee received the pieces, which will be displayed at the Egyptian Museum in central Cairo after they're restored, the ministry said.",
      "Egyptian officials are constantly monitoring the internet to detect illegally smuggled artifacts, and whenever something surfaces online, they collaborate with authorities around the globe to bring them home, El-Aref said.",
      "The prime minister of the Netherlands said just days ago that his country would return a stolen 3,500-year-old sculpture to Egypt. His announcement came after he attended the Grand Egyptian Museum's official opening ceremony on November 1.",

    "story": [
      "Rome \u2014\u00a0Pope Leo XIV met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the Vatican on Thursday, marking their first in-person encounter since the Chicago native was chosen to lead the Catholic Church in May. The two had spoken previously on the phone.",
      "The hour-long meeting, described by the Holy See as \"cordial,\" focused on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and renewed calls for a two-state solution, a position the Vatican has consistently promoted as the only viable path to peace between Israelis and Palestinians.",
      "The talks came nearly a month after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took hold in Gaza, bringing a fragile calm following two years of conflict that began with Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel.",
      "According to a Vatican statement, both leaders agreed on \"the urgent need to provide assistance to the civilian population in Gaza,\" and to \"end the conflict by pursuing a two-state solution,\" which would see an independent Palestinian state created alongside Israel.",
      "Abbas' visit also marked the 10th anniversary of the \"Comprehensive Agreement\" signed in 2015 between the Holy See and the State of Palestine \u2014 which saw the Vatican, like a rising number of countries, formally recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Abbas, the President of the Palestinian Authority, which partially administers some of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but holds no sway in Gaza, arrived in Rome on Wednesday and visited the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he laid flowers at the tomb of the late Pope Francis, whom he called \"a great friend of Palestine.\"",
      "For Abbas, the meeting offered an opportunity to reaffirm international backing for a Palestinian state at a time when the idea seems increasingly remote on the ground.",
      "Abbas has said the PA, which he heads, is ready to step into post-war Gaza to administer the densely populated territory, but Netanyahu's government has rejected any future role for the PA or Hamas in the strip. Netanyahu has also clearly ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state while he is prime minister, and his coalition government includes hard-line factions that espouse building Israeli settlements in the strip instead.",
      "The American pope has echoed his predecessor's support for Palestinian rights while striking a less critical tone on Israel.",
      "He has condemned the forced displacement of civilians in Gaza and called for sustained humanitarian aid, but stopped short of labeling Israel's military operation against Hamas in the territory as \"genocide,\" as Pope Francis did late in his pontificate.",
      "The Vatican's continued advocacy for a two-state solution underscores a broader reality: While the concept remains a cornerstone of international diplomacy \u2014 championed by most governments worldwide and the United Nations, though not clearly by the Trump administration \u2014 it carries less traction in the region itself.",
      "Recent polling shows that most Israelis and Palestinians no longer believe such an arrangement is feasible.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/putin-nuclear-weapons-tests-proposals-trump-comments/",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 10:21:33 -0500",
    "summary": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia has adhered to a ban on nuclear test explosions after President Trump claimed Moscow is testing nuclear weapons.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed his government to submit proposals on the possible resumption of nuclear weapons testing in response to President Trump instructing the Pentagon to do so \"on an equal basis\" with other countries.",
      "In a meeting Wednesday with his Security Council, Putin said Russia has adhered to the international Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits nuclear test explosions.",
      "But, he said, \"if the United States or any other state party to the Treaty was to conduct such tests, Russia would be under obligation to take reciprocal measures.\"",
      "Mr. Trump claimed in an\u00a0interview with 60 Minutes\u00a0that Russia is among a handful of countries testing nuclear weapons when asked about his order.",
      "\"Russia's testing, and China's testing, but they don't talk about it,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News correspondent Norah O'Donnell. \"We're gonna test, because they test and others test. And certainly North Korea's been testing. Pakistan's been testing.\"",
      "It is unclear what type of testing Mr. Trump is ordering. The last time the U.S. detonated a nuclear device as part of a test was in 1992.",
      "\"No one knows what Trump meant about 'nuclear testing' (he probably doesn't himself),\" Dmirty Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia's Security Council, wrote in a post on social media Wednesday.",
      "\"But he's the president of the United States,\" his post continued. \"And the consequences of such words are inescapable: Russia will be forced to assess the expediency of conducting full-fledged nuclear tests itself.\"",
      "China was the first of the nations accused by Mr. Trump to deny any secret nuclear testing. A Pakistani official told CBS News that the country \"will not be the first to resume nuclear tests.\"",
      "Mr. Trump made the assertion to O'Donnell just days after the president's own nominee to lead STRATCOM \u2014 the U.S. military command in charge of nuclear weapons \u2014 told lawmakers on Capitol Hill that neither China nor Russia were conducting nuclear explosive tests.",
      "North Korea is the only nation known to have conducted a nuclear detonation since the 1990s. Russia's last known nuclear explosive test was in 1990, and China's was in 1996.",
      "The U.S. is among almost 180 nations that have signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.",
      "Along with China and several other nuclear powers, however, the U.S. has never ratified the treaty, a situation that Putin highlighted in 2023 when he decided to\u00a0revoke Moscow's ratification.",
      "While Russia has stepped up its own tests of nuclear-capable and even\u00a0nuclear-powered weapons systems, it has not announced any resumption of nuclear test detonations.",
      "Putin's revocation of Russia's CTBT ratification exactly two years ago fueled speculation that he could order new nuclear detonation tests, along with calls from hawkish members of the Russian parliament for the country to do so. Putin previously suggested that Russia would resume nuclear explosive tests if the U.S. were to do so first.",
      "One year ago, Putin approved changes to Russia's official nuclear doctrine, formally amending the conditions \u2014 and lowering the threshold \u2014 under which Moscow would consider using its nuclear weapons.",
      "The updated doctrine, which was announced just as Ukraine launched its first strike deeper into Russia with U.S.-supplied missiles, states that Russia will treat an attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a country with nuclear capabilities as a joint attack by both.",
      "That means in theory that any attack on Russia by a country that's part of a coalition could be seen as an attack by the entire group. Under the doctrine, Russia could theoretically consider any major attack on its territory, even with conventional weapons, by non-nuclear-armed Ukraine sufficient to trigger a nuclear response, because Ukraine is backed by the nuclear-armed United States.",
      "Putin has threatened to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine multiple times since he ordered the full-scale invasion of the country on Feb. 24, 2022, and Russia has repeatedly warned the West that if Washington allowed Ukraine to fire Western-made missiles deep into its territory, it would consider the U.S. and its NATO allies to be directly involved in the war.",
      "Mr. Trump has so far declined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's repeated requests for U.S.-made Tomahawk long-range missiles.",
      "What does Trump mean by U.S. resuming nuclear tests?",
      "Mr. Trump has not been clear about whether his stated plan to have the U.S. military test its nuclear arsenal includes conducting actual atomic explosions, which have not been carried out in the U.S. for over 30 years, or just expanded testing of the weapons systems used to deliver nuclear warheads.",
      "U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who was appointed by Mr. Trump, downplayed the notion on Sunday that the U.S. was about to start setting off nuclear explosions.",
      "\"I think the tests we're talking about right now are system tests. These are not nuclear explosions,\" Wright told Fox News. \"These are what we call 'non-critical explosions,' so you're testing all the other parts of a nuclear weapon to make sure they deliver the appropriate geometry and they set up the nuclear explosion.\"",
      "Speaking on Wednesday with CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio, Japanese security analyst Narushige Michishita said if the U.S. does resume nuclear explosives testing, it would be \"good news and bad news.\"",
      "\"Good news is that the U.S. is serious in bolstering its nuclear deterrence,\" said Michishita, the executive vice president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and Non-Resident Fellowship at the Atlantic Council. He explained that Japan, as a non-nuclear armed nation, relies heavily on the deterrent protection offered by its American allies, amid heightened tension with its neighbor China.",
      "\"But at the same time,\" he said the government and people of Japan \u2014 the only country on earth to ever have had\u00a0nuclear weapons used\u00a0against it in warfare \u2014 \"have been working very hard to create a world without nuclear weapons.\"",
      "If he could sit down for a candid conversation with President Trump, Michishita said he \"would like to tell him to think in an objective and very sober and low-key manner, without exaggerating or without agitation, agitating the crisis, think about how to enhance the credibility of nuclear deterrence and take necessary steps, while sending the message to the world that we must not fight nuclear war again.\"",

    "story": [
      "A New Zealand wildlife park that said it was being forced to euthanize seven elderly lions because of financial difficulties has put down two of the big cats.",
      "The Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary said on Tuesday that it had no choice but to euthanize the animals. Rehoming the big cats was not a \"viable or humane option\" because of their \"age, number and complex needs,\" the sanctuary said in an updated statement on Thursday. The lions are between the ages of 18 and 21, which is longer than they would have lived in the wild.",
      "The park said two lions, named Imvula and Sibili, were put down on Wednesday. Both animals had \"serious health conditions that were not treatable and were deteriorating,\" the sanctuary said, and the decision to euthanize them was \"made with deep care and consideration.\"",
      "The sanctuary said the five surviving lions' wellbeing continues to be their priority and that they are still seeking a solution for the surviving lions. Some have expressed interest in purchasing the park and continuing to care for the lions, the sanctuary said, which provides \"a glimmer of hope.\"",
      "\"While the timeframe is short and the situation remains uncertain, we are doing everything we can to explore this possibility and keep hope alive,\" the park wrote on social media. The sanctuary did not specify how much time the remaining lions might have.",
      "The park said it had received supportive condolences and \"threatening and abusive messages\" since announcing the need to euthanize the lions. The sanctuary asked for \"kindness and respect as we navigate this heartbreaking situation.\"",
      "The park's website features 12 lions and one Bengal tiger. The zoo did not say what was going to happen to the five lions who are not set to be euthanized. Taking care of big cats \"comes at an enormous cost,\" according to the park's website. The sanctuary has previously solicited donations of unwanted cows or horses to feed the animals, which eat about three cows' worth of meat each week.",

    "story": [
      "A search continued on Thursday for one of two convicted criminals who were mistakenly released from prison the previous day in Britain \u2014 the second and third such incidents in two weeks and part of a growing trend of mistaken releases that have put the government under fire.",
      "London's Metropolitan Police said it was informed by England's prison service on Tuesday afternoon that a 24-year-old was \"released in error\" from Wandsworth prison, in southwest London, on Oct. 29.",
      "The suspect has been identified as Algerian national Brahim Kaddour Cherif, who remained at large on Thursday. Police said he is a registered sex offender who was convicted of indecent exposure last year, sentenced to an 18-month community order and put on the sex offenders' register for five years.",
      "The BBC reported that Cherif last appeared in court in September, charged with failing to comply with requirements for convicted sex offenders.",
      "\"Cherif has had a six-day head start but we are working urgently to close the gap and establish his whereabouts,\" Paul Trevers, who is overseeing the police investigation, said in a statement.",
      "The second man mistakenly released, 35-year-old William Smith, was let go from the same prison as Cherif on Monday, the Surrey Police said, but the force issued an update on Thursday to say he had turned himself back in at Wandsworth Prison in South London.",
      "He was released the same day he appeared at a hearing where he received a 45-month sentence for multiple fraud offenses.",
      "In a statement shared Thursday on social media, the Surrey Police thanked members of the public for sharing its appeal for information on Smith, and said it was canceling its request for help to find him.",
      "\"I am absolutely outraged and appalled by the mistaken release of a foreign criminal wanted by the police. The Metropolitan police is leading an urgent manhunt, and my officials have been working through the night to take him back to prison,\" David Lammy, U.K. deputy prime minister and justice secretary, said in a statement after reports emerged of the first mistaken release, according to the BBC.",
      "\"Victims deserve better and the public deserve answers. That is why I have already brought in the strongest checks ever to clamp down on such failures and ordered an independent investigation, led by Dame Lynne Owens to uncover what went wrong and address the rise in accidental releases which has persisted for too long,\" Lammy said.",
      "A spokesperson for U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer called that release \"utterly unacceptable\" and said the issue of accidental prisoner releases \"needs to be dealt with, and the system needs to be reformed and the appropriate checks need to be in place to stop this type of thing from ever happening,\" according to The Guardian.",
      "Just last week, the accidental release of Hadush Kebatu, an Ethiopian man jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl, triggered a two-day manhunt and his eventual deportation. British authorities agreed to give him the equivalent of about $600 to get on a plane, rather than filing a new legal challenge to his deportation.",
      "The number of prisoners released from U.K. prisons by mistake has more than doubled in the last year, according to government data analyzed by Britain's Telegraph newspaper.",
      "About 262 prisoners were mistakenly released from March 2024 to March 2025, compared to 115 during the same period the previous year, the Telegraph reported.",
      "An official review of the issue has begun, but Ian Acheson, a former prison governor and adviser to U.K. government ministers, cited the overcrowding of Britain's prisons as a reason for the rise in accidental releases.",
      "Overcrowding has brought more pressure on the prison managers to get offenders out as quickly as possible, which has led to more movement of prisoners within the prison system, Acheson told the Telegraph newspaper.",
      "\"It is quite possible that one of the reasons for the increase in these mistakes has been the push and imperative to get people out,\" Acheson told the Telegraph.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Nov 2025 20:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country that U.N. experts warn could be sliding \"back toward another deadly war.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Department of Homeland Security is planning to terminate Temporary Protected Status for nationals of South Sudan imminently, CBS News has exclusively learned. The change will end more than a decade of protection that allowed thousands of displaced South Sudanese nationals to live and work legally in the United States.",
      "According to DHS officials, the decision by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem came after consultation with the State Department and other federal agencies.",
      "Despite recent warnings from the United Nations and other organizations that South Sudan could actually be slipping back into a state of open warfare, DHS officials pointed to the end of an armed conflict, improved diplomatic relations and South Sudan's expressed commitment to reintegrating any returning nationals, adding that continuing the TPS designation for South Sudan would be \"contrary\" to U.S. interests.",
      "The designation lapsed on November 3, 2025, and a DHS official tells CBS News that a formal notice of termination will be published in the Federal Register later this week, triggering a 60-day grace period for South Sudanese nationals to depart the country or face deportation once their status officially expires in January. DHS estimates that roughly 5,000 South Sudanese nationals are currently living in the United States.",
      "Over the past 14 years, under the program, South Sudanese nationals who could not safely return to their home country due to armed conflict and environmental disaster were shielded from deportation and allowed to work legally in the U.S. The designation dated back to a period of rampant instability that began when the young nation first gained its independence in 2011. Multiple presidential administrations had since extended the program.",
      "South Sudan's TPS designation was most recently renewed for 18 months, from November 4, 2023, to May 3, 2025, by then-DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \"due to ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions in South Sudan that prevent individuals from safely returning.\" It was then extended automatically for six months, through November 3, after DHS did not complete a required review before a statutory 60-day window passed.",
      "The termination marks a significant shift in U.S. policy toward South Sudan, a country still struggling to recover from years of civil war and humanitarian crises. While DHS says conditions have improved, humanitarian groups and regional experts caution that peace remains fragile, with deepening economic distress creating challenges for any safe return.",
      "U.N. says \"all indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war\"",
      "International mediators have reported some progress toward implementing a peace agreement and transitional governance framework, despite violence, corruption and weak state institutions hampering humanitarian access. But the U.S. State Department maintains a\u00a0Level 4 \"Do Not Travel\" advisory for South Sudan, citing persistent armed conflict, crime and kidnapping.",
      "According to the\u00a0Council on Foreign Relations, armed clashes among government troops, opposition forces and ethnic militias continue to claim lives and displace civilians.",
      "The United Nations has documented widespread human rights abuses, including the\u00a0recruitment of child soldiers, sexual violence and arbitrary detentions, and the global body's human rights chief warned as recently as September that the fragile truce could crumble.",
      "\"With fears of a collapse of the 2018 Revitalized Peace Agreement and a return to widespread violence intensifying, I deeply worry for the plight of civilians in South Sudan,\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said in late September.",
      "More recently, a U.N. commission on human rights in the country warned the U.N. General Assembly at the end of October that \"South Sudan's political transition is falling apart.\"",
      "\"The ceasefire is not holding, political detentions have become a tool of repression, the peace agreement's key provisions are being systematically violated, and the Government forces are using aerial bombardments in civilian areas. All indicators point to a slide back toward another deadly war,\" commissioner Barney Afako told the U.N.",
      "The U.N.'s\u00a0World Food Program\u00a0has also warned that ongoing conflict, flooding and food insecurity are worsening humanitarian conditions in the country.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the population \u2014 an estimated 9 million people \u2014 require humanitarian assistance, while 7.7 million face acute food insecurity, according to the Congressional Research Service and the\u00a0U.N. Population Fund.",
      "In the run-up to the official termination, DHS is now urging South Sudanese nationals who choose to depart voluntarily to use the Customs and Border Protection \"CBP Home\" mobile app to report their departure. The app, according to the department, offers a \"safe, secure\" way to self-deport, including a complimentary plane ticket, an exit bonus of $1,000 and potential pathways for future legal immigration to the United States, although DHS has not outlined what those pathways might look like.",

      "\"There were no real options left. The staff and I are devastated,\" sanctuary operator Janette Vallance said in a statement on Tuesday.",

      "\"We are currently running low so your donations are greatly appreciated,\" the park says.",
      "The sanctuary drew minor fame in the early 2000s when it featured on a television show about celebrity big cat handler Craig \"the Lion Man\" Busch.",
      "Busch was later accused of a string of animal rights abuses, such as keeping animals in sub-standard cages.",
      "A keeper was mauled to death by a white tiger inside the park in 2009. After that incident, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry ordered the temporary closure of the sanctuary, RNZ reported.",
      "The sanctuary features 12 lions\u00a0and one Bengal tiger on its website. The park says that big cats born abroad arrived in New Zealand between the ages of 6 months and 3 years.",
      "In the early 2000s, Kamo Wildlife Sanctuary was home to 33 big cats, including lions, tigers, leopards and cheetahs, according to RNZ.",

      "\"At 75, both men and women fall off a cliff,\" the Stanford-trained physician, who runs a medical practice in Austin, Texas, said in a recent interview with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "During the interview, Attia shared some of his top strategies for not only living longer, but also remaining strong, healthy and engaged, so the last decade is as enjoyable and independent as possible.",
      "7 STEPS TO \u2018SUPER-AGING\u2019 ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY",
      "This is what experts refer to as \"healthspan\" \u2014 the period of life when one is free from \"age-associated maladies,\" according to Douglas E. Vaughan, M.D., director of the Potocsnak Longevity Institute at Northwestern University in Chicago.",
      "\"There are certainly things that people can stop doing to extend healthspan,\" he told Fox News Digital. Some examples include stopping smoking, drinking less, maintaining a healthy weight, getting regular exercise, avoiding processed foods and having good sleep habits.",
      "Below are the five strategies that Attia shared with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "No. 1: Train like life is a sport",
      "Attia recommends approaching life \u2014 particularly in advanced age \u2014 like an athlete would approach a sport.",
      "As people age, their level of fitness, strength and mobility matters more than many traditional markers, he noted.",
      "7 COMMON FITNESS MISTAKES OLDER ADULTS MAKE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM FOR BETTER WORKOUTS",
      "The longevity expert said he logs about 10 hours per week of exercise \u2014 a mix of fat-burning cardio, high-intensity intervals (to boost VO\u2082 max), and strength training to maintain muscle.",
      "Attia said he alternates between \"zone two\" exercise, which entails steady cardio activity that allows you to maintain a conversation, and\u00a0higher-intensity \"zone four\" training.",
      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",
      "VO\u2082 max is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).",
      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can detect cancers and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.",
      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",
      "No. 4: Prioritize emotional, mental and relational health",
      "Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia went on. \"But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.\"",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia said. \"But if we're being deliberate and active about our emotional health, it can actually improve.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Vaughan echoed that the common denominator in \"super agers\" involves a supportive community, a healthy social environment and regular contact with people who care for one another.",

      "No. 5: Optimize the \u2018marginal decade\u2019",
      "While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the \"marginal decade\" as enjoyable as possible.",
      "\"The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Supreme Court justices, including President Donald Trump&apos;s appointees, expressed skepticism about his use of emergency powers to impose Liberation Day tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Legal fellow Brent Skorup says the president\u2019s use of emergency tariffs goes beyond what IEEPA allows in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case centered on President Donald Trump\u2019s use of an emergency law to enact his sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, and even Trump-appointed justices appeared skeptical of the administration\u2019s arguments.",
      "Several questions from conservative justices, particularly Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, suggested uncertainty about allowing Trump to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.",
      "The IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats, and Trump declared the trade deficit such an emergency to impose tariffs via executive order earlier this year. But the law does not mention the word \"tariffs\" or \"taxes\" \u2014 a major sticking point in both this week\u2019s oral arguments and the lower court\u2019s earlier review of the case.",
      "Most of the justices\u2019 questions focused on a single phrase in the law \u2014 the power to \"regulate importation\" during a national emergency \u2014 and whether that phrase grants Trump the authority he claims. Several justices seemed wary of a reading that could hand Congress\u2019 Article I power over revenue and taxation to the executive branch.",

      "This included Trump\u2019s appointees, who appeared to struggle with separation-of-powers issues that could vastly expand presidential authority \u2014 not only for Trump but for his successors as well.",
      "Barrett, in particular, pressed U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer on this, asking: \"Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase \u2014 together with \u2018regulate importation\u2019 \u2014 has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?\"",
      "Gorsuch later asked Sauer about his \"theory of the Constitution\" and \"major questions doctrine,\" indicating concern about separation-of-powers issues and granting too much power to the executive.",

Nov. 5, 2025. (Maxine Wallace/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "\"What would prohibit Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce or declare war to the president?\" Gorsuch asked Sauer.",
      "Sauer repeatedly argued that a \"regulatory tariff\" is not a tax and that the power to raise revenue was \"only incidental,\" even as the White House has celebrated that Trump's tariff revenues exceeded $100 billion this year.",
      "Challengers, including private entities and Democratic-led states, argue that Congress must clearly state when it wants presidents to have the authority to implement tariffs. In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA.",
      "The liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws. And under the \"major questions\" doctrine referred to by Gorsuch and other justices, large, economy-wide actions like Trump's tariffs need a plain, specific grant from Congress.",

    "summary": "Democratic Party senators were split on why they think Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy called for a 10% reduction in air traffic ahead of Thanksgiving.",
    "story": [
      "Democrat Sens. Chris Coons and Tim Kaine had opposing viewpoints when asked about the motivations behind Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's decision to reduce flights and air traffic ahead of Thanksgiving.",
      "Democratic senators on Capitol Hill offered differing responses as to why they believe Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy made the call to reduce flights and air traffic ahead of the busy Thanksgiving travel surge.",
      "After news broke that Duffy was ordering a 10% reduction in flight capacity at 40 airports across the country, Republicans remained largely unified in their messaging that any chaos caused by the forced reductions fell at the feet of Democrats.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said short of \"planes falling out of the sky,\" Democrats will not vote to reopen the government. \"Democrats are flirting with disaster,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is the chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, wrote on X in response to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, adding that there was no choice but to reduce air traffic to keep it safe.",

      "\"I don't question Secretary Duffy,\" Kaine added. \"He wants to make sure that flights are safe.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., had a much more sinister view about Duffy's motivations for compelling a reduction in air traffic ahead of the busy Thanksgiving holiday. According to Coons, the new directive is an attempt by the Trump administration to \"pressure\" Democrats to reopen the government without their demands on Obamacare being met.",
      "Coons argued that air traffic controllers and other airport personnel have been facing strains since before the shutdown due to cuts from the president's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk.",
      "\"I think it's appropriate for us to focus on improving air safety. It is more urgent for us to focus on the health care cliff that is impacting millions of Americans,\" Coons told reporters Thursday following Duffy's announcement. \"My impression is this is another attempt at putting pressure on Congress to reopen the government,\" Coons added.",

      "\"The FAA must immediately share any safety risk assessment and related data\u00a0that this decision is predicated on with Congress,\" Larsen said after news of the reduction. \"If we want to resolve issues in the National Airspace System, let us fix health care, open government and pay air traffic controllers.\"",

      "In response to the directive to reduce air traffic ahead of the holiday, U.S. Travel Association President and CEO Geoff Freeman reaffirmed his group's call for lawmakers to reopen the government or face potential \"chaos\" during the Thanksgiving surge.",
      "\"Today\u2019s announcement from Secretary Duffy and Administrator Bedford reinforces that safety is the number one priority in our nation\u2019s air travel system. The decision to reduce scheduled flight capacity, while necessary to keep our skies safe, will inevitably affect the travel experience, leading to fewer flights, longer delays and more disruptions for travelers,\" Freeman said. All government shutdowns are irresponsible and this decision underscores the urgent need to reopen the government. The shutdown is putting unnecessary strain on the system, forcing difficult operational decisions that disrupt travel and damage confidence in the U.S. air travel experience. The fault for this situation rests squarely at the feet of Congress.\"",

      "The letter, undersigned by hundreds of tourism and travel industry groups, also warned those planning to fly this Thanksgiving holiday that they could face higher costs and increased wait times, delays and cancellations that could derail family travel plans across the country, if the government shutdown doesn't end before Thanksgiving arrives.",
      "\"Last year, during Thanksgiving week, over 20 million passengers took flights in the United States. Thanksgiving is not only a time of national tradition and family connection, but also one of the most economically important travel weeks of the year,\" the letter states. \"The cost of continued inaction will be felt by families, workers, businesses, and communities in every part of the country.\""

      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The road ahead for self-driving freight looks both exciting and uncertain. The progress made by AI-powered trucks shows how far automation has come in solving real challenges like driver shortages and delivery delays. At the same time, it sparks debate about safety, employment and trust in technology. As this shift continues, clear communication and responsible testing will help the public feel more confident sharing the road with these trucks. Change is already rolling out, and how we respond today will define the future of transportation.",

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead.

      "Losing your life savings to fraud is not a distant fear; it is a real and growing risk. Scams involving criminals pretending to be bank representatives have surged, with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reporting record-breaking losses exceeding $2.9 billion in recent data. These criminals no longer rely on basic phone tricks. Instead, they use caller ID spoofing and artificial-voice software to sound like trusted professionals, often imitating real bank employees down to the smallest detail.",

      "HOW SCAMMERS EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FOR 'PRE-APPROVED' RETIREMENT SCAMS",
      "What impostor bank scams look like",
      "Scammers pretending to be from your bank follow a predictable yet terrifying pattern. They begin with an urgent phone call warning that your account has been compromised. The caller ID displays your bank's real number, which builds instant trust.",
      "Impostor scams have become one of the fastest-growing crimes in America, costing victims billions each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, they instruct you to move your money into a so-called \"safe\" or \"decoy\" account while they \"investigate\" the issue. Their goal is to create fear and push you into action before you have time to think.",
      "One journalist reportedly learned this lesson the hard way when he answered what appeared to be a legitimate call from Chase Bank. After a series of convincing conversations with multiple \"representatives,\" he transferred nearly $30,000 to scammers. In another case, a 65-year-old caterer reportedly lost $162,000 when a friendly woman pretending to be a bank employee claimed her ATM card had been compromised. These stories are not rare; they reflect how sophisticated and believable modern scams have become.",
      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",
      "Older adults are particularly vulnerable. The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024. These numbers highlight how no one is immune to manipulation when fear and urgency collide.",

      "Spoofed numbers make a call appear as if it's coming from your bank, even when it's not.",
      "Do not return calls using numbers given to you by the person who contacted you. Always call the number printed on your debit or credit card.",
      "Scammers often collect phone numbers, email addresses and other personal details from public records and data broker sites. Using a trusted data removal service helps wipe that information from the web, reducing the chances that criminals can use your data to impersonate you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

Keeping your software updated adds another layer of protection against evolving scams.",

But you can fight back with knowledge and caution. Stay alert every time your phone rings or your inbox pings. Slow down before you react. Verify before you trust. The few seconds you take to double-check could be what saves your life savings. Remember, even the most tech-savvy people fall for scams when emotions take over. The real key to protection isn't fear, it's awareness and action. Share what you know with friends, family and coworkers.

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",

      "Safeguarding your phone and personal data has never been more crucial.",
      "A new scam called ghost tapping is spreading across the country. The Better Business Bureau (BBB) warns that scammers are using this tactic to steal money from people who use tap-to-pay credit cards and mobile wallets.",
      "This scam exploits wireless technology to withdraw money without your awareness. Many victims only realize something is wrong after small, unnoticed transactions slowly drain their accounts.",

      "The Better Business Bureau warns of a new \"ghost-tapping\" scam draining money from tap-to-pay cards and mobile wallets. (Clara Margais/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "How the ghost-tapping scam works",
      "Scammers use near-field communication (NFC) devices that mimic legitimate tap-to-pay systems. In busy places such as festivals, markets, or public transportation, they move close enough to your wallet or phone to trigger a transaction.",
      "The BBB reports that some scammers pose as charity vendors or market sellers who only accept tap payments. Once you tap your card or phone, they charge far more than the agreed amount.",
      "Because the first few withdrawals are usually small, they often go undetected by fraud systems. Victims may not notice until much later, when more money has been taken.",
      "Real-life cases and warnings",
      "A Missouri resident reportedly lost $100 after being approached by a person carrying a handheld card reader. The BBB Scam Tracker has recorded many similar cases across the nation, with losses sometimes exceeding $1,000.",
      "Officials warn that scammers may pressure you to complete payments quickly, preventing you from verifying the amount or merchant name. Some even carry portable readers that can pick up signals through thin wallets or purses.",
      "How to protect yourself from ghost tapping",
      "While the threat of ghost tapping may sound alarming, protecting yourself is easier than you think. A few smart habits and security tools can greatly reduce your risk of falling victim.",
      "Invest in an RFID-blocking wallet or card sleeve to create a physical barrier between your card and potential scanners. These inexpensive tools prevent scammers from reading your card information through clothing, bags, or wallets. Look for sleeves or wallets specifically designed to block wireless communication.",
      "Always check the merchant name and transaction amount displayed on the payment terminal before tapping. Scammers often rush you to avoid scrutiny. Take an extra second to confirm what you see matches what you agreed to pay. If something looks off, cancel the transaction immediately.",
      "Enable instant transaction alerts from your bank or credit card provider. This lets you know the moment a payment is made, giving you a chance to spot unauthorized activity right away. Quick detection can prevent further charges and make it easier to dispute fraudulent transactions.",
      "Bonus protection: Even if you stop a scam early, your personal data can end up for sale online. Our No. 1 identity theft company monitors your credit and financial information, alerting you if your details appear on the dark web or in a data breach.",

      "The BBB says reports of \"ghost tapping\" are rising, with some victims losing more than $1,000 to contactless theft. (M. Scott Brauer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Crowded environments such as festivals, public transportation, or street fairs create perfect conditions for scammers to blend in. Limit tap-to-pay use in these situations. Instead, use chip or swipe methods, which require physical contact and are harder to exploit.",
      "Make it a habit to check your financial accounts at least once a week. Review each transaction carefully and report anything suspicious to your bank immediately. Even small unexplained charges could signal a larger problem.",
      "Most mobile wallet apps allow you to set PINs, facial recognition, or fingerprint verification before authorizing a transaction. Make sure these protections are enabled. This adds another barrier that prevents criminals from initiating payments without your consent.",
      "Regularly update your smartphone's software and mobile wallet apps. Updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered vulnerabilities scammers might exploit. Outdated software can leave your data exposed.",
      "Stay protected from payment-stealing malware:",
      "In addition to keeping your apps updated, protect your device from hidden threats with strong antivirus software. It scans for malicious apps and spyware that can hijack your tap-to-pay data or record sensitive information.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "While convenient, storing several cards in one app can increase your exposure if your phone is compromised. Keep only the cards you use most often connected to your mobile wallet. This reduces the impact of potential fraudulent activity.",
      "If you ever suspect ghost tapping or notice a strange charge, contact your bank immediately and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Quick action can help prevent additional losses and assist authorities in identifying scam trends.",
      "Victims of \"ghost tapping\" often lose money through small, unnoticed transactions before realizing they\u2019ve been scammed. (Leonie Asendorpf/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "As contactless payments become more common, scammers are getting more creative. Staying informed and cautious can help protect your money. Small steps like checking your transaction history and using protective gear can make a big difference. If you notice unauthorized charges, contact your bank immediately, freeze your card and report the scam to the BBB Scam Tracker. Technology offers convenience but can also create new risks. The ghost-tapping scam shows how quickly and easily payments can invite hidden dangers. Awareness and prevention remain the best ways to keep your finances safe.",

      "Why smart TVs have microphones at all",
      "Manufacturers include microphones to make TVs more interactive. You can ask for weather updates, control volume or find movies with your voice. It's convenient, but it comes with trade-offs.",
      "Some companies state in their privacy policies that voice data may be shared with third parties for analysis. That means your living room chatter could leave your home.",
      "When you disable your smart TV microphone, you keep the benefits of a modern TV while limiting unwanted data collection.",

    "published": "Sun, 02 Nov 2025 09:30:15 -0500",
    "summary": "SessionReaper vulnerability hits Magento and Adobe Commerce stores, compromising 250+ sites in one day. Hackers steal data and hijack shopping sessions.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss hackers using airport USB charging ports and phishing texts to target victims.",
      "A security researcher found a serious weakness in the software that powers thousands of e-commerce sites. The platform, called Magento, and its paid version Adobe Commerce, has a bug that lets attackers break into active shopping sessions. Some attackers can even take control of the entire store.",
      "The flaw is known as SessionReaper. It allows hackers to pretend they are real customers without needing a password. Once they are inside, they can steal data, make fake orders, or install tools that collect credit card details.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "Why is this attack so serious?",
      "The problem starts in the part of the system that handles how a store communicates with other online services. Because the software does not properly check the information it receives, it sometimes trusts data that it should not. Hackers take advantage of this by sending fake session files that the store accepts as real.",
      "Researchers at SecPod warn that successful attacks can lead to stolen customer data, fake purchases and even full control of the store's server.",
      "Once the attack method was shared publicly, cybercriminals began using it right away. Security experts at Sansec reported that more than 250 online stores were compromised within a single day. This shows how quickly attacks can spread once a vulnerability becomes public.",
      "Hackers are exploiting a new flaw called SessionReaper to hijack active shopping sessions on thousands of e-commerce sites running Adobe Commerce and Magento. (Kurt Knutsson)",
      "Why are many stores still unprotected?",
      "Adobe released a security update on Sept. 9 to fix the issue. Weeks later, about 62% of affected stores still have not installed it. Some store owners are afraid an update might break features on their site. Others simply do not know how serious the risk is.",
      "Every unpatched store remains an open door for attackers who want to steal information or install malicious code.",
      "MAJOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING GOOGLE AND DIOR, HIT BY MASSIVE SALESFORCE DATA BREACH",
      "How can you stay safe when shopping online?",
      "While store owners are responsible for fixing the problem, you can still take smart steps to protect yourself when shopping online. These actions can help you spot danger early and keep your personal information safe.",
      "Always pay attention to how a website behaves. If a page looks odd, loads slowly or shows error messages, it could mean something is wrong behind the scenes. Check for the small padlock symbol in the address bar that shows the site uses HTTPS encryption. If it is missing or the site redirects you to an unfamiliar page, stop and close the browser tab immediately. Trust your instincts if something feels off.",
      "Cybercriminals often use fake promotional emails or ads that look like real store offers. Instead of clicking links in messages or banners, type the store's web address directly into your browser to avoid phishing pages designed to steal your login details or card information. Since attacks like SessionReaper can expose your personal data to criminal marketplaces, consider using a reputable data removal service that continuously scans and deletes your private information, such as your address, phone number and email, from data broker sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft if your information has been leaked through a compromised online store.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Cybersecurity teams at SecPod and Sansec tracked more than 250 stores breached within 24 hours of the exploit going public, showing how fast these attacks spread. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Strong antivirus protection is your silent guard online. Choose reputable software that offers real-time protection, safe browsing alerts and automatic updates. A strong antivirus program can detect malicious code that tries to run on your device, block unsafe sites and alert you to potential threats. This adds another crucial layer of defense when visiting online stores that may not be fully secure.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Whenever possible, choose payment services that add an extra layer of protection between your bank account and the online store. Platforms like PayPal, Apple Pay or Google Pay do not share your card number with the retailer. This reduces the chance of your information being stolen if the store is compromised. These payment gateways also offer dispute protection if a purchase turns out to be fraudulent.",
      "Stick to stores with a solid reputation. Well-known brands usually have better security and faster response times when issues arise. Before buying from a new website, check its reviews on trusted consumer sites. Look for signs of credibility such as clear contact information, a professional design and verified payment options. A few minutes of research can save you from weeks of frustration.",
      "TRANSUNION BECOMES LATEST VICTIM IN MAJOR WAVE OF SALESFORCE-LINKED CYBERATTACKS, 4.4M AMERICANS AFFECTED",
      "Updates may seem annoying, but they are one of the most effective ways to protect your data. Make sure your computer, smartphone and web browser all have the latest security patches installed. Updates often fix the exact kinds of flaws hackers use to spread attacks like SessionReaper. Enable automatic updates if you can, so your devices stay protected without extra effort.",
      "If you create accounts on shopping sites, make sure each one has its own strong password. Avoid using the same password across multiple platforms. Consider using a password manager to generate and store long, random passwords. That way, if one account is compromised, your other logins stay safe.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "If a site or payment service offers\u00a0two-factor authentication, enable it. This adds a second security step, such as a code sent to your phone or generated by an app. Even if hackers steal your password, they will not be able to access your account without that second verification.",
      "Even weeks after Adobe issued a critical patch for the SessionReaper vulnerability, nearly two-thirds of affected online stores remain unprotected, leaving customer data and payment information at high risk of theft. (CyberGuy.com)",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks\u00a0in places like caf\u00e9s, airports and hotels are often unsecured. Avoid entering payment information or logging in to accounts while connected to public networks. If you must make a purchase while away from home, use a mobile data connection or a reliable VPN to encrypt your activity.",
      "Check your financial statements regularly for any unusual activity. Small, unauthorized charges can be early signs of fraud. Report any suspicious transactions to your bank or credit card company right away so they can freeze your account or issue a new card.",
      "If you notice anything strange during or after an online purchase, act quickly. Contact the store's customer service to report what you saw. You should also inform your payment provider or credit card company so they can block unauthorized transactions. Reporting early can help stop further damage and alert other shoppers to potential risks.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The SessionReaper attack shows how fast online threats can appear and how long they can linger when updates are ignored. Even well-known stores can become unsafe overnight. For retailers, installing patches quickly is critical. For shoppers, staying alert and choosing secure payment methods are the best ways to stay protected.",

      "\"Tariffs are a multilayered issue,\" said Dawson Hobbs, executive vice president of government affairs at the Wine and Spirits Wholesalers of America. \"The most direct one people think of is the tariffs placed on imported wine. But there are hidden aspects too, tariffs on glass, aluminum cans, labels, even glue that holds boxes together. These universal tariffs affect the entire production process and supply chain.\"",

      "\"At the beginning of the year, there were tariffs threatened, then delayed, then implemented. When products take 60 to 70 days to arrive, it\u2019s very difficult to plan when you don\u2019t know what the tariff rate will be,\" Hobbs told Fox.",

      "\"I don\u2019t wish this was the circumstance in which I was dealing with,\" he said. \"So I imagine, as we see the data change and more controllers come to work, we are as quickly as possible going to take these restrictions away.\"",

    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell, a convicted sex offender connected to Jeffrey Epstein, sent emails praising Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Texas after she was moved there in August.",
    "story": [
      "Within days of her arrival at a Texas prison camp in early August, Ghislaine Maxwell gushed in emails to her friends and family over the cleanliness and safety of her new surroundings.",
      "\u201cThe institution is run in an orderly fashion which makes for a safer more comfortable environment for all people concerned, inmates and guards alike,\u201d wrote Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting minors to be sexually abused by her longtime confidant, the wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s unexpected move to the all-women\u2019s Federal Prison Camp Bryan, which houses inmates convicted of nonviolent offenses and white-collar crimes in dormitory-style quarters, drew immediate condemnation from current and former federal Bureau of Prisons employees. They said it was very unusual for prisoners with sex offenses on their records to be incarcerated in such an unconstrained setting, indicating Maxwell was receiving preferential treatment.",
      "For more on this story, watch NBC's \"Nightly News\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT",
      "Maxwell, 63, had been in a low-security federal correctional institution in Tallahassee, Florida, following her conviction in December 2021 on federal sex trafficking charges. FCI Tallahassee is more restrictive than a camp like FPC Bryan, where inmates have access to work programs, recreation and other activities and are often serving shorter sentences. Maxwell was moved days after meeting with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in July.",
      "NBC News has reviewed emails Maxwell sent during her first few months at FPC Bryan, which were obtained by the House Judiciary Committee. The emails describe Maxwell\u2019s relief at being in a calmer facility without violence, where staff was polite and the food was better. \"My situation is improved by being at Bryan,\" she wrote in one email.",
      "\u201cThe kitchen looks clean too \u2014 no possums falling from the celling to fry unfortunately on ovens, and become mingled with the food being served,\u201d she wrote in another, complaining about her previous prison.",
      "Maxwell also praised prison camp warden Tanisha Hall, whom Maxwell called a \u201ctrue professional.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like I have dropped through Alice in Wonderlands looking glass,\u201d Maxwell wrote to a relative, adding, \u201cI am much much happier here and more importantly safe.\u201d",
      "The emails were shared with the House Judiciary Committee after the top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, wrote a letter to Hall on Oct. 30 asking about Maxwell\u2019s perceived \u201cVIP treatment.\u201d The letter cited a Wall Street Journal report last month describing special accommodations for Maxwell\u2019s visitors and other perks, such as meals sent to her dormitory room, late-night workouts and her ability to shower after other inmates were already in bed for the night.",
      "Raskin\u2019s inquiry raised other accusations made by inmates to the Journal that they have been threatened with retaliation if they speak about Maxwell to the media. At least one inmate who spoke with the Journal was transferred out of FPC Bryan after speaking about Maxwell, the newspaper reported.",
      "\u201cWhile prison officials may limit inmates\u2019 First Amendment rights to preserve security and order, you have provided no such justification for why prison security requires a \u2018Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019 gag order,\u201d Raskin wrote, asking Hall to respond to his inquiry by Nov. 13, provide documentation and coordinate a visit for his staff to speak with inmates about their experiences.",
      "The warden faces a similar inquiry and deadline from Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.",
      "The emails provided to NBC News and the House Judiciary Committee included messages from several inmates who expressed fear that they would be moved to higher-security facilities for mentioning Maxwell in phone calls or emails and said they believe she is receiving more care and attention than the typical prisoner. \u201cThey are even delivering her meals to her and NO inmates is allowed to prepare her meals,\u201d one said.",
      "Hall, who began her career as a correctional officer at FPC Bryan in 1994 and has been its warden since 2023, did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department, which oversees the BOP, declined to comment.",
      "David Oscar Markus, a lawyer for Maxwell, said in response to NBC News\u2019 request for comment about the congressional inquiries and the contents of her emails that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing journalistic about publishing a prisoner\u2019s private emails, including ones with her lawyers.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s tabloid behavior, not responsible reporting,\u201d Markus said in a statement. \u201cAnyone still interested in that kind of gossip reveals far more about themselves than about Ghislaine. It\u2019s time to get over the fact that she is in a safer facility. We should want that for everyone.\u201d",
      "Ian Maxwell, Maxwell\u2019s brother, said in an email to NBC News that messages between him and his sister are \u201cpersonal and private by their very nature.\u201d",
      "If those emails were sent to Congress and a reporter, he added, \u201cthen they were stolen and leaked without authorisation and represent a breach of intellectual property rights and the fundamental right of all citizens to privacy.\u201d",
      "Maxwell\u2019s emails indicate she\u2019s able to access the warden for help, including arranging visits and communicating with her lawyers. In an email Maxwell sent to one of her attorneys in September, she noted that she spoke with the warden when she had a problem receiving documents by a deadline in her appeal before the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cHer creative solution was that you EM/scan it to her and she will scan back my changes!\u201d Maxwell wrote, referring to her lawyer emailing the warden. \u201cOf course that is fantastic as it saves days and days.\u201d",
      "Patrick McLain, a Dallas criminal defense attorney who has represented women at FPC Bryan, said it would be unusual for any warden to get involved with inmates\u2019 cases and that \u201cno way\u201d would he expect Hall to give his clients at FPC Bryan the same personal attention as Maxwell described in the emails.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a rare occurrence,\u201d McLain said. \u201cIt would be like the head of a large corporation of a manufacturing plant regularly having contact with people on the assembly line.\u201d",
      "FPC Bryan, located in a residential neighborhood and ringed with razor wire, houses about 635 prisoners.",
      "In other emails, Maxwell, a socialite and the daughter of a British media mogul, voiced her continued frustration with the media and \u201cpeople selling rubbish stories and making money from their lies.\u201d",
      "In October, when Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was sentenced to 50 months in federal prison on two counts of transporting former girlfriends for prostitution, Maxwell was paying attention, writing in an email: \u201cWhat an intersting sentence for Diddy! Hmm.\u201d",
      "Maxwell has been a central figure in the Epstein saga that has morphed into a major and ongoing political dispute.",
      "Epstein died by suicide in a New York City jail in 2019 as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. While President Donald Trump initially said he supports full disclosure of investigative files in Epstein\u2019s case, his administration has said it would not release all of the documents, prompting outcry from Democrats, some Republicans and parts of the president\u2019s own base who have fueled conspiracy theories and pushed unfounded narratives surrounding Epstein's death.",
      "The intrigue around Epstein only grew when Blanche met with Maxwell in July for nine hours over two days in a federal courthouse in Tallahassee. The details of their discussion were not immediately made public, but in the days that followed, Maxwell was moved from her Florida prison to FPC Bryan.",
      "The Justice Department in late August released transcripts from Maxwell\u2019s meeting with Blanche, in which she said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct by Trump or any other prominent figures in Epstein\u2019s orbit. Trump, whose name appeared in the unsealed records as a friend of Epstein\u2019s before they had a falling out, has not been accused by authorities of any wrongdoing.",
      "Markus, Maxwell\u2019s attorney, has previously said that she is \u201cinnocent and never should have been tried, much less convicted, in this case.\u201d",
      "In October, the Supreme Court declined to hear Maxwell\u2019s appeal of her criminal conviction, leaving presidential clemency as her best shot at being freed before her projected 2037 release date.",
      "Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Trump told reporters that he would speak with the Justice Department and \u201cwould have to take a look\u201d at whether he would consider a pardon.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s arrival at FPC Bryan \u2014 a camp described by employees as being lax with security \u2014 led prison officials to ramp up protective measures, including patrol cars and surveillance cameras along the perimeter. Members of the BOP\u2019s Special Operations Response Team, who are highly trained on disturbances and security breaches at federal prisons, arrived to check IDs at the front entrance.",
      "A BOP official attributed the enhanced security to Maxwell\u2019s presence, but could not say whether there had been any direct threats to her, other inmates or FPC Bryan itself.",
      "Maxwell\u2019s transfer also rankled some community members, who questioned why she was selected to come to Bryan, given her conviction on a sex offense.",
      "\u201cWe want a better prison system for all, but why is she being shown privilege when there are other people who are trying and putting in the work, and they don\u2019t get to be moved here?\u201d asked Raequel Rogers, a co-organizer of the Brazos Valley Community Coalition, a grassroots group that demonstrated in front of FPC Bryan in August. \u201cIt\u2019s brought a lot of attention to our town that we haven\u2019t consented for. We don\u2019t want a child sex trafficker here.\u201d",
      "The BOP\u2019s policy indicates Maxwell should be ineligible for incarceration at a minimum-security prison camp because she is a convicted sex offender. Sex offenders must be in at least a low-security prison, as Maxwell was in Tallahassee, unless a waiver is granted by the administrator of the BOP\u2019s Designation and Sentence Computation Center.",
      "McLain, the Dallas defense attorney, said one of his clients, Julie Howell, was transferred out of FPC Bryan after she was quoted in a news article saying inmates were angry about Maxwell\u2019s placement among them. McLain said Howell was vocal because she has helped law enforcement find sex traffickers. Maxwell\u2019s arrival also disrupted the other inmates\u2019 routines, McLain said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s made their lives all topsy-turvy,\u201d he said.",
      "Howell was initially transferred from FPC Bryan to a detention center in Houston. But on Friday, McLain said, he learned Howell had finally been moved to a halfway house to complete her sentence.",
      "It was a silver lining after what happened to her in Bryan, McLain added: \u201cFortunately, the system is not totally rife with corruption.\u201d"

      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%.

      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

So I\u2019d rather change my goal and lie to myself than to fail miserably again,\u201d he says of James.",
      "After James\u2019 mom\u2019s funeral at the end of the first episode, he hijacks a car and goes on a rampage. He tries to call Ruby, and when she doesn\u2019t answer, his driving gets more and more out of control until he spins out and flips the vehicle.",

    "story": [
      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

You can also access RAINN\u2019s online chat service at https://www.rainn.org/get-help.",
      "After 26 years and 27 seasons on the air, \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d has assembled one of the most devoted audiences on television, but few have proven their loyalty to Olivia Benson and her unit the way Leighann Carroll has.",
      "Carroll, a 37-year-old Virginia middle school teacher, is in the upper echelon of the fandom and her recent viral TikTok post showed just how much the long-running procedural drama means to her.",
      "The teacher uploaded a video to the social media platform revealing a new tattoo that extends from her left knee, all the way down to her calf, until it reaches her ankle.",
      "The ink reads \u201citcjssboacehinyctddwitvfamoaeskatsvutatsdd\u201d in the typewriter-esque font Courier.",
      "Confused? Well, any \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d fan wouldn\u2019t be, as the letters correspond to the first letters of the voiceover that introduces every episode:",
      "\u201cIn the criminal justice system, sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In New York City, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Victims Unit. These are their stories.\u201d",
      "The \u201cdd\u201d at the end of the tattoo represents the show\u2019s famous \u201cdun dun\u201d sound effect.",
      "Carroll proudly displayed her tattoo in the post while the introduction played on a television in the background. The video instantly took off on TikTok and has amassed nearly 7 million views as of Nov. 6.",
      "The inspiration for the tat came across Carroll\u2019s screen a few years ago when she saw a social media post of someone who had designed a friendship bracelet with the same letters, she tells TODAY.com.",
      "She decided to turn the idea into a tattoo and specifically chose the typewriter font to match the \u201cdetective vibe\u201d of the show. She isn't the first to do so: Other \u201cLaw and Order\u201d fans have made videos displaying their similar tattoos.",
      "A personal dedication to the series had been brewing in Carroll\u2019s mind years before the bracelet appeared on her feed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been watching it since '99, literally since it aired, if I\u2019m not mistaken, Sept. 20,\u201d she says. (She\u2019s not wrong.)",
      "She recalls growing up without cable and says one of the few shows she tuned into was \u201cSVU.\u201d She and a childhood friend used to imagine themselves as Mariska Hargitay\u2019s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni\u2019s Elliot Stabler.",
      "Carroll connects with Olivia Benson and her commitment to helping victims of sexual assault.",
      "\u201cShe cared for everybody, even the episodes where it\u2019s uncomfortable and she has to work with people that are not aligned with her politically,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe writers did such a great job of including that victims matter. How you feel about a situation doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to helping others and the victims of especially sexual assault.\u201d",
      "Her other favorite character is Fin Tutuola, played by Ice-T. Carroll appreciates how much he supports his son and is an ally of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "On Oct. 13, Carroll sent a tattoo artist the letters and the idea to have them run horizontally down her leg like a sentence. Her tattoo artist was perplexed after receiving the message.",
      "\u201cWhen she asked me what the letters were, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you, but I will make a sound.\u2019 And I went, \u2018Dun, dun,\u2019\u201d Carroll says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019! She knew exactly what it was when I said it, which just goes to show how many fans there are out there.\u201d",
      "In just 10 minutes, a tribute to \u201cSVU\u201d was permanently etched into her skin. She later showed the ink to friends and family, who she says were amused. The vice principal at her school playfully rolled her eyes and shook her head when she saw it.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go places with this tattoo.\u2019 And look who I\u2019m talking to!\u201d (Her students were especially excited when the video climbed to 6.7 million views, thanks to the term \u201c67\u201d flooding TikTok.)",
      "Carroll was shocked by the response on social media, with the video reaching 1 million views in just one day. \u201cI was like, I guess I found my people,\u201d she says about the TikTok going viral. \u201cAll the comments were amazing. I was so happy to see that it was mostly positive.\u201d There were some critics, but she adds that many fans were impressed and laughed at the inside joke.",
      "Although the tattoo is a funny way to express her love for \u201cSVU,\u201d Carroll shares that she has a heavier connection to the ink and the series.",
      "\u201cI think another reason that this show really resonates with me is because one in four women has been sexually assaulted,\u201d she says, a statistic confirmed by an article published on the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website. \u201cMyself included.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a weightlifter. I\u2019m not necessarily a small person. I\u2019m 6 foot 1 and I never thought that it would happen to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cI always thought that if I was in that position, I would fight back, or I would put them in their place. And I froze. Olivia\u2019s character tells people that all the time on the show.\u201d",
      "Carroll became emotional while explaining how Olivia\u2019s repeated message that sexual assault victims are not at fault has helped her.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that people are gonna people, and all we can do is survive. Like she tells a lot of the victims on the show, the whole point was that you got out of it. You made it through to the other side. It\u2019s just an unfortunate but good connection to have with that character.\u201d",
      "She also applauds Hargitay for using her platform to speak about sexual assault, particularly the rape kit backlog.",
      "\u201cThis is real life,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cThese are real (stories). Obviously, you know the little disclaimer in the beginning, but it\u2019s still real situations. These are real events that women, especially, have to go through.\u201d"

      "After Milo is returned, Josie goes to Marissa and Peter\u2019s home with a gun in her hand. Colin tries to take the gun from Josie, and she ends up shooting him. He dies.",
      "Josie says she didn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone but warns Marissa to keep Milo safe from Peter. Why?",
      "When she tries to tell Marissa, Peter snatches the gun from Josie and shoots her. He pretends that it accidentally went off and he didn't intend to kill her.",
      "Before Josie was shot, she held up a phone with a voice recording that included Peter's secret. It turns out he was behind the baby mix up. When Josie got into the car accident, she collided with Peter, Marissa and their newborn baby.",
      "Peter believed that Marissa and Milo were dead when he called the police. He then heard Josie's son crying in the back of her car and switched the babies.",
      "\u201cOur baby died?\u201d Marissa says. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t ours, he was hers.\u201d",
      "Peter says that he thought Josie was dead and could provide the baby with a better life. He tells Marissa not to tell the cops. She doesn\u2019t.",
      "What Happened to Kyle and Rob?",
      "Josie had enlisted her father's help after she was unable to get Milo a fake passport.",
      "Seeing this as an opportunity to make some money, Rob is the one who ends up calling Peter about the ransom. When Kyle becomes connected to Carrie, his mugshot gets blasted by police and news outlets. Protecting his daughter, Rob shoots Kyle and doesn't tell Josie.",
      "Then one night, Josie finds her dad dead in their hotel room and Milo missing.",
      "When Marissa listens to the voice recording Josie told her about, Peter is heard revealing his secret about switching the babies to Rob. Marissa also hears Peter killing Rob.",
      "Marissa tells Peter she listened to the recording and he confesses to killing Rob and says he was the one to return Milo to the police station. He put Milo in the trunk of a car and made sure the boy didn\u2019t see or hear anything traumatizing.",
      "What Else Did Peter Lie to His Family About?",
      "Peter's brother Brian (Daniel Monks), who is disabled, finds out that Peter lied to him about being a candidate for a surgery that could help him walk again.",
      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",
      "Peter reveals that when they were all playing, he stuck his foot out to trip Brian. It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

      "As part of the schedule of events, contestants attended a talk from Nawat Itsaragrisil, a Thai businessman and national director of Miss Universe Thailand.",
      "While livestreaming the event on Facebook, the Miss Universe Thailand organization captured a heated exchange between Itsaragrisil and Miss Universe Mexico titleholder Fatima Bosch.",
      "What happened, and how did the Miss Universe organization respond? Here's everything we know so far.",
      "Itsaragrisil and Bosch's Argument Escalated Quickly",
      "While speaking to Miss Universe contestants, Itsaragrisil appeared  to single out Bosch for not participating in certain promotional activities for the pageant and its host country. He also criticized the national director of Mexico's Miss Universe organization.",
      "\u201cIf you follow the order from your national director, you are dumb,\u201d he said.",
      "He continued to criticize not posting about the host country and the pageant before Bosch again spoke up.",
      "Bosch, who spoke calmly throughout the interaction, seemed to upset Itsaragrisil as she attempted to share her perspective.",
      "\"Not about you,\" he said.",
      "\"I didn't give you opportunity to talk. Please keep polite. I still talking. Listen,\" he added as the exchange continued.",
      "When Itsaragrisil asked why Bosch stood up to talk while he's \"talking to everybody,\" she said, \"Because I have a voice.\"",
      "When Bosch said Itsaragrisil was \"not respecting me as a woman,\" he grew increasingly frustrated and called for security.",
      "The other women in the room were disturbed by the tense interaction and said, \"No,\" as Itsaragrisil called for security.",
      "Meanwhile, Bosch could be heard saying, \u201cI am here representing my country, and it is not my fault that you have problems with my organization.\u201d",
      "The other women in the room then got up to follow Bosch out and Itsaragrisil instructed them to \"sit down\" if they wanted to continue in the contest.",
      "Victoria Kjaer Theilvig of Denmark, who took home the title of Miss Universe in 2024, walked out with several of her fellow contestants in support of Bosch.",

      "Bosch Spoke to Reporters After the Event",
      "Outside of the event, Bosch expressed disappointment with the way she had been treated. In a video interview that was shared by the Miami Herald, she said Itsaragrisil was \"not respectful.\"",
      "\"He called me dumb because he has problems with the organization. And I think that's not fair because I'm here and I do everything OK. I don't mess with anyone. I just try to be kind. I'm trying to give my best and he just shot me and he just said to me and shut up and a lot of different things,\" she said.",

      "Bosch continued to speak passionately about why the incident was so upsetting.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the 21st century, and I\u2019m not a doll to get makeup put on and get my hair done for and have my clothes changed. I came here to be a voice for all the women and all the girls who fight for causes and to tell my country that I\u2019m completely committed to that,\u201d she said.",

Thank you to all the fans, media, and content creators who have come together to stand up for what\u2019s right. Mexico does not shut up. Mexico is rising up,\" the post read.",

      "\"I will not allow the values of respect and dignity toward women to be violated. Unfortunately, Nawat has forgotten the true meaning of what it means to be a genuine host. It means to demonstrate to all delegates of all countries that he as a host, he has the obligation to serve them, assist them and support them, and to ensure they have a unique life experience filled with kindness and courtesy so that they may enjoy and take from Thailand the best memories of their lives, in an atmosphere of healthy and friendly competition,\" he said.",

      "\u201cNawat you need to stop. Every woman in the world should be respected,\u201d he added.",
      "\"I will not allow any of them to be attacked and humiliated as many of them have managed to reach this platform of visibility and voice precisely while trying to overcome situations like these,\" he said.",

But I did talk, apologize to the rest of the girls in the room, about 75 girls in the room already.\"",
      "Itsaragrisil also expressed frustration that there hasn't been anyone with \"authority\" for Miss Universe Thailand and said he was meeting with the Miss Universe organization to discuss the situation.",
      "On Nov. 5, Itsaragrisil posted the following message to his Instagram story: \"Freedom of speech (voice) is important, but if the voice are lies it would not be call freedom of speech (voice).\""

      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility. All\u2019s Fair forgets that balance \u2014 and the result is a show that feels out of touch with the moment we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

But a day before fans expected to see Grande, Cynthia Erivo and more cast members posing on the red carpet, the 32-year-old singer and actor announced on her Instagram story that she won\u2019t be able to attend the premiere due to a plane issue.",
      "\u201cBrazil, i can\u2019t believe this is happening and i am beyond devastated to be sending this message. a few hours ago, my team and i had to deplane our flight as they had to do maintenance on the plane due to a safety issue and it will not be taking off until 11am tomorrow which means that i would not be making it in time for the Wicked For Good S\u00e3o Paulo premiere,\u201d she began in a lengthy statement posted Nov. 3. \u201cMy team and Universal have tried every single thing possible to fix this, we\u2019ve searched every other flight, overnight, early morning, connecting flights, commercial and also private options and absolutely nothing was available or possible that would get us there in time.\u201d",

      "But it seems that some fans were not satisfied with Grande\u2019s explanation and apology. Hours before the S\u00e3o Paulo event, Grande returned to the social media platform to share another statement in which she encouraged fans to be more understanding.",
      "\u201cPlease don\u2019t wish danger on us. we did everything we could and i promise you no one is more upset than i am, i promise,\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted message on her Instagram story Nov. 4 and included a heart. \u201cNo matter how upset or disappointed you are, please please do not wish danger on us or assume that we didn\u2019t try \u2026 there was no other time for me to leave and these plans have been booked for months.\u201d",
      "She shared that she has had a busy schedule recently, balancing finishing another film and working \u201call day\u201d the past two days. Grande also added that she was scheduled to fly to Brazil the same day as co-stars Erivo and Jonathan Bailey, as well as director Jon M. Chu, but her flight issues altered their plans.",
      "\u201cSo please know how disappointed i am \u2026 sending lots of love to you all,\u201d she concluded. \u201cI hope it\u2019s a beautiful and safe night. i love Brazil, i always have, i always will.\u201d",

      "The other film Grande was referring to in her post was the upcoming sequel \u201cFocker-In-Law.\u201d She announced on Instagram Oct. 31 that she had wrapped filming for the flick, out next November. \u201cThese past few months have been so, so unimaginably special. i love my Fockers, and i love my Byrnes\u2026 so, so very much \u2661 i will miss this bunch terribly,\u201d she captioned a series of photos that showed her with a few cast members, including Ben Stiller."

    "story": [
      "NEW DELHI \u2014 When the weight loss drug Mounjaro came on the market in India earlier this year, Shyamanthak Kiran was one of the first patients to try it.",
      "Kiran, a 27-year-old financial trader who has struggled with hypothyroidism, said he \u201cdid not have a lot of expectations\u201d when it came to losing weight. But \u201cluck turned out in my favor,\u201d he said, and in six months he lost all of the 60-plus pounds he had gained a few years earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was a two-year struggle that came to an end, and I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro, which is also used to treat diabetes in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
      "The injectable medication from American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has become India\u2019s most popular drug by value since being approved in March, with over $11 million in sales in October, pharmaceutical market research firm Pharmarack said Friday.",
      "Even before India\u2019s more recent approval of Ozempic, another drug that is widely used for weight loss in the United States and other countries, there was already surging demand in the country for semaglutide, its active ingredient.",
      "Ozempic\u2019s Danish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, says it is \u201cactively working\u201d to widen the availability of the drug, which Indian regulators have approved for diabetes but not obesity. The company also makes other semaglutide drugs that are already used for weight loss in India, including Wegovy, an injectable, and Rybelsus, which is taken orally.",
      "Demand could grow even further when the patent for Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, expires next March in India, a pharmaceutical manufacturing giant where companies are eager to produce cheaper generic versions of the lucrative weight-loss drugs.",
      "The exploding popularity of the drugs has taken aback some doctors and officials, with Jitendra Singh, a government minister and physician, warning in August against the \u201cunchecked spread of disinformation\u201d through \u201cfad regimens\u201d and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions such as regular yoga practice.",
      "Semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, are GLP-1 agonists that were first developed to treat diabetes and have also been approved in many countries for the treatment of obesity. They regulate blood sugar and help slow how quickly food passes through the stomach, curbing hunger as a result.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has over 100 million people with diabetes, or nearly 10% of its adult population, according to a 2023 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research. An additional 135 million people are prediabetic, the study found.",
      "Doctors say the situation is worsening as India\u2019s burgeoning middle class adopts a more Western lifestyle, eating more high-fat, high-sugar foods and exercising less.",
      "\u201cCompared to, say, a decade ago, there are more people now in their late 20s and early 30s who are being diagnosed with diabetes, as compared to the elderly population,\u201d said Dr. Saurav Shishir Agrawal, an endocrinologist in Noida, which is part of Delhi\u2019s capital region.",
      "\u201cThey ask us to just give them pills,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut these medicines work better only when you are clubbing them with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "Agrawal practices at the newly built Medanta Hospital, where staff greet patients with a gentle \u201cNamaste.\u201d It is an example of the growing number of modern and high-end hospitals popping up around increasingly dense megacities such as Delhi, home to 33 million people, where diabetes has a greater hold.",
      "A monthly course of Mounjaro can cost as much as $250, the average monthly salary in many parts of India. But for more affluent Indians, a bigger deterrent is the idea of injecting themselves, said Dr. Tribhuvan Gulati, an endocrinologist.",
      "\u201cPeople get scared whenever you tell them that they\u2019re going to be on an injectable,\u201d said Gulati, who has a clinic in central Delhi.",
      "Gulati keeps a demo pen of Mounjaro in a drawer to show how easy it is to use the medicine, which just needs to be refrigerated before use.",
      "But the ease of use is also what worries Gulati and other doctors, who say many patients fail to overhaul the lifestyle and dietary habits causing or contributing to their health issues in the first place.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the causes of obesity in India, it is 90% lifestyle and 10% anything else,\u201d said Dr. Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol and head of India\u2019s National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe diet now is totally imbalanced because of free availability of food everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "The potential gastrointestinal and other side effects from the weight-loss drugs, which in the U.S. have prompted multiple lawsuits against GLP-1 makers, give some patients pause, Gulati said. But others \u201care OK with continuing it throughout their life because they know that they won\u2019t be able to control themselves.\u201d",
      "Diabetic patients such as Moinak Pal, who has high insulin resistance, say that GLP-1 drugs have been the easiest way to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI have been fat-shamed since I was a child,\u201d said Pal, 34, a Noida-based journalist. He said he has been losing about 3 pounds a week since he started taking Mounjaro.",
      "It was \u201cextremely difficult for me to lose weight by conventional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the problem, Misra said, is the lifestyle in India\u2019s sprawling and congested urban areas, where commutes can last as long as four hours round-trip. When workers get home, apps can deliver everything from food to clothes to their doorsteps in minutes.",
      "\u201cThey want quick fixes that don\u2019t involve going on a restrictive diet or daily exercise of an hour and so on,\u201d he said of some of his patients. \u201cAs a result, diabetes is everywhere. Every day I see patients who are young, who have uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Rajendra Nath Dixit blames nobody but himself for his health problems. The retired banker had heart bypass surgery earlier this year, and before that had been spending almost 8,000 rupees ($90) a month just on his insulin.",
      "\u201cI was fond of taking the typical Indian oily foods, samosas, chole bhature, and in the evening I would take five or six rotis,\u201d said Dixit, 66. \u201cEvery bad habit was there.\u201d",
      "In the five months since his surgery, Dixit has switched over completely to the oral semaglutide Rybelsus, is exercising more and is consuming less fat and sugar. He is spending 11,000 rupees ($125) a month on Rybelsus, but has been able to stop using insulin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling very good, very light,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence has gone up, and my life has totally changed.\u201d"

American culture in general no longer offered white people the same opportunities as other races, they said.",
      "The couple yearned to live in a place that shared their \"Christian values\" and where they \"weren't going to be discriminated against\" as white, politically-conservative Christians.",
      "So in March, the Huffmans became the first family to move to a community planned for fellow English-speakers some 30 miles west of Moscow, a project they had been following online run by long-term American expat and former Kremlin-sponsored RT host Tim Kirby. The family is among a small but growing number of Americans who have moved to Russia because the United States, in their opinion, has become too \u201cwoke.\"",
      "The Russian government has welcomed these culture war refugees. In 2024, President Vladimir Putin issued an executive order offering temporary residence to people wanting to move to the country because they rejected \"destructive neoliberal ideological attitudes\" of their home countries.",
      "Around 1,500 of these \u201cideological immigrants,\u201d as they\u2019ve been dubbed by the Russian media, including 127 Americans, have applied for temporary residence in Russia, according to the Main Directorate for Migration Affairs.",
      "\"President Putin is an amazing leader and he\u2019s done great things for Russia,\u201d Derek Huffman, 45, said in a video on his family\u2019s YouTube channel on March 9. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like you see on the news.\u201d The social media platform X \u201cis the only place where you get real information\" about America's own problems, Derek says.",
      "The family initially found a community of Russians and westerners on social media who encouraged their move, with donations from some of their 15,000 YouTube subscribers providing financial support after their arrival in Russia. But when Derek Huffman voluntarily joined the Russian army in May, the family became a lightning rod for broader online scrutiny.",
      "Derek Huffman said he joined the Russian army to expedite the family\u2019s applications for Russian citizenship, as well as to show support for their new homeland.",
      "\u201cAbove and beyond the citizenship, the money, a big part of it for me is about the respect and earning our place here in Russia,\u201d he said on the Huffmans\u2019 YouTube channel on May 26.",
      "But in a follow-up video posted in June, which was subsequently deleted, DeAnna Huffman, 42, told viewers that her husband had been \u201cthrown to the wolves.\u201d NBC News viewed a re-upload of the video.",
      "The couple had hoped Derek Huffman would put previous welding experience to use in the repair battalion and \u201cactually be utilized for his skills,\u201d she said in the video. Instead, she said, he was sent to the front line and struggled to understand his training, which was in Russian.",
      "Pro-Ukrainian commentators, keen to publicize hardship for pro-Russian figures, said on social media that Derek Huffman had been killed. A post on X claiming to have access to drone footage of his death has more than 2 million views. NBC News did not find video to substantiate the claim, and DeAnna Huffman denied the reports.",
      "Derek reappeared in several videos on the family\u2019s YouTube channel uploaded on October 25, celebrating his daughter\u2019s birthday and signing forms to receive his Russian passport.",
      "In one filmed in the family\u2019s neighborhood, he said he was back \u201con vacation\u201d after being deployed for six months, and praised his wife for keeping the family going while he was gone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that I\u2019m still alive and doing what I can to survive, and be of service to Russia. I\u2019m so thankful to all the Russian people who have reached out and helped my family while I\u2019ve been gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Another family, the Hares, also moved from Abilene, Texas, to Russia to shield their three sons from what they say are harmful elements of American culture.",
      "\u201cIt was the promise of a country that would not promote the LGBT agenda. We liked the fact that LGBT is basically outlawed here in official ways,\u201d Leo Hare, 62, told NBC News via a video call from the family\u2019s new home in Ivanovo, Russia.",
      "Russia has strict laws against the \u201cpromotion of nontraditional sexual relationships,\u201d which have in practice banned public displays of LGBTQ identity, including wearing or posting the rainbow flag on social media.",
      "His wife Chantelle Hare, 53, says in a video on the family's own YouTube channel that when they lived the U.S., she and her husband preferred to get their news from Alex Jones and Mike Adams, who are far-right commentators and conspiracy theorists. They felt particularly disillusioned with American politics after the 2020 election, and don\u2019t believe Donald Trump\u2019s return to power will change the country enough to convince them to return.",
      "\u201cWhen we left, it was final. We don\u2019t plan to come back. There will not be anything to come back to,\u201d Chantelle Hare said.",
      "The Hares have endured their share of hardship trying to build a new life in Russia.",
      "They say their initial plan to rent an apartment in Moscow fell through just as they boarded the plane from Texas, and the family spent a bitterly cold winter caring for chickens, horses and rabbits on a farm 70 miles south of Moscow in exchange for free board. At one point, they even had to bring the goats and their newborns inside their cabin to keep the animals from dying.",
      "Leo Hare thought their troubles were over when their landlord\u2019s son offered a generous interest rate for investing their $50,000 nest egg in what he described as a car import business. But they only saw one payment before he stopped sending them money and refused to return their money, Leo Hare said.",
      "The couple went to the police and the local court to file complaints about their lost money and with their concerns that they had been swindled, but say they have received no help from law enforcement officials. NBC News contacted Domodedovo police for comment but did not receive a reply.",
      "The Hares\u2019 sons, 17, 15, and 12, have had difficulty adapting to life in Russia, and the two older boys want to return to America, according to their father. They feel isolated and are disappointed that school is not an option since Russia requires students to pass a language test to study in public schools.",
      "Leo and Chantelle, who ran a carpet cleaning business and a mobile snack business back in the U.S., are now working as English tutors. They have found an apartment in Ivanovo, northeast of Moscow, and \u201care living really comfortably now.\u201d They are currently homeschooling their children. Leo Hare said it probably \u201cwould have been a dealbreaker\u201d if they knew about the school restrictions.",
      "The Hares have not met the Huffmans.",
      "Leo Hare says he never considered joining the army because of his age and safety concerns, and says that Derek Huffman \u201cassumed a little too much\u201d about life in the Russian military.",
      "\"We assumed a lot, too,\" he admitted. \"But we do have a faith in Christ and He is leading us, even though we\u2019ve made mistakes.\""

      "LONDON \u2014 It\u2019s been a strange sort of prison break: no daring escapes, no Hollywood getaways \u2014 just inmates quietly released, by mistake, onto the streets of Britain.",
      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

      "Hours after the announcement, a State Department spokesperson indicated the U.S. was still working to get both sides \u2014 the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese military \u2014 to agree a truce.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage directly with the RSF and SAF to facilitate a humanitarian truce,\" the spokesperson said, referring to the Sudanese Armed Forces. \"We urge both sides to move forward in response to the U.S.-led effort to conclude a humanitarian truce.\"",

      "\u201cFeed, supplements, experienced staff, compound and grounds maintenance, vets, and more all exert pressure on our purse,\u201d it says."

      "Putin's forces have been battling to take Pokrovsk for more than a year, but now appear on the verge of a breakthrough with the front lines in the city increasingly blurred.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Wednesday that Ukrainian troops should surrender to save themselves, claiming they were \"trapped\" by Russian forces in the city, which was once home to some 60,000 people but is now largely deserted and destroyed.",
      "It said that Russian troops were advancing further northward into Pokrovsk, blocking multiple Ukrainian attempts to break out of encirclement.",

      "\u201cAs of now there is no permanent line of defense as such,\u201d she said. \u201cThe enemy seeps northwards by one, two, three units at a time, thereby trying to erode the frontline,\u201d Kononchuk added.",
      "Her comments match the assessment of the Ukrainian open-source mapping project Deep State. Its latest map showed that Russian forces had pushed further into the city from the south but that most of the area remained a contested gray zone controlled by neither side.",
      "Ukraine has deployed additional resources in a bid to hold back the Russian assault, including a special forces operation using U.S.-made Black Hawk helicopters to restore supply routes, according to a spokesperson for the 7th Rapid Response Corps that is leading the defensive effort.",
      "Kononchuk hopes that these reinforcements will stabilize the situation. \u201cThe logistics situation is now very complicated. Rotating positions is hard, and evacuating the wounded is even harder,\u201d she said.",
      "The Ukrainian commander overseeing defense of the city, Col. Yevhen Lasiichuk, said via WhatsApp on Monday that Moscow\u2019s claims of an encirclement were false and part of Russia\u2019s propaganda \u201cgame.\u201d",

      "Lasiichuk stressed that, although complicated, Ukraine was still able to reach its troops in Pokrovsk.",
      "\u201cOur Defense Forces units have recently carried out airborne landings,\u201d he said. \u201cThis certainly does not look like an encirclement.\u201d",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday that its troops had repelled a Ukrainian special forces landing and killed all 11 soldiers who arrived by helicopter.",
      "Influential Russian military bloggers have reported the heavy use of drones and smaller mobile units to disrupt Ukrainian defenses.",
      "While the exact situation on the ground remained unclear, military analysts said that losing Pokrovsk would be a bitter blow for Ukraine as it pushes for greater U.S. support.",
      "\"The loss of Pokrovsk would make Ukrainian logistics on this front complicated, increase the risk of losing or retreating from nearby positions, and require a restructuring of the defensive lines,\" Viktor Kevliuk, a retired Ukrainian colonel now working for the Kyiv-based Center for Defense Strategies, said in an interview.",
      "Pokrovsk would be Russia\u2019s most important territorial gain since it took the eastern city of Avdiivka in early 2024. Its capture could cause a \u201cdomino effect,\u201d but would still be a limited strategic gain unlikely to shift the overall balance of the war, Kevliuk said.",
      "Other experts said it could bolster Putin's bargaining hand after Trump called off a planned summit and imposed new sanctions on Russia last month.",

      "Armed with bear spray and shields, troops from the country's Self Defense Force will help carry and set steel-barred box traps to capture the bears, transport local hunters who then shoot them and help dispose of the bodies.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 International markets plunged Wednesday as stocks across the Asia-Pacific region sold off on worries about the sky-high valuations of artificial intelligence and tech companies.",
      "The Kospi stock index in South Korea plunged more than 6% at its lowest point. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 average slid about 4.5%, and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index tumbled more than 1%. Stocks in Taiwan also fell around 2.5%.",
      "European markets also opened lower.",
      "The pan-European STOXX 600 dropped as much as 0.7%, while Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 was down 0.2% at its lowest, and Germany\u2019s benchmark stock index took a hit of 0.7%. The markets clawed back some of their losses later.",
      "U.S. stock futures, an indication of where markets will open, showed that losses were likely to continue Wednesday after the opening bell rings in New York. S&P 500 futures pointed to a drop of 0.5%, and Nasdaq futures indicated a decline of about 1% on Wednesday.",
      "While Asian markets pared some of their losses from earlier in the day, the indices closed lower across the board, which economists said was an indicator of how reliant tech companies, even in Asia, are on the U.S.",
      "\u201cThere are some Asian economies \u2014 Taiwan the most, followed by South Korea \u2014 that are really dependent on U.S. tech companies,\u201d said Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about the export of chips and more generally the ecosystem,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very correlated.\u201d",
      "The selloff came after a day of significant selling in the United States that brought the recent global market rally to a halt. The S&P 500 closed Tuesday down 1.1%, the Nasdaq tumbled 2%, and the Russell 2000 fell 1.8%.",
      "The largest publicly traded company in the world, Nvidia, dropped nearly 4% on Tuesday. Palantir, another AI firm whose business involves government contracts, sank nearly 8% even after it beat Wall Street\u2019s earnings expectations.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the graph for the whole index and how much that index has been contributed by AI stocks, you just can\u2019t believe that\u2019s sustainable,\u201d Garc\u00eda-Herrero said.",
      "Last week, the Kospi hit a record high, fueled by gains in AI stocks. Taiwan\u2019s benchmark index, TWI, has gained 20% this year, driven in part by the 40% gain seen by TSMC, which supplies chips to Nvidia and other tech companies.",
      "But on Wednesday, the months-long rally came to a grinding halt after overvaluation warnings from Wall Street, resulting in a steep selloff, with shares of global electronics giant Samsung falling 5.5% and chipmaker SK Hynix dropping more than 6%.",
      "SoftBank, a major investor in AI firms, sank more than 14%, wiping out more than $30 billion in market value.",
      "Late Monday, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley warned that a possible market pullback may be on the horizon. Matters were made worse by lackluster earnings Tuesday afternoon from Advanced Micro Devices and Super Micro Computer, both of which manufacture chips used for AI services.",
      "Enthusiasm about artificial intelligence and the companies that produce AI services has been overflowing for months. Companies from Amazon to Microsoft to OpenAI have announced a steady stream of multibillion-dollar deals with one another, raising questions over the sustainability of the industry and its sources of funding.",
      "U.S. stocks are coming off a remarkable run, repeatedly setting recent record highs. For the year so far, the S&P 500 is still up more than 15%. The Nasdaq Composite, which more closely tracks the largest tech companies, has still gained more than 20% this year.",
