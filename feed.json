      "When he was 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France",
      "AMSTERDAM -- When he was just 17 years old, German artist Anselm Kiefer retraced the footsteps of Vincent van Gogh from the Netherlands through Belgium and into France.",
      "Now, more than half a century later, the museum named for the Dutch master is joining forces for the first time with the neighboring Stedelijk modern and contemporary art museum in Amsterdam to stage a blockbuster exhibition of Kiefer's work, titled \u201cSag mir wo die Blumen sind,\u201d a reference to folk singer Pete Seeger's iconic pacifist anthem \u201cWhere have all the flowers gone?\u201d",
      "Kiefer said he did not set out to make an exclusively anti-war exhibition, even though he closely follows world events including the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t say \u2018I do now an exhibition against the war.\u2019 This I don\u2019t do because this is a program; I\u2019m not a programmatic artist,\" he said. \"I do what is in me, what has to come out. And that is about all kinds of things, about the dead, about the war.\u201d",
      "Kiefer's sometimes bleak work, rooted in growing up in post-World War II Germany, might not immediately feel closely related to Van Gogh's vibrant and richly colored landscapes and vases of sunflowers.",
      "But take a look at Kiefer's 2019 \u201cThe Crows,\u201d alongside Van Gogh's 1890 \u201cWheatfield with Crows,\u201d and the inspiration for the German's work jumps from the wall.",
      "The brooding black birds aren't the only shared subjects that the two artists depict.",
      "One of Van Gogh's most famous inspirations \u2014 sunflowers \u2014 also appear in Kiefer's works.",
      "A huge dried sunflower hangs upside down in a glass cabinet, shedding its seeds on a book made from lead sheets, while \u201cSol Invictus\u201d shows a sunflower towering over the artist, who is lying in a yoga position known as the corpse pose.",
      "The show also includes some of his sketches from his trip retracing Van Gogh's footsteps.",
      "The 79-year-old German artist has a long relationship not just with Van Gogh, but also with the Stedelijk and Dutch collectors who bought some of his early works. The Stedelijk is showing early pieces such as a sculpture of an aeroplane resembling a B-1 bomber that is made of lead and called \u201cJourney to the end of the Night.\u201d",
      "The centerpiece of the Stedelijk is the installation for which the show is named. Built up around the museum's central staircase, it features paint-splattered clothes on hangers and flower petals spilling down paintings and into piles on the floor, among many things.",
      "Kiefer said that he wrote one of the lines in the Seeger song, which was later also sung in German by Marlene Dietrich, on the wall as part of the installation: \u201cWho will ever learn?\u201d",
      "\"This sentence makes the song philosophical,\" he told reporters. \"You know, because we cannot understand. We cannot understand, for example, that today things happened in (19)33 in the world.\u201d",
      "Asked about the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party that surged in last month's German election, he said: \u201cIt's horrible.\u201d",
      "The huge central work is made up of a long list of components including emulsion, oil, acrylic, shellac, golf leaf, sediment of electrolysis, dried flowers, straw, fabric and steel.",
      "The straw features in many of Kiefer\u2019s paintings, giving them a complex surface that sometimes echoes Van Gogh\u2019s bold brush strokes.",
      "\"He\u2019s working like a sort of ... alchemist transforming material into an art,\u201d curator Edwin Bakker of the Van Gogh Museum told The Associated Press.",
      "The exhibition opens March 7 and runs until June 9 at the Van Gogh Museum and Stedelijk Museum."

      "LOS ANGELES -- Actor Steve Carell is sending Southern California high school students affected by the devastating wildfires in Los Angeles to the prom for free.",
      "The \u201cOffice\u201d actor and comedian said Tuesday in an Instagram video that he was working with the Alice's Kids charity to pay for prom for seniors at six high schools in Pasadena.",
      "\u201cIf you have already paid for your prom tickets, they will reimburse you for your prom tickets. It\u2019s a pretty good deal,\u201d Carell said.",
      "The Los Angeles area fires destroyed more than 16,000 homes, businesses and other structures and killed at least 29 people in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood and Altadena area north of Pasadena. It also scorched school campuses, upending the lives of thousands of students and parents who were left scrambling looking for classrooms for their kids to go to.",
      "Alice's Kids will donate about $175,000 for more than 800 students to attend the annual right-of-passage dance for graduating students. Tickets typically range from $100 to $150 each.",
      "\u201cGoing to prom should be a celebration, and we wanted to help make the big night just a little easier for seniors whose lives have been turned upside down by the wildfires,\u201d Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of Alice\u2019s Kids, said in a statement. \u201cHopefully this allows the students to unwind and have some fun after a devasting year.\u201d",
      "An Instagram video posted by John Muir High School, one of the recipient schools, show students clapping and cheering as they were surprised with Carell's announcement during a school assembly.",
      "Another recipient includes Aveson Charter School, whose campus for kindergarten through 5th grade students burned down in the fires and building for sixth through 12th graders is damaged and unusable.",
      "Carell also participated in the star-studded \u201cSkate for LA Strong\u201d hockey tournament last week to raise money for fire relief.",
      "In closing, the actor said: \u201cHave fun, enjoy the prom. And remember, this is Steve Carell.\u201d"

      "PARIS -- Doja Cat took her front-row seat at Balmain\u2019s fall show at Paris Fashion Week, fresh off her appearance at the Oscars in a custom beaded Balmain gown. But on the runway, designer Olivier Rousteing shifted from red carpet opulence to a new kind of luxury, built on sculptural knitwear, fluid draping and dazzling blown-up zebra motifs.",
      "The Wednesday night collection opened with a now-familiar silhouette from Rousteing \u2014 a swooping hooded sweater, this time paired with a leather peplum and relaxed leather trousers. Knitwear remained the focus \u2014 draped mohair, wool jersey dresses and cocooning sweaters gave the collection a sense of ease.",
      "The monochrome \u201cgroutfit\u201d made a strong showing, broken up by the rich textural play of pleats, ruched tops and embossed leathers that kept the palette from falling flat.",
      "That softness found its counterbalance in statement hardware and a flash of animalistic energy. Chunky bracelets, talon earrings and that bold, graphic zebra motif, paired with oversized coats and slouchy boots reminded us this was still Balmain.",
      "The footwear was a standout. Sculpturally twisted pumps and fuzzy or buttery-soft leather boots injected a playful contrast into the collection\u2019s rhythm of black, white and bursts of citrus orange.",
      "Though the emphasis on draping and ease was a shift, the Balmain DNA shone through in the accessories. Rousteing\u2019s experiment with volume felt like a recalibration rather than a reinvention, proving once again that luxury isn\u2019t just about excess, but knowing when to let the clothes breathe."

      "PARIS -- The trial of seven people charged in connection with alleged cyberbullying targeting the artistic director of last summer\u2019s Paris Olympics\u2019 opening and closing ceremonies has started in a Paris court.",
      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "The architect \u201cupholds the transcendent power of the built environment through the harmonizing of cultural, historical, emotional and social dimensions, using architecture to forge community, inspire compassion and elevate the human spirit,\u201d Pritzker organizers said in a statement.",
      "Liu is known for creating public areas in highly populated cities where there is little public space, \u201cforging a positive relationship between density and open space,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Organizers cited his West Village in Chengdu, a 2015 five-story project that spans a block. It includes a perimeter of pathways for cyclists and pedestrians around \u201cits own vibrant city of cultural, athletic, recreational, office and business activities within, while allowing the public to view through to the surrounding natural and built environments.\u201d",
      "They also noted the Sichuan Fine Arts Institute Department of Sculpture in Chongqing, which they said displays an alternate solution to maximizing space, \u201cwith upper levels protruding outward to extend the square footage of a narrow footprint.\u201d",

      "Liu said he also seeks to balance commercial imperatives with civic concerns.",
      "\u201cThe rapid development of cities nowadays is basically driven by capital. It is natural for capital to pursue profits,\u201d he said. But he added: \u201cYou have to leave the public the space they deserve.

But will it also make me better at work? Not necessarily. Excessive expectations may become a pressure.\u201d",
      "He had another concern, too.",
      "\u201cAnd will it make me too busy and prevent me from working more attentively?\u201d he pondered. \u201cI hope to keep the normalcy and the freedom, as well as calmness.\u201d",

      "George Clooney, the proud son of a journalist, likes journalism and telling truth to power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 George Clooney made waves in July when he called on Joe Biden to drop out of the presidential race, citing diminished capacity. For Clooney, there wasn't a choice to stay silent.",
      "\u201cI was raised to tell the truth and telling the truth means telling it when it's not comfortable,\" the actor-director and big Democratic booster tells The Associated Press. \u201cI did what I was raised and taught to do. That\u2019s it.\u201d",
      "There was inevitable backlash \u2014 just as there was back when he was branded a traitor for speaking out against the invasion of Iraq \u2014 but Clooney took the hits.",
      "\u201cTelling the truth to power or taking chances like that \u2014we\u2019ve seen it over our history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here and survived these things and we will survive it.\u201d",
      "Clooney's truth-to-power stance takes another step this spring as he makes his Broadway debut, telling the story of legendary reporter Edward R. Murrow in an adaptation of his 2005 film \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d Performances starts March 12.",
      "Murrow, who died in 1965, is considered one of the architects of U.S. broadcast news and perhaps his greatest moment was opposing Sen. Joe McCarthy, who cynically created paranoia of a communist threat in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThis is a story about who we are at our best, when we hold our own feet to the fire, when we check and balance ourselves,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cWhat\u2019s scary about now and the difference between Murrow\u2019s time is that we\u2019ve now decided that truth is negotiable.\u201d",
      "In the movie version \u2014 which Clooney co-wrote with Grant Heslov \u2014 the role of Murrow went to David Strathairn and Clooney played CBS executive Fred Friendly; this time, Clooney takes up the mantle of Murrow. When he and Heslov did a reading for theater investors he just played Murrow and the financiers agreed to sink their money in the play \u2014 on the condition Clooney stay in the role.",
      "As in the movie, the play version will have footage of the real McCarthy on screens and the stage will resemble a newsroom with several dozen old-fashioned monitors mixing old and new footage.",
      "The transition to Broadway makes a lot of sense since many of the movie's reviewers said it felt to them a lot like a play. It actually was originally conceived as a live TV movie, an idea scuttled after Justin Timberlake exposed Janet Jackson's nipple in the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show and scared away any notion of live network events.",
      "\u201cIt is an incredibly literary play,\u201d says Tony-winning director David Cromer. \u201cIt is filled with debate. It is filled with well-reasoned and very complex arguments about is this the right thing to do? Is this the right thing to do now? What happens when we do this? How do we say this?\u201d",
      "Two-time Oscar winner Clooney returns to Murrow at a time when journalists are under fire from the new U.S. administration and being denied access for not following White House talking points.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t decide to remount or do the play for any real political reasons,\u201d says Heslov, a frequent Clooney collaborator who is also making his Broadway writing debut. \u201cIt turns out that the environment might be ripe for it.\u201d",
      "Murrow had a large presence in Clooney\u2019s home growing up. His father, Nick Clooney, a veteran journalist, worked as a TV news anchor and host in a variety of cities including Cincinnati, Salt Lake City and Los Angeles. He also wrote a newspaper column in Cincinnati and taught journalism at American University.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m the son of a journalist, a proper journalist, a guy who tells the truth. My father\u2019s still out there fighting the good fight,\u201d says Clooney. \u201cI believe in it. I believe in the whole idea of how this works.\u201d",
      "Clooney is part of a starry group of Hollywood veterans arriving on Broadway this season, a list that includes Denzel Washington, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keanu Reeves, Robert Downey Jr., Jim Parsons, Sarah Snook and John Mulaney.",
      "Clooney insisted before he came that he didn't want to be the highest paid actor on Broadway. It mirrored the time he mortgaged his house and paid himself a salary of just $1 to finance the movie version of \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s like, pay Patti LuPone the most of anybody on Broadway. Pay somebody who\u2019s paid their dues. It shouldn\u2019t be somebody who\u2019s doing his first Broadway play,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be part of that. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d",
      "The box office for a ticket to see him at the Winter Garden is white hot even before previews begin but Clooney deflects that to Murrow \u2014 it's not me, he suggests, it's the character he's playing.",
      "\u201cThe words of Edward Murrow are words that kind of soothe us,\" he says. \"It\u2019s a salve for insanity. And I think people are excited to be in a room and share some of those conversations.\u201d",
      "Clooney hasn't done a full-length play since he got his Equity Card in 1986 in Chicago as the comic relief in \u201cVicious,\u201d about punk icon Sid Vicious. \u201cMost of the cast members that I\u2019m working with weren\u2019t born when I did my last play. So it\u2019s scary,\u201d he says.",
      "He thought he'd missed his chance at Broadway, a notch on many actor's bucket list. He's 63 now and it would mean uprooting his family for months.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve succeeded in my career. I\u2019m not saying that I haven\u2019t succeeded, but I hadn\u2019t done anything on Broadway and I thought maybe it\u2019s too late,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been offered a couple of plays that I didn\u2019t think I was right for, and I thought if I was going to do it, I should do something that I was right for. And this was an opportunity where I thought, \u2018Well, I know how to tell this story. I may not do a great job with it. You know, I may really screw it up, but I know what\u2019s required of the thing.\u2019\u201d"

      "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- At the Oscars ceremony, they were there. At the after-parties, they were barely there.",
      "Celebrities bared a lot more than their emotions on Oscar night. The naked fashion trend was on full display at places like the Vanity Fair party carpet, where guests clearly bought into the idea that less is more.",
      "Among them: actor-director Olivia Wilde, who wore a sheer, embroidered lace negligee by Chlo\u00e9, \u201cwith metal ends and embroidered lace lingerie panties,\u201d according to the designer.",
      "While Wilde's outfit had a demure bohemian charm, actor Julia Fox leaned much further toward naked, arriving in a see-through wrap dress where the only adornment seemed to be strategically placed hair extensions.",
      "Doja Cat sang \u201cDiamonds Are Forever\u201d on the telecast during a James Bond tribute segment in what looked like only diamonds, with little fabric in between. Then she showed up at the Vanity Fair party in a custom Balmain strapless gown with fringes, which the designer said \u201cwas crafted by 39 artisans over the course of 3,450 hours.\u201d The inspiration: an Oscar statue reflecting the female form \u2014 and that form was celebrated, beneath all the hand-threaded glass beads in nine different shades of gold.",
      "Kendall Jenner drew attention at the Vanity Fair fete with a vintage 1992 Mugler number in black lace that was actually made of rubber. \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d actor Leslie Bibb decided to go with the popular nude-sparkle look.",
      "Although the trend may feel somewhat new \u2014 as evidenced by the chatter around the recent Grammys carpet appearance by Bianca Censori and Ye \u2014 naked fashion has been in vogue for a number of years, noted Madeline Hirsch, features director at InStyle Fashion.",
      "\u201cThough it originated on the runway, the naked dress trend is fed largely by celebrity red carpet moments \u2014 stars and their stylists can\u2019t seem to get enough,\u201d Hirsch said in an email. She added that in 2025, sheer lace is the most prominent expression of the trend \u2014 not a surprise since bohemian style is resurgent.",
      "Though many Oscar attendees, of course, opt for much more traditional looks both before and after the ceremonies, it tends to be at the after-parties where the naked look pops up the most, Hirsch said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the time when attendees can let down their hair after hours, and generally speaking, it\u2019s a lower stakes red carpet and less formal event than the ceremony itself,\u201d Hirsch said. \u201cNext-to-naked dressing matches that energy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77",
      "EDINA, Minn. -- Joey Molland, a guitarist with the Welsh pop-rock band Badfinger that was known for such 1970s hits as \u201cNo Matter What\u201d and \u201cDay After Day,\u201d has died at age 77.",
      "Molland was the last to join and had been the last survivor from the most famous lineup of the group, which recorded for the Beatles \u2019 Apple label. His death was confirmed Tuesday by Sam Sheffield-West, the funeral director at Washburn-McReavy Funeral Chapels in Edina, Minnesota. Molland had lived in the state for decades. Additional details about his death weren't immediately available.",
      "Badfinger was a quartet that also included singer-guitarist Pete Ham, bassist Tom Evans and drummer Tom Gibbins. They were among the first acts signed to Apple after the Beatles launched it in 1968 and would remain closely associated with the Beatles \u2014 not always to Badfinger's liking \u2014 throughout their brief years of success. Molland even grew up near Liverpool's Penny Lane, immortalized in the Beatles song of the same name.",
      "Badfinger's breakout hit, \u201cCome and Get It,\u201d was written and produced by Paul McCartney, and another top 10 single, \u201cDay After Day,\u201d was produced by George Harrison and featured Harrison's slide guitar. \u201cNo Matter What\u201d was produced by Apple official/Beatles assistant Mal Evans, and another Badfinger song, \u201cWithout You,\u201d became a hit for Beatles friend Harry Nilsson. Molland and his bandmates would also appear at Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for Bangladesh and provide backing on two Beatles member's solo albums: Harrison's \u201cAll Things Must Pass\u201d and John Lennon's \u201cImagine.\u201d",
      "Critics could not stop likening Badfinger's catchy melodies, layered harmonies and tight arrangements to their benefactors: \u201cIt\u2019s as if John, Paul, George, and Ringo had been reincarnated as Joey, Pete, Tom, and Mike of Badfinger,\" Rolling Stone wrote of them in 1970. Even the band's name originated from the Beatles. Badfinger had called itself the Ivies in the years preceding their joining Apple, but, at the suggestion of Apple official/Beatles assistant Neil Aspinall, agreed to change it to Badfinger. (The working title of the Beatles' \u201cWith a Little Help from My Friends\u201d was \u201cBad Finger Boogie\u201d).",
      "Their time on top ended after 1972. Amid cutbacks at Apple and allegations of financial mismanagement, Badfinger left for Warner Bros., faded commercially and sustained a tragic loss when Ham took his life in 1975. After initially breaking up, the remaining members periodically reunited but never approached their early success.",
      "Evans took his own life in 1983 and Gibbins died of a brain aneurysm in 2005.",
      "Molland remained active well after Badfinger's prime, touring until his health began to fail last year and releasing such solo albums as \u201cThis Way Up\u201d \u201cAfter the Pearl\u201d and \u201cBe True To Yourself.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was raised to go to work \u2014 to get up in the morning and go to work,\u201d he told The Associated Press in 2001.",

    "story": [
      "When Sean Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Last fall, Sean Baker was sitting in a Manhattan restaurant, talking about a poll. The survey, about sex in movies and television, showed that Gen Z moviegoers were mostly turned off by sex in film.",
      "\u201cThat broke my heart. I thought, there\u2019s something wrong here,\u201d said Baker. \u201cYou\u2019re OK with all the violence that\u2019s out there? Sex is a vital part of existence. Why don\u2019t you want to see sex in our stories?\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember being on set and being like: We\u2019re pushing against that poll.\u201d",
      "When Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d swept the 97th Academy Awards on Sunday, its five wins, including best picture, heralded a different kind of Oscar winner. \u201cAnora,\u201d about an erotic dancer (Mikey Madison, the best actress winner ) who marries the son of a Russian oligarch, is atypically sexually explicit for a best picture winner \u2014 a class that includes more staid movies like \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cDriving Miss Daisy.\u201d A young woman\u2019s relationship to her own sexuality has not been, historically speaking, in the Oscars' wheelhouse.",
      "But that\u2019s just one quality that makes \u201cAnora\u201d unique as a best picture winner. The film, made for $6 million and distributed by Neon, was made with little interest in the mainstream. If anything, \u201cAnora\u201d was more oriented to the Cannes Film Festival, the French citadel of cinema, where it won the Palme d\u2019Or last May \u2014 a prize that Baker said meant the most to him.",
      "But, increasingly, these are converging movie worlds. In the last five years, four Palme d\u2019Or winners have been nominated for best picture at the Academy Awards, including Bong Joon Ho\u2019s \u201cParasite\u201d (also distributed by Neon), which became the first non-English language movie to win Hollywood\u2019s top prize.",
      "\u201cAnora,\u201d a film that inverts a Hollywood fairy tale like \u201cPretty Woman,\u201d is \u2014 like many of the winners on Sunday \u2014 an unabashedly modern movie and a film comfortable, even proud of the label of \u201ccinema.\u201d In a movie industry where manufactured franchise stewardship rules the day, \u201cAnora\u201d was celebrated, in part, because it's the real deal.",
      "It's also a more traditional choice than it might seem. Baker, a filmmaker who has sworn off making a series, a studio film or anything for streaming, is an apostle of '70s cinema. At an Oscars that host Conan O\u2019Brien called \u201cthe 97th Longform Content Awards,\u201d \u201cAnora\u201d \u2014 which shared some of the same Brooklyn streets as \u201cThe French Connection\u201d \u2014 stood for upholding an increasingly threatened theatrical legacy, with Baker ardently defending a very old-fashioned thing: the big screen.",
      "\u201cFilmmakers, keep making films for the big screen. I know I will,\u201d Baker said from the Dolby Theatre stage. \u201cDistributors, please focus first and foremost on the theatrical releases of your films. Parents, introduce your children to feature films in movie theaters and you will be molding the next generation of movie lovers and filmmakers. And for all of us, when we can please watch movies in a theater and let\u2019s keep the great tradition of the moviegoing experience alive and well.\u201d",
      "The coronation of \u201cAnora\u201d was a triumph for independent moviemaking, but that\u2019s also been a battle waged and won before. We\u2019ve seen \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d best \u201cAvatar\u201d and \u201cMoonlight\u201d defeat \u201cLa La Land.\u201d Last year\u2019s crowning of \u201cOppenheimer\u201d was, if anything, an exception in a string of smaller best pictures that haven't fit the Oscar mold. \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2023 winner, was antic, lewd and about the furthest thing possible from \u201cOscar bait.\u201d",
      "What was different this year was that the stiffest competition for \u201cAnora\u201d wasn\u2019t \u201cWicked\u201d or \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d or any other studio product. It was \u201cConclave\u201d and \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d All of the major award winners on Sunday hailed from movies made independently. At the Oscars, the studios are out of the picture.",
      "That trend has been developing for years, but the 97th Academy Awards showed just how much things have changed. In the best animated category, where Universal and DreamWorks\u2019 \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d was the heavy favorite, \u201cFlow,\u201d a wordless Latvian movie made with open-source software, triumphed instead.",
      "\u201cAny kid now has tools that are used to make these now Academy-winning films,\u201d \u201cFlow\u201d director Gints Zilbalodis said backstage. \u201cSo I think we\u2019re going to see all kinds of exciting films being made from kids who might not have had a chance to do this before.\u201d",
      "That win, like those for \u201cAnora,\u201d suggested the academy\u2019s international voters have emerged as a dominant bloc. When the academy, reacting to pressure to diversify its ranks, brought in new members in recent years, it cast a wide net overseas. Hundreds of new international voters \u2014 people more likely to favor what succeeds in Cannes or Venice \u2014 now significantly sway the Oscars.",
      "What does that mean for the Academy Awards going forward? A further tilt toward indie and arthouse cinema will surely alienate some viewers. \u201cAnora,\u201d with $16 million in domestic ticket sales, is one of the lowest-grossing best picture winners ever. Oscar producers did everything they could to lean into bigger films, opening with a lavish medley by \u201cWicked\u201d stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, cutting repeatedly to a mascot sandworm from \u201cDune: Part Two\u201d and even paying James Bond tribute.",
      "The 007 musical number was oddly timed, coming on the heels of the franchise\u2019s creative takeover by Amazon MGM Studios after decades of Broccoli family stewardship. It seemed to only highlight how much of Hollywood\u2019s regular, day-to-day business of brand management lay outside the new Oscar landscape.",
      "But just as assuredly as an \u201cAnora\u201d Academy Awards might turn some away, it could also inspire a new generation of cinephiles. \u201cAnora\u201d is at turns screwball farce, neorealistic drama, capitalism satire and devastating tragicomedy. It\u2019s arguably one of the best best picture winners of recent years, a movie that tries on nearly every genre before concluding in an unforgettable scene that catapults \u201cAnora\u201d into something classic and outside of time.",
      "What aftershocks will follow Baker's Oscar romp remains to be seen. But shortly after the Academy Awards concluded, 3.9 magnitude tremors were felt in nearby Burbank \u2014 a fitting coda for the small quake of \u201cAnora.\u201d"

      "AL-TUWANEH, West Bank -- Just last week, Israeli troops came and tore down a Palestinian family\u2019s shed in this remote, hilly corner of the West Bank, residents say. It was the latest instance of destruction targeting a collection of hamlets whose population is threatened with expulsion.",
      "Palestinians in the Masafer Yatta area cheered the Oscar win of the documentary \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts life in the beleaguered community, and hoped it will bring them some help.",
      "In al-Tuwaneh, one of the hamlets that make up Masafer Yatta, Salem Adra said his family stayed up all night for the Oscar ceremony. They watched as his older brother, Basel Adra, the film\u2019s co-director, came on stage to accept the award for best documentary.",
      "\u201cIt was such a huge surprise, such joy,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land\u201d follows Basel Adra as he risks arrest to document the destruction of Masafer Yatta at the southern edge of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, joined by his co-director, Israeli journalist and filmmaker, Yuval Abraham.",
      "The joint Palestinian-Israeli production has won a string of international awards, starting at the Berlin International Film Festival in 2024. Five years in the making, it gained greater resonance amid Israel\u2019s devastating military campaign in Gaza that forced almost its entire population from their homes, as well as increasing raids in the West Bank that have caused the displacement of tens of thousands of Palestinians.",
      "At the same time, the film has raised hackles in Israel, scarred by the bloody the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Hamas that triggered the war.",
      "Salem Adra, who at times helped his brother film for the movie, said he hoped the Oscar win \u201copens the world\u2019s eyes to what\u2019s happening here in Masafer Yatta.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a win for all of Palestine and for everyone who lives in Masafer Yatta,\u201d he said.",
      "He said that since the film was first released, threats and pressure against his family have increased. Their car has been stoned by settlers. After the movie won an award at the Berlin International Film Festival a year ago, the military returned over and over to the family home, and once detained his father, searching his phone and asking, \u201cWhy are you filming?\u201d",
      "The Israeli military designated Masafer Yatta as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered residents, mostly Arab Bedouin, to be expelled. Israel said the Bedouin did not have permanent structures in the area. But families say they have lived and herded their sheep and goats across the area long before Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war.",
      "After a 20-year legal battle by residents, Israel\u2019s Supreme Court upheld the expulsion order in 2022. The around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but troops regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2013 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Salem Adra said the latest destruction came Wednesday, when troops tore down the shed of a family in a nearby hamlet.",
      "Standing on a stony ridge above al-Tuwaneh, Salem Adra said Jewish settlers backed by the military have set up 10 outposts around the village since Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Shepherd Raed al-Hamamdeh, 48, led his herd of goats across the rocky land. He pointed to one outpost \u2013 with tents and a trailer flying the flag of an Israeli military unit \u2013 on the other side of a small valley. Farmers no longer tend the olive grove in the valley for fear of being attacked.",
      "Al-Hamamdeh said the military uses drones to drive off herds if they get too close to the outposts. \u201cSettlers attack. When we herd sheep, we can\u2019t go far as you can see. Only up to this point can we reach,\u201d he said. He pointed to the rubble of a house that he said settlers had destroyed, driving out the family and burning their furniture.",
      "In Israel, the film garnered little media attention since its release \u2014 and what attention it did get has been angry. When it won the documentary prize at the Berlin festival, its Israeli director Abraham came under fire for an acceptance speech that called for an end to the war in Gaza without mentioning Hamas\u2019 initial attack and taking of the hostages held in Gaza.",
      "In his Oscar acceptance speech, Abraham spoke of both. But that did little to calm criticism in Israel. Culture and Sports Minister Miki Zohar called the win \u201ca sad moment for the world of cinema.\u201d He said the film distorted reality and accused its creators of using \u201cdefamation\u201d of Israel as a way help promote the documentary.",
      "Usually, Israeli films that are nominated for prestigious international prizes receive boastful accolades in Israel.",
      "But after the Hamas attack, \u201ceveryone is in mourning or in trauma, we can hardly hear any other voice on any other subject,\u201d Raya Morag, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who specializes in cinema and trauma, said last week.",
      "On Monday, she said it wasn\u2019t yet clear if the win will bring the documentary more attention in Israel. But, she said, \u201cit won\u2019t be possible for people to ignore the message of the two directors, including for people that haven\u2019t seen the film.\u201d",
      "In his acceptance speech Sunday night, Basel Adra called on the world \u201cto stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people.\u201d",
      "He said he hoped his newborn daughter would \u201cnot have to live the same life I am living now \u2026 Always feeling settler violence, home demolitions and forceful displacement.\u201d",
      "On Monday, his brother Salem walked down from the ridge along with his 4-year-old son to a family home.",

      "An artist in Denmark is seeking to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that includes three piglets starving to death",
      "An artist in Denmark aims to raise awareness of the suffering caused by modern pig production with an art installation that opened Friday that includes three piglets who will be denied food and water and will starve to death.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti is courting controversy to make a point about the treatment of pigs in Denmark, where about 25,000 piglets die daily as a result of the conditions in which they are bred.",
      "The central exhibit at Copenhagen's \u201cAnd Now You Care\u201d exhibition is a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing three piglets. As the exhibition opened Friday evening, they were still fine, but they will not be given food and drink, and can be expected to die of hunger within a few days.",
      "Evaristti says on his Instagram page that the exhibition \u201cis a confrontation with Denmark's bloody reality\u201d in slaughterhouses, and that he urges people to reduce their meat consumption and support agriculture that improves animal welfare.",
      "Denmark's largest and oldest animal welfare organization, Animal Protection Denmark, says it is grateful for Evaristti's interest in the problem, but disagrees with how he wants to convey it.",
      "\u201cWe completely understand the indignation\u201d of the artist, said Birgitte Damm, a spokesperson for the organization. \u201cBut we do not agree that three piglets, three individual living beings, should be starved and prevented from drinking until they die from it. It is illegal and it is abuse of the animals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fact that happens to thousands each day in the industry doesn\u2019t make it right,\u201d she said. But she also praised the artist for asking \u201cthe large questions about who we are as human beings or want to be, and what we are doing to fellow creatures in the name of enormous amounts of mass-produced cheap meat.\u201d",
      "Damm explained that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, and leading to the starvation of many. She said some 25,000 piglets die every day from starvation or the result of the conditions in which they are held in Denmark.",

      "He described that project called \u201cPolpette Al Grasso Di Marco\u201d as a critique on people overconsuming and then buying their way to slimness with liposuction, and at the same time an attempt to transcend the taboo of cannibalism.",

      "Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, on Rio de Janeiro\u2019s west side, but this year there\u2019s even more, with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school back in the top parade league for the first time in 57 years",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Carnival always breathes life into the economy of Vila Vintem, a favela on Rio de Janeiro's west side, but this year the pulse is even stronger with its Unidos de Padre Miguel samba school returning to the top samba parade league for the first time in almost 60 years.",
      "As one of Rio's 12 top-tier samba schools, Unidos de Padre Miguel will have its shot at fame, perhaps even glory \u2014 all while bringing in more money into its community.",
      "Last year, competing in the second division, Padre Miguel received about 900,000 reais ($150,000) from City Hall, missing out on the lucrative sponsorship deals and revenue from television rights, pre-Carnival parties and ticket sales enjoyed by top-flight samba schools. But their victory in last year's Carnival secured their place in the main event that kicks off Sunday night.",
      "The shift has sent Padre Miguel\u2019s budget this year ballooning more than tenfold, to about 11 million reais ($2 million), including nearly 2 million reais from the city, according to the samba school's deputy chairman Dr. Willie Baracho.",
      "The school has already invested a significant portion into the community, funding local seamstresses, carpenters and welders for parade preparations.",
      "Vila Vintem is already experiencing the positive effects. Several of the favela's formerly jobless residents told The Associated Press they have bought smartphones and household appliances.",
      "Padre Miguel's new headquarters, nearing completion, will relocate rehearsals and other community activities from a hangar-like space that served as a vital center for the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cOur samba school has projects, it helps people, distributes food, throws parties for our children,\u201d Luana Borges, 42, said as she fixed details on several costumes, some bearing the school's traditional red and white colors.",
      "\u201cWhen Carnival comes, it offers opportunities to people like me,\" said Borges, who used to be unemployed.",
      "Nearly all samba schools sit in working-class neighborhoods around Rio\u2019s metropolitan region and compete against each other in the legendary Sambadrome parade grounds. Favelas in Rio are typically associated with dense, hillside neighborhoods, but they feature other geographies, too. The 14,000-resident Vila Vintem cropped up almost a century ago on flatlands next to a railway under construction.",
      "When first settled, the swampy area was said to be worth not even a \u201cvintem,\u201d the cheapest coin at the time, akin to a penny. Decades passed before basic services arrived, sometimes only after residents agreed to do the work themselves.",
      "Even with its new Carnival windfall, Padre Miguel remains a financial underdog.",
      "Baracho said its more popular rivals don\u2019t depend as much on city money, and can bring in up to 18 million reais ($3 million) when accounting for corporate sponsorships, sales of merchandise, coveted parade positions and cover charges for their pre-Carnival parties.",
      "While Padre Miguel employs almost all locals, Baracho said wealthier samba schools can spend over 1 million reais, for instance, on coaches and dancers, whose performance is one of the categories scored by judges.",
      "\u201cThe sky is the limit for some, but we fight,\u201d Baracho said. \u201cWe managed to get promoted because we are invested in our people, we work hard to foster our own creativity.\"",
      "Padre Miguel will be the first samba school to parade on Sunday night. Their procession will tell the story of Iya\u0301 Nasso\u0302, the founder of the first space in Brazil for rituals of the Afro-Brazilian faith Candomble.",
      "Experts say the best path for scrappy samba schools like Padre Miguel to sustain their community impact is to focus on avoiding relegation, rather than pursuing Carnival\u2019s top prize, amounting to 20% of the revenue of the tickets sold for the Champions Parade, which takes place the following weekend.",
      "\u201cThere's little chance for a samba school to win the title coming from the second division,\" said F\u00e1tima Costa de Lima, a Carnival researcher and scenic arts professor at Santa Catarina State University. \u201cIt happened before, but it is rare. The main goal for a samba school like (Padre Miguel) is to stay on.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Lima Leal has worked for Padre Miguel for 15 years, and paraded with the school for even longer. The 66-year-old says that creating jobs in Vila Vintem and being at the world-famous parade is worth every cent. She wants to see more next year \u2014 hopefully still in the top division.",
      "While sewing a white costume in her home workshop, Leal expressed the \u201camazing emotion\u201d of marching in the parade wearing something she helped create.",
      "\u201cCarnival brings a lot of jobs. Not only here, but everywhere,\u201d she said.",

      "Police said they found the body of a German shepherd in the bathroom closet. Two other dogs were found alive on the property.",

      "The New Mexico Gas Co. tested gas lines at the home but didn't find any signs of problems at the time, according to the warrant.",

      "Hackman's performance as an obsessed and amoral cop in the 1971 film \u201cThe French Connection\" earned an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and was considered one of his defining roles. Hackman swung another Oscar for playing a sadistic sheriff in 1992's \u201cUnforgiven.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to drop an emergency abortion case in Idaho in one of its first moves on the issue since President Donald Trump began his second term.",
      "The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, which was originally filed by the Biden administration, in a reversal that could have national implications for urgent care.",
      "The lawsuit had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences in Idaho, which has one of the country's strictest abortion bans.",
      "The Democratic administration had given similar guidance to hospitals nationwide in the wake of the Supreme Court 2022 decision overturning the right to abortion. It's being challenged in other conservative states.",
      "In Idaho, the state argued that its law does allow life-saving abortions and the Biden administration wrongly sought to expand the exceptions. The state agrees with the dismissal, so it does not need judicial approval, Justice Department attorneys wrote in court documents.",
      "Idaho doctors, meanwhile, say it remains unclear which abortion are legal, forcing them to airlift pregnant women of state if a termination might be part of the standard of care. It's often unclear in fast-moving emergencies whether pregnancy complications could ultimately prove fatal, doctors said in court documents.",
      "A judge has blocked Idaho from any abortion ban enforcement that would change emergency treatment at the state's largest hospital system for now.",
      "In his first term, Trump, a Republican, appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturned the constitutional right to abortion. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year. It ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations but left key legal questions unresolved.",
      "The case went before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. Those judges have not yet ruled.",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they\u2019re pregnant."

      "A bucktoothed llama that spends his days comforting chronically ill children at a North Carolina camp founded by NASCAR royalty has been crowned the world\u2019s oldest llama in captivity.",
      "At 27 years and more than 250 days, the selfie- and snuggle-loving llama called Whitetop dethroned Dalai Llama, the Guinness World Records announced last week. Dalai lived on a ranch in Albuquerque and was announced as the oldest in 2023 shortly after his 27th birthday.",
      "Whitetop was donated to the Victory Junction camp in 2006, just two years after race car driver Kyle Petty \u2014 the son of NASCAR great Richard Petty \u2014 and his family founded the camp in honor of Petty's own son, Adam, who was 19 when he was killed in a 2000 crash while practicing for a race.",
      "The year-round free camp sits on 84 acres (34 hectares) in the Petty hometown of Randleman, North Carolina, about 75 miles (121 kilometers) west of Raleigh. It\u2019s designed for children with conditions that include cancer, kidney and heart disease, cerebral palsy, Spina Bifida and an array of neurological and physical disabilities.",
      "Whitetop has become known for his relaxed, sweet and empathetic personality. His go-to move is to lie still while campers pet him, which can comfort children and give them important sensory input, said Billie Davis, the camp's barn director.",
      "\u201cHe really gets to help campers come out of their shell when they interact with him,\" she said. \"He can be kind of intimidating at first, but once they come over to him and love on him and pet on him, they just realize how sweet he is.\u201d",
      "One of his best friends is a miniature highland cow named Gus-Gus, who tends to forget Whitetop is a llama and enjoys jumping on him. Whitetop also likes to roll in fresh wood chippings, chomp on soaked alfalfa and pose for selfies.",
      "\u201cIf you try to take a picture of him from the side, he\u2019s not into it,\" Davis said. \"He will, like scoot in there and try to get his face from a side profile so that it\u2019s like he\u2019s cheesing.\u201d",
      "Davis attributes Whitetop's long life to great veterinary care and exercise, as well as it simply loving his job.",
      "The average life span for a llama is 15 years, according to the Denver Zoo Conservation Alliance.",
      "Whitetop has developed arthritis in his twilight years but otherwise is very healthy, said Davis. And the only times the llama becomes upset is when Gus-Gus, along with two miniature donkeys named Jed and Jethro, leave him alone.",
      "Stephanie Wilkerson, 33, first went to the camp\u2019s family weekend in 2006 after she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. She said she was initially a little nervous around Whitetop but soon realized petting him and giving him hugs made her feel better.",
      "\u201cWhen I started stroking him more and more and more, I got more relaxed,\" said Wilkerson, who lives in Thomasville, North Carolina.",
      "With Whitetop\u2019s newfound fame in longevity, the camp has started selling limited edition T-shirts displaying Whitetop with sunglasses and the words, \u201cStill Spit\u2019n.\u201d The proceeds go to the camp.",
      "Although Davis said Whitetop would like people to know not all llamas spit on you.",
      "\u201cTypically llamas only spit when they are scared, uncomfortable or territorial over something,\" she said. \"And he just loves his job so much that he doesn\u2019t do it.\u201d",

      "Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the new measure",
      "CHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Women planning pill abortions in Wyoming will need to get an ultrasound after lawmakers overrode the governor's veto of the law.",
      "Wednesday's 22-9 vote by the state Senate followed a 45-16 vote by the House on Tuesday to override. In vetoing the bill Monday, Republican Gov. Mark Gordon questioned whether it was reasonable and necessary, especially for victims of rape and incest.",
      "Lawmakers cited concerns about women's well-being Wednesday in voting to override, and they cleared the two-thirds majority requirement.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very concerned about the psychological effects of this procedure,\u201d Republican Sen. Darin Smith of Cheyenne said of the governor, \u201cbut what about the psychological effects of having an abortion, for the rest of your life?\u201d",
      "The new requirement, which takes effect right away, was criticized by abortion rights advocates.",
      "\u201cWe are saddened so many legislators lack empathy and respect for women\u2019s decision-making authority, but we stand ready to fight this unconstitutional, unnecessary and unreasonable bill in court,\u201d Christine Lichtenfels, executive director of the Wyoming abortion access advocacy group Chelsea\u2019s Fund, said in a statement.",
      "Wyoming is the first state to explicitly outlaw pill abortions, though that and other abortion bans over the past three years are on hold pending a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court.",
      "Ten other states require abortion providers to perform ultrasounds on women seeking abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "Under Wyoming's new law, pregnant women planning pill abortions will have to drive potentially long distances to get an ultrasound and have it documented. They would have the opportunity but not be required to view the image of the fetus at least 48 hours before a pill abortion.",
      "Existing state law already requires abortion providers to offer an ultrasound to women getting abortions.",
      "Pregnant woman who do not get an ultrasound will not be penalized under the new law, however. Instead it is medical providers who face up to $9,000 in fines and six months in jail for not arranging it.",
      "But there are few if any active abortion providers left. Last week the state's only full-service abortion clinic stopped providing any abortion care, surgical or medicinal, after Gordon signed a bill requiring such facilities to be licensed as surgical centers.",
      "Wellspring Health Access in Casper is wary of running afoul of the law while it challenges it and others in court, President Julie Burkhart said.",
      "It was not clear whether Wyoming's only other clinic providing medication abortions, a family medicine practice in Jackson, continues to do so. There was no response to phone messages left with the clinic seeking comment Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Pill abortions remain possible in the state through remote services: Women have access through the Just the Pill telehealth service and online providers such as Abuzz, The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, and Aid Access, according to Chelsea\u2019s Fund.",
      "The Guttmacher Institute found that more than 3 in 5 abortions carried out in the U.S. through the formal health care system in 2023 were medicinal. Wyoming had the biggest portion of abortions via pill that year: 19 in 20.",

      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case",
      "A yearslong legal battle over the right to an emergency abortion in Idaho has been abruptly upended now that President Donald Trump has moved to drop the high-profile case.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department had argued that emergency-room doctors treating pregnant women had to provide terminations if it was needed to save their lives or to avoid serious health consequences.",
      "Yet a little more than a month after taking over the White House, Trump's decision to abandon the legal fight signals how the Republican administration plans on interpreting federal law designed to protect urgent care when up against states' abortion bans.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to an abortion. The ruling came down while President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was in office, but many of the justices who helped reverse Roe v. Wade were appointed under Trump.",
      "So in response, Biden warned that his administration considered abortion part of the stabilizing care that federal law requires facilities to provide to patients who show up at an emergency room. A month later, Biden sued Idaho, which had enacted an abortion ban that makes it a crime with a prison term of up to five years for anyone who performs or assists in an abortion.",
      "The Biden administration argued that Idaho\u2019s abortion ban prevented ER doctors from offering an abortion if a woman needs one in a medical emergency. But Idaho\u2019s attorney general has pointed out that federal law also requires hospitals to consider the health of the \u201cunborn child\u201d in its treatment, too.",
      "The lawsuit has twisted and turned in the legal system ever since. Last year, the Supreme Court agreed to step into the Idaho case, but it handed down a narrow ruling: Hospitals were allowed to make determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations, but the key legal question about what care hospitals should legally provide remains unresolved.",
      "Known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, the 1986 law requires emergency rooms to offer a medical exam if you turn up at their facility. The law applies to any ERs that accept Medicare funding \u2014 so nearly all of them.",
      "Those ERs are also required to stabilize patients experiencing a medical emergency before discharging or transferring them. Notably, if the ER doesn't have the resources or staff to treat a patient, medical staffers must arrange a medical transfer to another hospital \u2014 they can't simply direct a patient to go elsewhere.",
      "EMTALA is more scrutinized than ever since Roe was overturned. Multiple doctors and families have told The Associated Press about pregnant women with dangerous medical conditions showing up in hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices only to be denied the abortions that could help treat them. Some women described facing harmful delays.",
      "Not yet. And the DOJ's three-page motion didn't explain why they wanted to abandon the lawsuit either. However, since having a hand in revoking the constitutional right to abortion, Trump has repeatedly touted his support of leaving abortion regulations up to the states.",
      "Meanwhile, ending the effort to use federal law to protect emergency abortions was a goal of Project 2025, the blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, which calls for reversing what it describes as \u201cdistorted pro-abortion\u201d interpretations of federal law. Trump insisted during his 2024 presidential campaign that Project 2025 was not part of his agenda.",
      "\u201cTheir move to drop this case against Idaho I think really shows what their true priorities are \u2014 and it is to push an anti-abortion political agenda rather than support the lives, health and well being of pregnant women and people, not just in Idaho but across the country because this case does have far-reaching impact,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers.",
      "Trump's decision to drop the Idaho case comes several months after the Supreme Court said the federal government couldn't require hospitals to provide pregnancy terminations when it would violate Texas' abortion ban.",
      "Texas had sued over the Biden administration's enforcement of EMTALA, and a lower federal court eventually sided with the state. But similar to the case in Idaho, the Supreme Court stopped short of deciding whether the federal law can supersede a state's abortion ban.",
      "Meanwhile, concern has grown over whether Trump's decision in the Idaho case is a sign that his administration may also reverse course in a longstanding legal battle over telehealth access to mifepristone, the medication used in the nation's most common abortion method.",
      "The Department of Justice under Biden had sought to dismiss a complaint brought by a handful states seeking to roll back access to mifepristone. It's currently unclear how Trump plans on proceeding."

      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's Senate passed two bills Monday that would ban most gender-affirming care for minors and people incarcerated in state prisons, mirroring moves by Republicans across states and a handful of executive orders by President Donald Trump targeting transgender people.",
      "The chamber voted 34-19 for a bill that would ban puberty blockers and most gender-affirming care for people under 18, including those already undergoing treatment. Georgia lawmakers in 2023 banned most gender-affirming surgeries and hormone replacement therapies for transgender minors unless they were already receiving treatment. The law lets doctors prescribe puberty blockers.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re asking (minors) to make changes that will have changes to the rest of their lives,\u201d bill sponsor Republican Sen. Ben Watson, of Savannah, said Monday. \u201cIt is not a fair decision to them. It is not a fair decision to the parents.\u201d",
      "A second bill sponsored by Senate Majority Whip Randy Robertson passed 37-15 and would ban most gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in state prisons.",
      "Last month, the chamber passed bills to ban transgender people from playing in school sports and cut off public funding for gender-affirming care for adults. The four bills will now head to the House for debate.",
      "Opponents said Republicans are playing politics by targeting transgender people and that lawmakers should focus on helping Georgians with more pressing issues such as housing and healthcare. They say both bills infringe on the rights of transgender people and their families to make decisions about gender-affirming care.",
      "\u201cThis body has promulgated bill after bill attacking trans people with the ultimate goal of making trans fols disappear. We\u2019ve been here before,\" said Senate Minority Whip Kim Jackson, a Stone Mountain Democrat who is openly lesbian.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting gender-affirming care for minors, and most are facing lawsuits. A study released in January found that fewer than 1 in 1,000 adolescents with commercial insurance during a five-year period received gender-affirming medications such as puberty blockers or hormones.",
      "Jackson and other Democrats proposed a failed amendment to Watson\u2019s bill that would let minors receiving treatment keep going to avoid the medical and emotional ramifications of stopping midway.",
      "Sens. Elena Parent and Sonya Halpern, both Atlanta Democrats, reaffirmed their commitment to protecting the rights of transgender people but broke with their party to vote for Robertson\u2019s bill because they said they do not think taxpayers should pay for gender-affirming care for people in prison. Parent proposed an amendment to make an exception for incarcerated people already undergoing hormone replacement therapy that failed.",
      "\u201cI will not let my party be dragged into an argument that makes us look out of touch with the very people we claim to represent,\u201d Halpern said.",
      "Sen. Sally Harrell, an Atlanta Democrat who has two transgender children, took the stand toward the end of the evening.",
      "\u201cIt felt like we were debating a political football instead of people,\" Harrell said of a debate on the school sports bill. \"And so I came to this well to remind people that we are talking about very real people \u2014 parents, children, families.\u201d",

      "Food and Drug Administration nominee Dr. Marty Makary is known for his contrarian views and fiery criticism of traditional medical institutions",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Marty Makary rose to national attention by skewering the medical establishment in books and papers and bashing the federal response to COVID-19 on TV.",
      "Now the Johns Hopkins University surgeon and researcher has been nominated to lead the Food and Drug Administration. The agency \u2014 responsible for regulating products ranging from toothpaste to vaccines \u2014 is famously understated, issuing carefully worded statements devoid of opinion or scientific speculation.",
      "That's the opposite approach of Makary, whose sweeping rhetoric and biting criticism often veer into hyperbole, according to a review of recent speeches, interviews and podcast appearances by The Associated Press.",
      "Makary has called the U.S. food supply \u201cpoison,\u201d says the federal government is the \u201cgreatest perpetrator of misinformation\u201d about COVID-19 and regularly suggests that pesticides, fluoride and overuse of antibiotics may be to blame for rising rates of infertility, attention deficit disorder and other health conditions. He\u2019ll appear Thursday before a Senate panel considering his nomination.",
      "Makary\u2019s views align with those of the man who would be his boss: Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the U.S. health secretary who built a following by sowing doubts about vaccines, ultraprocessed foods and fluoride. Notably, Makary has never embraced Kennedy\u2019s discredited idea that vaccines might cause autism.",
      "Experts who have worked with Makary say his contrarian approach could be useful at FDA \u2014 but only if he\u2019s able to resist political pressure from Kennedy and others on hot-button issues like vaccines.",
      "\u201cHe has this reputation of being someone who cares about evidence and transparency,\u201d said Dr. Reshma Ramachandran of Yale University, who was part of an informal research group with Makary. \u201cThe question is whether he\u2019s going to preserve and defend the integrity of the agency or is he going to fall in line with the administration.\u201d",
      "Makary did not respond to an AP interview request.",
      "Trained as a pancreatic surgeon, Makary\u2019s initial work focused on uncontroversial topics like hospital costs and surgical checklists.",
      "In 2016, he made headlines with a paper stating that medical errors were \u201cthe third leading cause of death in the U.S.\u201d That conclusion was quickly disputed by other experts, who said the paper\u2019s death estimate was ten times higher than more rigorous reviews.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Makary reached a much broader audience as a regular on Fox News, where he opposed vaccine mandates and called the FDA \u201cbroken\u201d and \u201cmired in politics and red tape.\u201d",
      "Makary often directs his harshest criticism toward the \u201cmedical hubris\u201d of fellow doctors, as in his latest book \u201cBlind Spots,\u201d which catalogues a number of cases where experts \u201cgot the science perfectly backwards.\u201d",
      "For example, he examines early recommendations that parents delay giving babies peanut-based foods due to allergy risks. Today, pediatricians generally recommend earlier introduction to prevent food allergies.",
      "Many researchers view such examples differently.",
      "\u201cThese are cases of people doing the best they can with evolving information and needing to make decisions along the way,\u201d said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School. \u201cAs commissioner, he\u2019s going to have to be OK with making decisions based on evolving evidence \u2014 and some of those decisions might be wrong.\u201d",
      "Like others in Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, Makary says many of the chronic health problems afflicting Americans may be related to food additives, pesticides and other chemicals.",
      "\u201cHow about research on the pesticides that have hormone effects in children that may explain the declining fertility and lowering age of puberty?\u201d Makary asked, in a September podcast with Dr. Drew Pinsky.",
      "New York University food researcher Marion Nestle says Makary\u2019s questions \u201care extremely difficult to settle,\u201d because there\u2019s no way to ethically do the type of research needed to reach a firm conclusion: give one group of children food with pesticides and compare them with a control group getting food not grown with pesticides.",
      "\u201cI sympathize with his frustration and think we would be much better off with a lot fewer pesticides in our food supply, but I tend to view these issues more cautiously,\u201d Nestle said.",
      "Nutrition experts also say it\u2019s overly simplistic to declare all ultraprocessed foods harmful, since the category includes an estimated 60% of U.S. foods, including granola, peanut butter and ice cream.",
      "\u201cThey are not all created equal,\u201d said Gabby Headrick of George Washington University. \u201cIt is much more complicated than just pointing the finger at ultraprocessed foods as the driver of chronic disease in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe greatest perpetrator of misinformation during the pandemic has been the United States government,\u201d Makary told House lawmakers during a 2023 roundtable hosted by Republicans.",
      "Among the many COVID-19 policies Makary attacked was the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. That group received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild. Complicating the issue was the fact that COVID-19 itself also caused cases of myocarditis that were usually more severe.",
      "A 2022 paper coauthored by Makary concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions.",
      "\u201cThey made mistake after mistake and every time it either minimized the vaccine\u2019s benefits or exaggerated the risks,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris of the University of Washington, who published a critique of the work. \u201cThis paper really fed the whole notion that the vaccine is worse than the disease.\u201d",
      "Makary's conclusion contradicted that of U.K. experts and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimated the booster prevented 114 hospitalizations for every seven it caused in young people.",
      "Despite such pushback, Makary told Congress that CDC and FDA \u201clied to the American people\u201d about the need for boosters and other COVID measures.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, an FDA vaccine adviser, says the Biden administration made missteps in rolling out boosters, including announcing plans to make them available for all age groups before outside experts had weighed in. But, Offit said, Makary\u2019s language has damaged public trust in health institutions, including the one he\u2019s been picked to lead.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rhetoric that\u2019s purposefully inflammatory to win over a certain crowd, which is part of today\u2019s zeitgeist of disdaining public health agencies,\u201d Offit said. \u201cSo he\u2019s offered the position at FDA because he has disdain for the agency.\u201d",

      "James Harrison, who was credited with saving 2.4 million babies through blood plasma donations over six decades, has died at 88",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison\u2019s plasma contained a rare antibody, known as anti-D, which is used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman\u2019s immune system attacks her fetus\u2019 red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh negative blood type and her baby\u2019s is Rh positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors who help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, aged 81.",
      "\u201cHe did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\u201d Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service said Harrison was renowned as the \u201cMan with the Golden Arm.\u201d",
      "He was credited with saving the lives of 2.4 million babies through his plasma donations, the national agency responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, also known as Lifeblood, said in a statement.",
      "Lifeblood chief executive Stephen Cornelissen said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\u201cJames was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\u201d Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\u201cIt was James\u2019 belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\u201d Cornelissen added.",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison\u2019s daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",
      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed a high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",

      "Police say a security guard at an Arizona emergency medical facility was shot and wounded and a suspect is in custody",
      "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- A security guard at an Arizona hospital was shot and wounded over the weekend, and the man suspected in the attack was quickly disarmed and taken into custody, authorities say.",
      "The security guard was shot around 1 p.m. Sunday inside the emergency room at HonorHealth Scottsdale Shea Medical Center, Scottsdale Police said in a news release.",
      "The shooting was the latest in a series of incidents of increasing violence against U.S. healthcare workers and highlighted the challenges of protecting them.",
      "The 30-year-old suspect was disarmed and detained by other members of the security team and staff before arriving officers arrested him, police said.",
      "Police on Monday identified the suspect as Maximillian Yanofsky. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail on multiple charges including aggravated assault, police said.",
      "Efforts to contact a lawyer for Yanofsky on Monday weren't immediately successful.",
      "The security guard was taken to a trauma center for a higher level of care and remained hospitalized Monday, police said. A different security guard was injured in the hand and wrist during the incident, police said.",
      "Police said Yanofsky had been taken to HonorHealth Shea earlier in the day as a potential patient.",
      "No reason for the shooting was given. Police said officers were called about a disturbance in the emergency room that escalated to an altercation with security. Police said that during the altercation, Yanofsky took out a gun and shot the guard once in the upper body.",
      "Late last month, a man carrying a pistol and zip ties entered a Pennsylvania hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and took staff members hostage before he was killed by police in a shootout that also left an officer dead, authorities said.",
      "Last year, a man shot two corrections officers in the ambulance bay of an Idaho hospital while freeing a white supremacist gang member before he could be returned to prison. They were caught less than two days later.",
      "Healthcare and social assistance employees suffered almost three-quarters of nonfatal attacks on workers in the private sector in 2021 and 2022 for a rate more than five times the national average, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics."

      "Measles has sickened nearly 150 mostly unvaccinated people in rural West Texas, and a school-age child has died",
      "SEMINOLE, Texas -- Measles had struck this West Texas town, sickening dozens of children, but at the Community Church of Seminole, more than 350 worshippers gathered for a Sunday service. Sitting elbow-to-elbow, they filled the pews, siblings in matching button-down shirts and dresses, little girls\u2019 hair tied neatly into pink bows.",
      "Fathers shushed babbling toddlers as their wives snuck out to change infants' diapers.",
      "A little girl in this mostly Mennonite congregation was among those who\u2019d fallen ill with the highly contagious respiratory disease, senior pastor David Klassen said \u2014 but she\u2019s doing fine, and she happily played through her quarantine. He heard that at least two Mennonite schools shut down for a bit to disinfect.",
      "What he hasn\u2019t heard: Any direct outreach from public health officials on what to do as the number of those sickened with measles has grown to 146 and a school-age child has died. And though Klassen is a trusted church and community leader, his congregants haven\u2019t asked about whether they should vaccinate their kids \u2014 and he wouldn\u2019t want to weigh in.",
      "\u201cWith this measles situation, I can honestly just tell you we haven\u2019t taken any steps as a church,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did leave it up to the mothers.\u201d",
      "As measles \u2014 a preventable disease the U.S. considered eliminated in 2000 \u2014 spreads through West Texas\u2019 rural expanse, Klassen is sticking to an approach on vaccines that is a key tenet for Mennonites. Family leaders are the top decision-making authority \u2014 not outside recommendations, certainly not government mandates.",
      "Alongside measles in this region, where voters overwhelmingly supported President Donald Trump, there\u2019s another outbreak: one of misinformation about vaccines, distrust of local public health officials and fear of governmental authority overruling family autonomy. And on the national stage, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the country\u2019s top health official and an anti-vaccine activist, dismissed the Texas outbreak as \u201cnot unusual.\u201d",
      "\u201cDo I trust all the vaccines? No,\u201d Klassen said. \u201cAnd I get from (Kennedy) that he doesn\u2019t trust all the vaccines, either. And he is very well educated in that; I\u2019m not.\u201d",
      "In an opinion piece for Fox News Digital, Kennedy wrote about the value of the vaccine but stopped short of calling on families to get it, saying the decision is \u201ca personal one.\u201d He urged parents to speak to their health care providers about options.",
      "Vaccine skepticism has also been spurred by state lawmakers who this year filed more than a dozen bills that would strengthen or expand vaccine exemptions, which Texas already allows for \u201creasons of conscience, including a religious belief.\u201d",
      "At hospitals in Lubbock, 80 miles to the north and on the front lines of the outbreak, babies with measles are struggling to breathe.",
      "Dr. Summer Davies, a Texas Tech Physicians pediatrician, said she has treated about 10 of the outbreak\u2019s patients, most very young or teens. She said children have had to be intubated, including one younger than 6 months old. Others come in with such high fevers or severe sore throats that they refuse to eat or drink to the point of dehydration.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard as a pediatrician, knowing that we have a way to prevent this and prevent kids from suffering and even death,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do agree that the herd immunity that we have established in the past isn\u2019t the same now. And I think kids are suffering because of that.\u201d",
      "In Lubbock County, 92% of kindergarteners are up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella shots, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That\u2019s lower than the 95% threshold experts say is needed to prevent measles from spreading. Gaines County, which includes Seminole, has an 82% MMR vaccination rate, though rates for homeschooled or private school students may be much lower. The vaccine series is required for kids before entering kindergarten in public schools nationwide. Many Mennonite families don\u2019t send children to public schools.",
      "All of the children admitted with measles to Covenant Children\u2019s Hospital in Lubbock were unvaccinated, officials said last week. Dr. Lara Johnson, the hospital\u2019s chief medical officer, told The Associated Press that Covenant has seen more than 20 patients, including children, teens and pregnant mothers, since the outbreak began in late January.",
      "News of a measles case in Seminole, population 7,200, put doctors on a \u201cshared high alert,\u201d said Dr. Martin Ortega, a family physician for Texas Tech Physicians in Odessa, about an hour away. The small towns of West Texas may look completely isolated on a map, with little between them beyond oil and gas facilities and sprawling desert. But the region is connected by its people, who regularly travel long distances to grocery stores, hospitals and houses of worship.",
      "Many doctors are seeing measles cases for the first time in their careers. In Lea County, New Mexico, 30 minutes west of Seminole, nine measles cases with no clear connection to the Texas outbreak, rattled doctors and parents. An unvaccinated infant in Austin also tested positive for measles after an overseas vacation.",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca little bit surreal,\u201d said Dr. Rumbidzai Mutikani, a pediatrician at Nor-Lea Hospital District\u2019s Hobbs Medical Clinic. Parents were so concerned \u201cour phones were just ringing,\u201d Mutikani said.",
      "Katherine Wells, director of Lubbock\u2019s public health department, said West Texas' rural landscape is a major challenge, not just in getting to patients and transporting test samples, but also in getting the word out.",
      "A lot of the messaging is word of mouth, she said, but they are working on public-service announcements featuring trusted Gaines County residents, putting up billboards about measles, handing out flyers and posting in WhatsApp groups.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic caused \u201ca lot of distrust in public health\u201d and government requirements, Wells said. On Facebook, people have accused her of making up the measles outbreak. They hope her department loses its funding.",
      "It\u2019s \u201creally hurtful stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re really working to help encourage vaccines for our community and help those kids that are infected to make sure they get medical treatment so that we don\u2019t end up with another death.\u201d",
      "The reality on the ground can be nuanced, however.",
      "Brownfield Mayor Eric Horton is pro-Trump, he said, but also pro-MMR vaccine.",
      "His county was hard-hit by COVID-19, Horton said, with nearly 90 deaths. So when measles cases came to his town of 8,600, Horton feared for his community. He said the local hospital has been busy administering vaccines since the outbreak started.",
      "\u201cOut here on the south plains of Texas, we are conservative people, but we also are not anti-vaxxers,\u201d he said.",
      "Across the region, people echoed this sentiment about routine childhood vaccinations in interviews with the AP and The Texas Tribune. Often, though, they are less supportive of COVID-19 and flu shots.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that (Mennonites) don\u2019t vaccinate, and they put other people\u2019s families and children at exposure for it,\u201d said Stephen Spruill, a 36-year-old trucker from Seminole.",
      "But \"this is America. People have the right to choose.\u201d",
      "Macey Lane, 31, of Hobbs, said: \u201cI do support Donald Trump. I don\u2019t support not requiring vaccines.\u201d\u201c",
      "All of Lane\u2019s kids are vaccinated. Praising Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s vote against Kennedy\u2019s nomination, she said the fact that \u201cthe only Republican that went against RFK was a polio survivor says a lot.\u201d But she said she voted off other issues: her religious beliefs, stance on abortion and who would be best for the region\u2019s oil and gas industry.",
      "\u201cAs far as RFK being an anti-vaxxer, this is the most important thing: People have to make a decision for themselves and be as informed as they possibly can,\u201d Horton said.",
      "But in doctors' offices throughout the region, pediatricians see the consequences of that stance.",
      "Mutikani, the Hobbs pediatrician, said she\u2019s seen vaccine hesitancy increase in recent years as parents come to her with worries that line up with what\u2019s trending on social media. \u201cVirulent\u201d misinformation is especially worrisome in rural areas with few news sources or where many people who don\u2019t regularly see doctors live, she said.",
      "And having \u201cthese really big, respected public figures openly going against the grain, going against research and what we know, it makes it really, really difficult,\u201d she said.",
      "Most Texans are still vaccinating their kids, including Jennifer Sanchez, a 26-year-old Odessa resident. She took her 6-year-old and 1-year-old to the local public health department last week to get the measles vaccine.",
      "She is disinfecting her house out of an abundance of caution, wishing she had more information on how to stop the spread.",

      "Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, a Stanford University professor, was an outspoken critic of the government\u2019s COVID-19 shutdowns and vaccine policies. Now he\u2019s poised to become director of the NIH, long called the government\u2019s crown jewel, as it faces mass firings and drastic funding cutbacks.",

      "But he faces scrutiny from Democrats furious that turmoil at the nation\u2019s largest funder of medical research threatens the development of cures and new treatments.",
      "\u201cIt is incredibly important that we have a leader at NIH who will stand up for the agency\u2019s role as a world leader in lifesaving research,\u201d said Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state.",
      "Until recently, the $48 billion NIH had strong bipartisan support. NIH scientists conduct cutting-edge research at its 27 institutes specializing in diseases including cancer, chronic illnesses such as heart, lung and kidney disease, aging and Alzheimer\u2019s. Most of the agency\u2019s budget is dispersed to universities, hospitals and other research groups through highly competitive grants to conduct everything from basic research to clinical trials.",
      "NIH-funded research has played a part in the development of most treatments approved in the U.S. in recent years.",
      "Bhattacharya gained public attention as one of three authors of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 open letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm and argued that people at low risk of COVID-19 should live normally while building up immunity through infection.",
      "At the time -- before vaccinations had begun \u2013 that view was embraced by some in the first Trump administration but was widely denounced by infectious disease experts. Then- NIH director Dr. Francis Collins called it dangerous and \u201cnot mainstream science.\u201d",
      "Bhattacharya became a plaintiff in a Supreme Court case, Murthy v. Missouri, arguing he was \u201cunfairly censored\u201d on social media as part of government efforts to combat misinformation. While the case gained national attention, it was ultimately unsuccessful in a 6-3 ruling.",

      "Eating greasy food can keep you awake at night",
      "Anyone who has ever suffered in bed after eating three slices of pizza could surmise there is some relationship between food and sleep quality.",
      "For Marie-Pierre St-Onge, the director of Columbia University\u2019s Center of Excellence for Sleep and Circadian Research, years of studying the relationship confirmed it.",
      "Data from large-scale population studies showed that eating a lot of saturated fat and simple carbohydrates made it harder to get deep, restorative sleep, she said. The inverse was also true. People who don\u2019t get enough sleep, for example, were more likely to be obese.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cycle of having poor sleep leading to poor dietary choices, and lower dietary quality that further propels poor sleep,\u201d St-Onge said.",
      "If bad food could keep you awake, she wondered, can good food help you sleep? Her research led to a new cookbook, \u201cEat Better, Sleep Better,\u201d co-written with Kat Craddock, editor-in-chief of the food magazine Saveur.",
      "St-Onge said the answer is yes. The book's recipes reflect her findings that people with high-fiber diets report better sleep, and the dishes rely heavily on what she called sleep-supporting ingredients.",
      "Nuts, seeds and whole grains such as barley, buckwheat and kasha contain melatonin, a compound the body also produces naturally to regulate the circadian rhythm. Research suggests the anti-inflammatory properties of ginger and turmeric improve sleep quality, as do the phytochemicals in brightly colored fruits and vegetables like squash, cherries, bananas and beefsteak tomatoes, St-Onge said.",
      "Besides the properties of particular ingredients, the combination of certain foods is key to encouraging your body to produce the hormones it needs to fall and stay sleep, she said. Tryptophan, for example, is an essential amino acid only found in food, but it requires nutrients such as magnesium, zinc and B vitamins to be converted into melatonin and serotonin.",
      "St-Onge noted that people shouldn\u2019t expect to fall dead asleep after loading up on certain ingredients at dinner. Food has to be processed, with chemical reactions transforming nutrients over time before they are absorbed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making sure you have a healthy diet across the day to have the nutrients at the ready,\u201d she said.",
      "Recipes were developed for every meal of the day, plus snacks and desserts, the authors said. The two then arranged them into a 28-day meal plan designed to improve your sleep.",
      "Craddock said developing the recipes came naturally because the research stressed using a variety of foods she likes to cook with anyway. The challenge was making sure the recipes fell within the nutritional requirements.",
      "\u201cMy instincts are to go hard on bacon and butter and cheese and heavy cream, and she pared a lot of that back,\u201d Craddock said.",
      "Instead of bacon, Craddock said, she could achieve similar flavors with a little olive oil and smoked paprika. \u201cIt was a bit of a dance back and forth between my more restaurant approach to making foods delicious and her nutritional goals.\u201d",
      "A Creole gumbo recipe, for instance, is inspired more by a vegetarian version often served during Lent than the heavier traditional one. The andouille often used \u2014 a pork product high in saturated fat \u2014 is swapped out for healthier chicken sausage. Adding more than a pound of mixed greens makes it more like a vegetable stew, and brown rice adds a complex carbohydrate.",
      "With numerous charts and scientific research, the book is a practical guide to improving your diet in general. But Craddock said it also introduces people to international ingredients and dishes so they might think beyond what they eat every day.",
      "\u201cIf you dig a little deeper and look a little further, there are healthful and flavorful and exciting ingredients from many cultures that are right in our own backyard,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Every time a baby is born in Louisiana, where Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson handily won reelection last year, there\u2019s more than a 60% chance taxpayers will finance the birth through Medicaid.",
      "In Republican Rep. David Valadao \u2019s central California district, 6 out of 10 people use Medicaid to pay for doctor visits and emergency room trips.",
      "And one-third of the population is covered by Medicaid in GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski's Alaska, one of the nation\u2019s costliest corners for health care.",
      "Each of these Republicans \u2014 and some of their conservative colleagues \u2014 lined up last week to defend Medicaid, in a departure from long-held GOP policies. Republicans, who already have ruled out massive cuts to Social Security and Medicare, are turning their attention to siphoning as much as $880 billion from Medicaid over the next decade to help finance $4.5 trillion in tax cuts.",
      "But as a deadline to avoid a partial government shutdown nears, hesitation is surfacing among Washington's Republican lawmakers \u2014 once reliable critics of lofty government social welfare programs such as Medicaid \u2014 who say that deep cuts to the health care program could prove too untenable for people back home.",
      "\u201cI've heard from countless constituents who tell me the only way they can afford health care is through programs like Medicaid,\u201d Valadao said on the House floor. \u201cAnd I will not support a final reconciliation bill that risks leaving them behind.\u201d",
      "And on Wednesday, President Donald Trump, too, made his position on Medicaid clear: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to touch it.\u201d",
      "States and the federal government jointly pay for Medicaid, which offers nearly-free health care coverage for roughly 80 million poor and disabled Americans, including millions of children. It cost $880 billion to operate in 2023.",
      "Johnson has ruled out two of the biggest potential cuts: paying fixed, shrunken rates to states for care and changing the calculation for the share of federal dollars that each state receives for Medicaid. Just a few years ago, Johnson spearheaded a report that lobbied for some of those changes during the first Trump administration.",
      "Johnson insisted in a CNN interview that the focus will instead be ferreting out \u201cfraud, waste and abuse, in Medicaid, although it's unlikely to deliver the savings Republicans seek.",
      "GOP pressure over Medicaid is mounting, with some state party leaders joining the calls to preserve the program. States are already struggling with the growing cost of sicker patients and could be left to cover more if the federal government pulls back. In some states, the federal government picks up over 80%.",
      "More than a dozen Minnesota GOP lawmakers wrote the president recently warning that \u201ctoo deep of a cut is unmanageable in any instance.\u201d Gov. Joe Lombardo, R-Nev., told Congress in a letter that \u201cproposed reductions would put lives at risk.\" In Alaska, state Senate Majority Leader Cathy Giessel, a Republican and nurse, cited \u201chuge concerns\u201d during a floor speech.",
      "Nationally, 55% of Americans said the government spends too little on Medicaid, according to a January poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s now a very popular program that touches a very broad cross-section of American society,\u201d said Drew Altman, president of the health care research firm KFF. \u201cRoughly half of the American people say that they or a family member have at one time been served by the program.\u201d",
      "Significant changes to Medicaid are still on the table. They have to be for Republicans get the savings they need to pay for tax cuts.",
      "Work requirements, which could save as much as $109 billion over the next decade, seem to have solid support among GOP members, with some individual Republican-led states already moving to implement them.",
      "Republicans also could consider cuts in benefits or coverage, as well as eliminating a provider tax that states use to finance Medicaid, Altman added.",
      "Democrats warn that reductions are inevitable and could be dire.",
      "Starting Monday, TV ads will caution people across 20 congressional districts that hospitals are at risk of closing and millions of people could lose coverage if Republicans cut Medicaid \"to fund massive tax cuts for Elon Musk and billionaires.\u201d The Democratic super political action committee House Majority Forward has launched the seven-figure campaign.",
      "Trump and Republicans have for years called to lower government spending on health care, but they have struggled to formulate a serious plan that gains traction. Trump, for example, has spent nearly a decade arguing for an overhaul of the Affordable Care Act. His efforts to repeal the Obama-era national health care law failed during his first term and in his most recent presidential campaign he offered only \u201cconcepts of a plan\u201d to adapt the program.",
      "Michael Cannon, a director of health studies at libertarian Cato Institute, believes Medicaid needs an overhaul because it is a significant part of the federal budget and a contributor to the nation's growing debt.",
      "But Republicans, he said, are not looking at serious ways to drive down the cost of health care.",
      "\u201cThe only reason for the cuts right now is to pay for the tax cuts,\u201d Cannon said. \u201cNone of them are talking about the need to do better health reform.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Forest Service has terminated $75 million awarded to the Arbor Day Foundation to help disadvantaged communities plant trees",
      "Arthur Johnson has lived in New Orleans' Lower 9th Ward for nearly three decades, long enough to appreciate the trees that filter pollution from the big ships traveling the nearby Mississippi River and that offer shade on sweltering summer days.",
      "When Hurricane Katrina roared through two decades ago, it wiped out 200,000 trees across the city, including many in Johnson's neighborhood and several in his own yard. The city has struggled ever since to restore its tree canopy.",
      "Those efforts will be set back by the U.S. Forest Service's decision in mid-February to terminate a $75 million grant to the Arbor Day Foundation, which was working to plant trees in neighborhoods that might not otherwise be able to afford them. The program is the latest victim of a drive by President Donald Trump's administration against environmental justice initiatives.",
      "In New Orleans, part of the money was going to the environmental group Sustaining Our Urban Landscape (SOUL), which has planted more than 1,600 trees in the historically Black community but has now paused plans for another 900.",
      "Those are trees that largely low-income residents otherwise couldn\u2019t afford to plant or maintain, said the 71-year-old Johnson, who runs a local nonprofit, the Lower 9th Ward Center for Sustainable Engagement and Development, that has helped SOUL with its work and done some tree plantings of its own in the area.",
      "\u201cYou're not just cutting out the tree, the environment\u201d with such cuts, said Johnson. If those trees aren\u2019t replaced and more aren\u2019t continually added, \u201cit really takes a toll on the sustainability of the Lower 9th Ward and its community.\u201d",
      "The benefits of trees are vast. They capture stormwater and replenish groundwater. They help clean the air in polluted areas, improve mental health, and cool air and surfaces of the built environment, especially during heat waves that are growing more intense and frequent with climate change.",
      "One study by the UCLA Luskin Center found that shade can reduce heat stress on the human body from 25% to 35% throughout the day. And much research shows that low-income and communities of color have fewer trees \u2014 and are hotter \u2014 than better-off neighborhoods.",
      "The Arbor Day Fund's grant was part of former President Joe Biden's signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which sent $1.5 billion to the forest service\u2019s Urban and Community Forestry program. In a Feb. 14 email canceling the grant, the Forest Service wrote that the award \"no longer effectuates agency priorities regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion programs and activities.\u201d",
      "But Dan Lambe, the Arbor Day Foundation's chief executive, said the projects weren't just going to serve disadvantaged people. They were going to benefit every member of the community, he said. In total, 105 nonprofits, municipalities and Indigenous organizations \u2014 from Alaska to Florida to Maine \u2014 have lost funding for critical environmental projects, the foundation said.",
      "\u201cThis was an opportunity to make a really meaningful impact on people\u2019s lives, so it\u2019s been disappointing,\" Lambe said.",
      "The Forest Service didn't say if other recipients of the $1.5 billion forestry investment also had grants terminated. In a statement, its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said the agency was following directions to comply with Trump's executive orders.",
      "\u201cProtecting the people and communities we serve, as well as the infrastructure, businesses, and resources they depend on to grow and thrive, remains a top priority for the USDA and the Forest Service,\u201d the agency said.",
      "For SOUL in New Orleans, losing the grant means they don't have the money to water trees already planted, and they've had to drop plans to hire three people. Another $2.5 million grant is on hold due to the federal funding freeze, and founder and executive director Susannah Burley said the nonprofit's survival is uncertain. Its annual budget is a little more than $1 million.",
      "\u201cWe kind of are lost because we don\u2019t know if we should be planning to close our doors or if we should be planning for next season,\u201d she said.",
      "For others who were set to get Arbor Day Foundation money, the loss is not existential but still devastating. In the city-county of Butte-Silver Bow in southwest Montana, forester Trevor Peterson was going to use a $745,250 grant to buy chain saws, rigging gear and other essential tools, remove up to 200 dead or dying cottonwoods and plant as many as 1,000 trees as part of a decades-long effort to replenish trees cut to make way for copper mining. He wanted to help organize large community events focused on education, hoping to impart the knowledge necessary for future stewardship of the urban forest.",
      "\u201cWe will now have to go back to the drawing board to determine where to go from here,\u201d he said.",
      "Jackson County, Oregon, was awarded a $600,000 grant to replant trees after wildfires in 2020 destroyed thousands of homes and charred more than 60,000 trees. The town of Talent lost two-thirds of its trees.",
      "The nonprofit Oregon Urban Rural and Community Forestry, founded in the fires' aftermath, fought for years to get a single dollar, recalled Mike Oxendine, the group's founder and director.",
      "The grant money from the Arbor Day Foundation was being used to help low-income and disadvantaged mobile home park residents \u2014 among the hardest-hit by the fires \u2014 identify and remove hazardous trees badly burned or killed, and replant trees for shade and cooling.",
      "\u201cThis is a rural red area that needs it badly,\u201d said Oxendine. \u201cWe hit temperatures that exceed 110 degrees every summer now. We go through massive droughts and we\u2019re always prone to wildfire here.\u201d",
      "The loss of funding will create a \u201ctremendous burden\u201d for the organization, he said.",

      "The latest cases, confirmed by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Program, were detected in Sindh and Punjab provinces. This brings the total number of polio cases in Pakistan to five since January 2025. In 2024, Pakistan recorded 74 polio cases.",
      "The latest development comes as health workers conclude a targeted vaccination drive in high-risk areas later Friday. Earlier this month, authorities launched a weeklong nationwide anti-polio campaign aiming to immunize 44.2 million children under the age of five.",
      "Escorted by police, polio teams go door-to-door to administer the oral vaccine, though they are often attacked by militants who falsely claim that vaccination efforts are part of a Western plot to sterilize Muslim children. Since the 1990s, more than 200 polio workers and the police assigned to protect them have been killed in attacks."

      "Goff asked a question from the audience of the guest speaker, Finland\u2019s Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen, in which he said he had been re-reading a famous speech by former British wartime leader Winston Churchill from 1938, when Churchill was a lawmaker in the government of Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.",
      "Churchill's speech rebuked Britain's signing of the Munich Agreement with Adolf Hitler, allowing Germany to annex part of Czechoslovakia. Goff quoted Churchill as saying to Chamberlain, \u201cYou had the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor, yet you will have war.\u201d",
      "Goff then asked Valtonen: \u201cPresident Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?\u201d",
      "As the audience chuckled at the New Zealand envoy's question, Valtonen said she would \u201climit myself\u201d to saying that Churchill \u201chas made very timeless remarks,\u201d according to video of the event published by New Zealand news outlets.",
      "Valtonen's speech on Tuesday was billed as covering Finland\u2019s approach to European security at an event entitled \u2018Keeping the peace on NATO\u2019s longest border with Russia.\u2019",
      "In response to questions from reporters, Foreign Minister Winston Peters said that Goff\u2019s remarks were \u201cdisappointing\u201d and made the envoy\u2019s position \u201cuntenable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have asked the Secretary of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Bede Corry, to now work through with Mr. Goff the upcoming leadership transition at the New Zealand High Commission in London,\u201d Peters said in a written statement.",
      "Goff has been New Zealand\u2019s envoy to the U.K. since January 2023. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has praised the \u201csacrifice\u201d of British troops who were killed fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq",
      "LONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Wednesday praised the hundreds of British troops who died fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq \u201calongside our allies,\u201d in an oblique rebuke of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, who has questioned the merits of a potential European peacekeeping force in Ukraine following the signing of any peace agreement between the country and Russia.",
      "In his opening remarks before the start of a weekly parliamentary question session, Starmer specifically paid tribute to six British soldiers who died on patrol in Afghanistan when their vehicle was struck by an explosive. Thursday marks the 13-year anniversary of their deaths.",
      "\u201cThese men fought and died for their country, our country,\" Starmer told the House of Commons. \u201cAnd across the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, 642 individuals died fighting for Britain alongside our allies, many more were wounded.\u201d",
      "Without directly referencing Vance, the prime minister said he and all lawmakers will \u201cnever forget their bravery and their sacrifice.\u201d",
      "Vance said in an interview with Fox News this week that an economic pact with Kyiv sought by President Donald Trump \u201cis a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn\u2019t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.\u201d",
      "Though Vance has subsequently sought to head off criticism by noting that he did not specifically name any countries, his \u201crandom country\u201d comment prompted anger, particularly in the U.K. and France.",
      "British troops fought alongside the U.S. in Afghanistan and Iraq in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the U.S., while French troops were deployed to Afghanistan though not during the 2003 U.S.-led war in Iraq.",
      "Both Starmer, who has been careful not to criticize Trump over the past few days of frantic diplomacy, and French President Emmanuel Macron, have said that they are ready to deploy troops in a peacekeeping capacity in Ukraine after any peace deal, but have said that they would require further support from the U.S.",
      "No other countries have yet indicated they will be sending troops to any peacekeeping mission.",
      "Trump has offered no U.S. security guarantee and has, like Vance, indicated that an economic deal with Ukraine, that sees American money and people in the country but no forces, would be enough to fend off any future attack by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "In his overnight address to Congress, Trump appeared to soften his tone with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy following last Friday's fractious meeting in the Oval Office.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy had been expected to sign off on a minerals deal, intended in part to pay back the U.S. for aid it has sent Kyiv since the start of the war. But that plan was scrapped as the visit was ended abruptly after their meeting.",
      "Starmer said he is doing \u201ceverything he can\u201d to ensure the U.S. and Europe are \u201cworking together on lasting peace\u201d for Ukraine.",
      "Vance\u2019s interview with Fox News was recorded hours before a White House official confirmed on Monday evening that Trump had directed a pause of U.S. assistance to Ukraine as he seeks to Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war which Russia launched in Feb. 2022."

      "PANAMA CITY -- Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his address to Congress that his administration was \u201creclaiming\u201d the Panama Canal.",
      "Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Chinese group that operates ports at both ends of the Panama Canal.",
      "Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. \u201creclaiming\u201d of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.",
      "Mulino in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. \u201cI reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,\u201d he wrote. He accused Trump of \u201clying again.\u201d",
      "Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino in early February and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal\u2019s operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.",
      "\u201cCooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,\u201d Mulino wrote. \u201cIt doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.\"",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal has to be approved by Panama\u2019s government.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Trump has claimed that Carter \u201cfoolishly\u201d gave the canal away.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \u201cthe result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would like to stress that the transaction is purely commercial in nature and wholly unrelated to recent political news reports concerning the Panama Ports,\u201d Sixt said."

      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- China said Wednesday it will increase its defense budget 7.2% this year, as it continues its campaign to build a larger, more modern military to assert its territorial claims and challenge the U.S. defense lead in Asia.",
      "China\u2019s military spending remains the second largest behind the U.S. and it already has the world\u2019s largest navy.",
      "The budget, which adds up to about $245 billion, was announced at the National People\u2019s Congress, the annual meeting of China\u2019s legislature. The Pentagon and many experts say China's total spending on defense may be 40% higher or more because of items included under other budgets.",
      "The boost is the same percentage as last year, far below the double-digit percentage increases of previous years and reflecting an overall slowdown in the economy. The nation's leaders have set a target of around 5% growth for this year.",
      "Tensions with the U.S., Taiwan, Japan and neighbors who have overlapping claims to the crucial South China Sea are seen as driving spending on increasingly high-tech military technologies. Those include stealth fighters, the country's three \u2014 soon to be four \u2014 aircraft carriers, and a broad expansion of its nuclear arsenal.",
      "China generally ascribes the budget increases to exercises and maintenance and improving the lives of its 2 million service members.",
      "The People\u2019s Liberation Army \u2014 the military branch of the ruling Communist Party\u2014 has build bases on artificial islands in the South China Sea but its main objective is asserting Chinese control over Taiwan, a self-governing democracy Beijing claims as its own territory that has close ties to the U.S.",
      "China deployed a smaller contingent of five planes and seven ships near Taiwan on Wednesday, just days after sending dozens of aircraft. Such missions are intended to demoralize and wear down Taiwan's defenses, which have been bolstered by upgraded U.S. F-16s, tanks and missiles, along with domestically developed armaments.",
      "In his comments at the Congress, Premier Li Qiang told the nearly 3,000 party loyalists that China still preferred a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, but \u201cresolutely opposes\u201d those pushing for Taiwan's formal independence and their foreign supporters.",
      "\"We will firmly advance the cause of China\u2019s reunification and work with our fellow Chinese in Taiwan to realize the glorious cause of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\" Li said.",
      "Taiwan\u2019s defense minister this week said the island is planning to boost military spending in the face of the \u201crapidly changing international situation and the escalating threats from adversaries.\u201d",
      "Faced with slower growth, China will likely prioritize key strategic goals over social and economic reforms, said Antonia Hmaidi, a senior analyst with the Mercator Institute for China Studies.",
      "\"Those resources are more important to the CCP\u2019s goals of advancing a techno-industrial agenda and modernizing the military,\" Hmaidi said, using an acronym for the governing Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping, who oversees the armed forces, has attempted to force through major reforms and removed senior military leaders including two former defense ministers and the head of the missile corps.",
      "Whether that will reduce the armed forces' influence remains unclear though, and the official Xinhua News Agency ran an item after Wednesday's announcement praising the government for keeping defense spending at below 1.5% of GDP for the last decade and criticizing the U.S. for not cutting its spending.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s development strengthens the world\u2019s forces for peace, and the country will never seek hegemony or engage in expansionism no matter what stage of development it reaches,\u201d Xinhua said, using standard Chinese terms defining its stance as purely defensive in nature.",
      "In its 2004 report on military and security developments involving China, the U.S. Defense Department portrayed China's ever-growing ambitions, saying the \u201cPLA concepts and capabilities focus on projecting power far from China\u2019s shores.\u201d",
      "The navy's movement from offshore defense to open seas protection and the air force's interest in becoming a strategic force \"reflect the PLA\u2019s interest in conducting operations beyond (China) and its immediate periphery,\" the department said."

      "The decree enacted a decision by Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council to bolster Ukrainian defenses and seek more weapons from the country\u2019s Western allies.",

      "European Union leaders are holding emergency summit talks to beef up their own military defenses and make sure Ukraine will still be properly protected by its allies",
      "BRUSSELS -- Facing the possibility of a fundamental disengagement under U.S. President Donald Trump, European Union leaders opened a day of emergency summit talks Thursday to beef up their own military defenses and make sure that Ukraine will still be properly protected by its allies.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the likely next chancellor of Germany, was conferring with summit host Antonio Costa over breakfast on how to meet the challenge on a short deadline only days after he and his prospective coalition partner pushed plans to loosen the nation\u2019s rules on running up debt to allow for higher defense spending.",
      "At the same time, the 27-nation bloc was waking up to the news from French President Emmanuel Macron would confer with EU leaders the possibility of using France\u2019s nuclear deterrent to protect the continent from Russian threats.",
      "It all underscored the sea change that has happened in the two months since Trump took office and immediately started questioning the cornerstones of cooperation between the United States and Europe which had been the bedrock of Western security since World War II.",
      "\u201cGiven these profound shifts in US policy, and the existential threat of another war on the continent, Europe, must manage its essential defence tasks,\u201d the European Policy Center think tank said in a commentary.",
      "The bloc of 27 will \u201ctake decisive steps forward,\" Macron told the French nation Wednesday evening. \u201cMember states will be able to increase their military spending\u201d and \u201cmassive joint funding will be provided to buy and produce some of the most innovative munitions, tanks, weapons and equipment in Europe.\u201d",
      "Adding to the ebullient message he said that \u201cEurope\u2019s future does not have to be decided in Washington or Moscow.\u201d",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to be up to the task and has proposed an 800 billion euro ($840 billion) plan that would allow EU member states to spend much more on defense despite their current budgetary woes and profit from loans to kickstart the process.",
      "Part of any plan is also to protect the increasingly beleaguered position of Ukraine, and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to take part in the talks.",
      "Early this week, Trump ordered a pause to U.S. military supplies to Ukraine as he sought to press Zelenskyy to engage in negotiations to end the war with Russia, bringing fresh urgency to the EU summit in Brussels.",
      "\u201cEurope faces a clear and present danger on a scale that none of us have seen in our adult lifetime. Some of our fundamental assumptions are being undermined to their very core,\u201d European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in a letter to the EU\u2019s 27 leaders, who will consider ways to access more money for defense spending and ease restrictions on it.",
      "But perhaps the biggest challenge for the EU on Thursday will be to take a united stance at a moment when it\u2019s fractured, since much of what the bloc does requires unanimous support.",
      "Even if the challenges are so daunting, Thursday's summit is unlikely to produce immediate decisions on spending for Ukraine or its own defenses. Another EU summit where the real contours of decisions would be much clearer is set for March 20-21.",

      "Musk\u2019s Starlink internet satellite service, a subsidiary of SpaceX, has applied for a license to operate in Lesotho. It's one of several African countries where it is bidding to win contracts. The Lesotho Communications Authority said last month it recently received Starlink's bid for a 10-year license.",
      "Musk was born in South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho and its 2.3 million people.",
      "He met with Matekane on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Matekane posted a photo on X of them shaking hands. The message said in part: \u201cExciting developments lie ahead.\u201d",
      "Musk has been instrumental in the dismantling of the United States Agency for International Development in his role as head of the new Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Those cuts have threatened Lesotho\u2019s HIV program and forced it to lay off at least 1,500 health workers \u2014 about 7% of the country\u2019s health staff \u2014 in what the government has described as a severe blow. U.S. aid has been credited with helping Lesotho provide life-saving treatment to more than 200,000 people living with HIV.",
      "Lesotho has received American assistance for nearly 20 years through USAID, which gave it over $44 million last year. The dismantling of the agency and widespread terminations of U.S. foreign aid contracts have hit Africa harder than any other region.",
      "Lesotho's foreign minister, asked about Trump's comment on promoting LGBTQI+ in his country, said he was not aware of the $8 million contract Trump mentioned because USAID funding was largely channeled through non-governmental organizations. The minister didn\u2019t comment on the U.S. aid cuts.",
      "Lesotho repealed its laws against homosexuality in 2012 but same-sex marriages are still not recognized, and activists say LGBTQ people face stigma and discrimination.",

      "ASSISI, Italy -- As Pope Francis entered his third week in a hospital battling pneumonia, hundreds of pilgrims continued to make their way to this hilltop town to pray at the tomb of St. Francis, the hometown medieval saint whom the pontiff chose as his papal name.",
      "Groups from the United States, Ukraine and all over Italy made their way through a town of grey and brown stone houses that look little changed from when the saint was born here more than 840 years ago.",
      "They said they were inspired by St. Francis\u2019 love for the poor, peace and creation \u2014 all priorities for the pope, too, and the Franciscans, one of the largest orders in the Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cThe life of St. Francis teaches the way to holiness is giving up yourself, getting rid of things that hold us back in our life here, and just offer ourselves to the Lord,\u201d said the Rev. Paul Vu, who was visiting in early March with a group of 50 Vietnamese-American parishioners from Santa Ana, California.",
      "In 1182, Francis was born to a wealthy family in Assisi, which rises above a fertile valley in central Italy. Praying in front of a crucifix, he heard a call to reform the church. He aspired to strip everything down to the essentials in the service of God.",
      "The Santuario della Spogliazione, which literally means stripping, is a sober stone church on the hillside. It marks the spot where he gave up even his clothes in front of his father, who disinherited him. St. Francis was accepted into the church by the bishop as an advocate of the poor and went on to found a religious order that\u2019s still active globally today, the Franciscans.",
      "For Assisi\u2019s current bishop, the Rev. Domenico Sorrentino, St. Francis\u2019 renunciation of material encumbrances also signaled his love of creation and of peace.",
      "\u201cFrancis, stripping himself, came back to nature in some sense. So we must receive nature as a gift of God, and respect this gift,\u201d Sorrentino told The Associated Press.",
      "During the Crusades, St. Francis befriended a Muslim sultan \u2014 their exchanges are still seen as an example of the kind of interfaith dialogue that St. John Paul II promoted by gathering leaders of the major global religions in Assisi during his papacy.",
      "\u201cAssisi is the place to pray for peace in the world and inside of ourselves,\u201d said Elizabeth Nu\u00f1ez, a Passionist sister from Colombia who was there in pilgrimage on a recent weekend.",
      "After being elected, a pope chooses a name to adopt for his papacy. Jorge Mario Bergoglio picked Francis in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe explained it in a very simple way, that he chose Francis\u2019 name because he\u2019s the man of peace, of the poor, of brotherhood. The man who loves and respects creation,\u201d said the Rev. Enzo Fortunato, who spent 30 years in Assisi and now leads the Vatican\u2019s committee on World Children\u2019s Day. \u201cIt\u2019s a name that contains a life program.\u201d",
      "Several of the pope\u2019s encyclicals \u2014 teaching documents for the church \u2014 pulled from Franciscan themes and quotes, including one about building a more inclusive church.",

      "Pope Francis used its title for an encyclical highlighting the importance of taking care of the environment because it\u2019s a gift from God that humankind only gets to protect, not exploit.",
      "Dora Pell, a 75-year-old pilgrim from England, went walking in the woods around Assisi beloved by St. Francis and called it as moving as sitting by his tomb in the Basilica of St. Francis on the edge of town.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a spirituality that\u2019s based on love and inclusiveness,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s seeing Christ everywhere, in everything and everybody.\u201d",
      "The basilica contains a cycle of more than two dozen frescoes illustrating crucial moments in St. Francis\u2019 life \u2014 including the \u201cspogliazione.\u201d",
      "Painted by Giotto at the end of the 13th century, they marked a turning point in Western art. Their realism and careful rendering of space and depth went far beyond what was common in the Middle Ages and presaged the Renaissance.",
      "They were spared destruction in the 1997 earthquake that hit the region, killing four people in the basilica itself.",
      "Across town is the Basilica di Santa Chiara, dedicated to St. Clare, who embraced radical poverty to imitate St. Francis. He made available to her and the growing group of women following her a local church \u2014 the beginning of the Poor Clares order, now present in 70 countries with 20,000 sisters.",

      "A dolphin weighing more than 900 pounds appeared to fall out of the sky before landing in a small fishing boat off the coast of New Zealand, shocking the three men on board",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A placid fishing trip turned \u201cberserk\u201d for three New Zealand men when a dolphin weighing more than 400 kilograms (900 pounds) appeared to fall out of the sky before crash-landing in their small boat.",
      "No one was badly hurt when the 3.4 meter (11-foot) bottlenose dolphin jumped aboard the open-top boat Friday, said Dean Harrison, the owner of the nearly 16-foot vessel.",
      "Harrison and two companions were fishing near the Hole in the Rock, a picturesque spot off the far north coast of New Zealand\u2019s North Island, while dolphins frolicked ahead. The men saw a shadow across the bright summer sun and heard an almighty boom \u2014 before chaos unfolded.",
      "\u201cThis one decided to jump on board and say hello,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cOne minute everything was fine and then just like lightning striking, there\u2019s a big dolphin in our boat thrashing around and breaking everything.\"",
      "The creature\u2019s flailing snapped \u201cevery single fishing rod we had in the boat\u201d and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\u201cWe looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we\u2019ve got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cBecause he\u2019s stuck in the boat for now, so he\u2019s coming along for the ride.\u201d",
      "The men alerted New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2- 3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \u201csign\u201d in the M\u0101ori language.",
      "Tohu is now also the name of Dean Harrison's boat.",
      "\u201cThe dolphin got to swim away and we got to walk away and we've all got a story to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a good ending in a situation that could have been very different.\u201d"

      "L\u00f8kke added that it was important that next week\u2019s parliamentary elections are free and fair \u201cwithout any kind of international intervention.\u201d",
      "Greenlanders will head to the polls Tuesday. Trump's recent comments about taking over the island have ignited unprecedented interest in full independence from Denmark, which has become a key issue during campaign season."

      "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong's top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three former organizers of an annual vigil in remembrance of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown over their refusal to provide information to police, marking a rare victory for the city's pro-democracy activists.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong \u2014 core members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China \u2014 were convicted in 2023 during Beijing's crackdown on the city's pro-democracy movement. They received a sentence of 4 1/2 months and have already served their terms.",
      "The alliance was long known for organizing candlelight vigils in the city on the anniversary of the Chinese military\u2019s crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing. But it voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of a sweeping national security law imposed by China.",
      "Critics said the shutdown and the case showed that the city's Western-style civil liberties were shrinking despite promises they would be kept intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",

      "On Thursday, judges at the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled in the trio's favor. Chief Justice Andrew Cheung announced the decision in court.",

      "In their appeal, the appellants also took issue with crucial details that were redacted, including the names of groups that were alleged to have links with the alliance.",
      "The top court's judges ruled that by redacting the only potential evidential basis for establishing that the alliance was a foreign agent, the prosecution disabled itself from proving its case.",

      "\u201cJustice lives in people\u2019s hearts. Regardless of the outcome, everyone knows the truth in their hearts,\u201d he said.",
      "During an earlier hearing at the top court in January, Chow, who represented herself and prepared the appeal in prison, said her case highlighted what a police state is.",
      "\u201cA police state is created by the complicity of the court in endorsing such abuses. This kind of complicity must stop now,\" she said.",
      "Since the security law was introduced in 2020, several non-permanent overseas judges have quit the top court, raising questions over confidence in the city\u2019s judicial system. In 2024, Jonathan Sumption quit his position and said the rule of law was profoundly compromised.",
      "But Cheung in January said the judges' premature departures did not mean the judiciary's independence was weakening.",
      "The annual vigil at Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park was the only large-scale public commemoration of the June 4 crackdown on Chinese soil for decades. Thousands attended it annually until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.",
      "After COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, the park was occupied instead by a carnival organized by pro-Beijing groups. Those who tried to commemorate the event near the site were detained.",
      "Chow and two other former alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, were charged with subversion in a separate case under the security law. They remain in custody, awaiting the beginning of their trial.",
      "In a separate ruling on Thursday, judges at the top court dismissed jailed pro-democracy activist Tam Tak-chi\u2019s bid to overturn his sedition convictions in a landmark case brought under a colonial-era law that was used to crush dissent.",
      "Tam Tak-chi was the first person tried under the sedition law since the 1997 handover and was found guilty of 11 charges in 2022, including seven counts of \u201cuttering seditious words.\u201d The judges ruled that the prosecution was not required to establish that the words uttered by the appellant were intended to incite violence or public disorder.",
      "The colonial-era law was repealed last year after the government introduced a new, home-grown security law that it said was necessary for stability. Critics worry the law will further curtail freedoms."

      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Stella McCartney \u2019s star-studded fall show was a bold statement on power, sensuality, and self-possession. Set inside the \u2018Stella Corp\u2019 offices in northern Paris, the runway blurred the lines between boardroom and nightlife, business and pleasure.",
      "The Paris collection, provocatively titled \u201cLaptop to Lapdance,\u201d explored the modern working woman\u2019s ability to shift seamlessly between roles, embracing both structure and seduction. It was a natural evolution of 1980s power dressing, when broad-shouldered tailoring became the armor of ambition.",
      "Cameron Diaz, Jeff Koons, Olivia Colman, Kate Moss, Richard E. Grant, and French First Lady Brigitte Macron gathered around desks and buzzing PCs, sipping from water fountains. Possibly the starriest front row of the season, the guest list embodied the high-wattage allure of Paris Fashion Week.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so bowled over to be here to support Stella. I\u2019ve been coming to Paris since I was 19,\u201d Diaz told The Associated Press.",
      "McCartney staged her show inside a fully realized corporate office space, complete with whirring PCs, water coolers, and notepads placed on every seat\u2014a detail that made the setting feel lived-in rather than just conceptual. The show\u2019s workplace theme was taken to the extreme with actual pole dancers performing inside the space, sending fashion insiders reaching for their cameras, and even had Moss turning snapping her head to the side to get a better look.",
      "McCartney\u2019s take on power dressing blended structure with sensuality. Double-breasted gray jackets, oversized and slightly slouched, were worn against bare skin, reworking suiting into something more subversive. Strong 1980s shoulders projected authority, while low-slung trousers introduced a relaxed, almost undone contrast. The interplay between sharp tailoring and fluid movement defined the collection, with sculptural draping and cinched waists disrupting the rigidity of oversized coats and menswear-inspired pieces.",
      "McCartney leaned into the fantasy of the office as a space for transformation and play, where power is redefined and reclaimed. Glossy, PVC-like vegan stripper boots injected overt sex appeal, while accessories heightened the contrasts\u2014studious glasses with exaggerated faux fur coats, chaps dripping with chains nodding to equestrian heritage and McCartney\u2019s signature Falabella bag.",
      "The collection was a study in contrasts\u2014masculine and feminine, professional and personal, control and abandon. Models wove between desks, reinforcing McCartney\u2019s belief that a woman shouldn\u2019t have to choose between power and pleasure. The setting emphasized fluidity, how a wardrobe must shift throughout the day, adapting to different versions of the same woman.",
      "McCartney\u2019s commitment to sustainability remained central, with 96% of the collection crafted from conscious materials. Innovations like recycled silk, organic cotton, and forest-friendly viscose underscored her mission to prove that desirability and ethics are not mutually exclusive.",
      "McCartney, who recently bought back the share LVMH held in her company, called this collection her first truly independent vision since college. \u201cI was looking at what I do, knowing this is my first show ever alone, other than when I left college,\u201d she said.",
      "She highlighted the house\u2019s emphasis on dressing for day-to-night. \u201cThe date-night thing is really important for my brand because, I think, I want to be women\u2019s friends and I want them to rely on me,\u201d she said. \u201cI want them to wear that suit out to a club.\u201d",
      "The boots embodied the collection\u2019s blend of confidence and playfulness. \u201cThose boots - they grip onto a pole. I think they just do the work for you,\u201d McCartney said, laughing. Asked about the fetishistic undertones, she shrugged. \u201cYou said it, not me! I mean, Jesus, it\u2019s all legal as far as I last checked.\u201d",
      "Amid the playful energy, she acknowledged the industry\u2019s demands. \u201cWe all work really, really, really, really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, from when I started to now, it\u2019s like, wow, this is a very different industry. And I wanted to kind of celebrate how hard everyone works too.\u201d",
      "Before the night was over, she encouraged guests to take a piece of the office set home. \u201cI hope you all took the staplers and the mugs,\u201d she joked. \u201cWe need those pens.\u201d"

      "He was cleared of two further counts of possession of an extreme pornographic image and one of possession of MDMA with intent to commit a sexual offense.",

      "\u201cHe has done all that he can in these offenses to incapacitate his victims to the point where they could not resist his attack, and in many instances may not even remember what has occurred to them,\u201d said Metropolitan Police Commander Kevin Southworth.",
      "He thanked the two women who testified against the \u201cparticularly cowardly and deceitful\u201d Zou and said there is evidence that he \"may have potentially attacked as many as 50 other women in the same awful nature.\u201d",
      "The Met is appealing to anyone who thinks they may have been targeted by Zou to contact the force.",
      "During the trial, a call to police from one of the women led to questions over the quality of the interpreter made available.",

Trump also said he told the automaker chief executives that they should move production to the U.S from Canada and Mexico, according to White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.",
      "\u201cWe spoke with the big three auto dealers,\u201d Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \u201cWe are going to give a one month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\u201d referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.\"",
      "Trump's press secretary said the president is open to hearing about additional exemptions but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is not willing to lift Canada\u2019s retaliatory tariffs if Trump leaves any tariffs on Canada, a senior government official told The Associated Press. The official confirmed the stance on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.",
      "\"\u201cBoth countries will continue to be in contact today,\u201d Trudeau\u2019s office said.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford earlier told The Associated Press the auto sector in the U.S. and Canada would last approximately 10 days before they start shutting down the assembly lines in the U.S. and in Ontario.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to lose their jobs,\u201d he said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick earlier said there might be carveouts coming to the 25% tariffs placed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "But, Trump's tariffs have stirred up bad blood among allies who see his aggression on trade as misguided, with Canada suggesting it will reject any offer to water down the day-old tariffs. The trade war is not necessarily a brief skirmish as the White House maintains that even harsher taxes on imports are coming in April, even as businesses and consumers worry that rising costs will crush economic growth, worsen inflation and result in layoffs.",
      "Still, the administration is grappling with the fallout of tariff that could create serious blowback for his political mandate to lower prices. Trump has acknowledged that his tariffs could cause some financial pain, yet he has repeatedly said the tariffs will lead to more domestic investment and factory work.",
      "In a Wednesday interview with Bloomberg Television, Lutnick said that Trump would update his tariff plans with an afternoon announcement, possibly sparing sectors such as autos from the import taxes.",
      "On April 2, Trump plans to announce what he calls \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs to match the tariffs, taxes and subsidies provided by other countries. That could dramatically increase the tariff rates charged globally while maintaining the risk of a broader tariff.",
      "Lutnick said he would talk on Wednesday morning with Trump about the possible options regarding Canada and Mexico, saying that both countries are working to address the U.S. president's concerns about drug trafficking. Lutnick said to expect Trump to announce his decision Wednesday afternoon.",
      "On Tuesday, Trump put 25% taxes on imports from Mexico and Canada, taxing Canadian energy products such as oil and electricity at a lower 10% rate. The president also doubled the 10% tariff he placed on China to 20%. The administration has said the tariffs are about stopping the smuggling of drugs such as fentanyl, but Trump also suggested that the tariffs are about getting rid of persistent U.S. trade deficits.",
      "The taxes almost immediately triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday. The U.S. stock market has given up all of the gains since Trump's victory in last year's presidential election and consumers are already exhausted by inflation and worried the costs of the tax hike would lead to higher prices. Those concerns may have prompted Lutnick to signal a possible retreat in a Tuesday afternoon interview with the Fox Business Network.",
      "The U.S. president tried to play down the possible economic harm as \u201ca little disturbance,\u201d as the administration has suggested that the estimates of higher inflation and slower growth in most outside economic forecasts are overblown.",
      "\u201cIt may be a little bit of an adjustment period,\u201d he said after claiming that farmers would benefit from reciprocal tariffs on countries that have tariffs on U.S. exports. \u201cYou have to bear with me again and this will be even better.\u201d",
      "Trump also said in his speech that he spoke on Tuesday with \u201call three, the top people\u201d at the major U.S. automakers and \u201cthey're so excited.\u201d The big three automakers are General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep. The domestic auto sector would be especially vulnerable to tariffs as it depends on Mexico and Canada as part of its supply chains.",
      "Trudeau said on Tuesday that his country would plaster tariffs on over $100 billion (U.S. dollars) of American goods over the course of 21 days, stressing that the United States had abandoned a long-standing friendship.",
      "\u201cToday, the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they are talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying, murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\u201d Trudeau said on Tuesday.",
      "Mexico indicated it would announce its own countermeasures on Sunday.",
      "Beijing responded with tariffs of up to 15% on a wide array of U.S. farm exports. It also expanded the number of U.S. companies subject to export controls and other restrictions by about two dozen.",
      "\u201cIf war is what the U.S. wants, be it a tariff war, a trade war or any other type of war, we\u2019re ready to fight till the end,\u201d China\u2019s embassy to the United States posted on X on Tuesday night.",
      "In response to China, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told Fox News Channel\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that the United States is \u201cprepared\u201d for war against the world's second largest economy.",
      "\u201cThose who long for peace must prepare for war,\u201d Hegseth said Wednesday morning. \"If we want to deter war with the Chinese or others, we have to be strong.\"",
      "Leavitt is one of three administration officials who face a lawsuit from The Associated Press on First- and Fifth-amendment grounds. The AP says the three are punishing the news agency for editorial decisions they oppose. The White House says the AP is not following an executive order to refer to the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America.",

      "China is keeping its economic growth target at \u201caround 5%\u201d for 2025 despite a looming trade war with the United States and other headwinds",
      "BEIJING -- The Chinese government unveiled an annual economic growth target of \u201caround 5%\u201d on Wednesday, despite the possible negative impact of a looming trade war with the United States, and pledged to address what it called \u201csluggish\u201d consumer spending at home.",
      "The target was announced at the opening session of the annual meeting of China's legislature. It's the same as for the last two years but will likely be more difficult to achieve because of the new, higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese products and other economic headwinds. The use of \u201caround\u201d gives the government some room if growth falls short.",
      "The target signals the government's intention to try to stabilize growth in challenging economic times but hold back on more dramatic action that some economists say is needed to supercharge it.",
      "The government also said in a draft budget released Wednesday that defense spending would rise 7.2% this year to 1.78 trillion yuan ($245 billion), second only to the United States.",
      "It released the growth target in a separate report, parts of which were presented to the nearly 3,000 members of the National People's Congress by Premier Li Qiang. It acknowledged both international and domestic challenges.",
      "\u201cAn increasingly complex and severe external environment may exert a greater impact on China in areas such as trade, science, and technology,\u201d the report said, without specifics. \u201cUnilateralism and protectionism are on the rise.\u201d",
      "It added: \u201cDomestically, the foundation for China\u2019s sustained economic recovery and growth is not strong enough. Effective demand is weak, and consumption, in particular, is sluggish.\u201d",
      "The International Monetary Fund has projected that China's economy will grow 4.6% this year, down from 5% in 2024, according to Chinese government statistics.",
      "The new report placed more emphasis on reviving domestic demand and consumption than last year's, echoing a shift by the ruling Communist Party at meetings in December. It said the government should \u201cmake domestic demand the main engine and anchor of economic growth.\u201d",
      "The report added that \u201cachieving this year's targets will not be easy, and we must make arduous efforts to meet them.\u201d",
      "Across-the-board 20% tariffs imposed this week on Chinese products by U.S. President Donald Trump pose the latest threat to an economy already weighed down by a prolonged real estate slump and sluggish consumer spending and private business investment. The tariffs could crimp sales to one of China\u2019s major export markets, making the need to boost domestic demand more urgent.",
      "The new report offered some details on the party's plans for a \u201cmore proactive fiscal policy,\u201d including a rise in the government budget deficit from 3% to 4% of GDP, or the size of the overall economy. It also reiterated the party\u2019s announcement in December that the central bank would shift its monetary policy from \u201cprudent\u201d to \u201cmoderately loose\u201d for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "The government will issue 1.3 trillion yuan ($180 billion) in ultra-long term bonds, up from 1 trillion yuan last year, the report said. Of that, 300 billion yuan would go toward a program launched last year that offers rebates to consumers who trade in automobiles or appliances for new ones, doubling central government support for the program.",
      "Economists expressed doubts over whether the policies will do enough, noting that the government reduced its inflation target to 2% from 3% last year, and suggesting leaders have accepted that the economy is still mired in deflation, or a cycle of weakening prices.",
      "The degree of support is \u201cmore modest than it may appear,\u201d Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics said in a report. \u201cWe remain skeptical that it will be sufficient to prevent growth from slowing this year, especially given the headwinds on the external front and the lack of a more pronounced shift in government spending toward support for consumption.\u201d",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also wants to wean the economy off its long-running dependence on the highly indebted real estate market.",
      "He is directing economic resources into developing a more innovative, high-tech economy \u2014 and with growing restrictions on U.S. technology exports to China, one that isn't beholden to other countries for the most powerful semiconductors and other electronic components.",
      "Xi told delegates from Jiangsu province, one of China's wealthier coastal provinces known for exports, on Wednesday that \u201ctechnological innovation and industrial innovation are the basic paths to developing new quality productivity.\u201d",

      "The push towards developing a high-tech economy has been a long-term economic goal of the Communist Party, though it has enacted measures since September that suggest a shift in emphasis toward shoring up growth in the short term.",

      "The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to significantly loosen the country\u2019s constitutional restriction on deficits, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in new borrowing and spending on defense ...",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- The two political parties expected to form the next German government have agreed to loosen the country's constitution restrictions on borrowing, enabling 1 trillion euros ($1.08 trillion) or more in spending on defense and infrastructure.",
      "It\u2019s a major change in Germany\u2019s debt-averse political culture, rejecting conventional economic wisdom that long dominated Europe\u2019s biggest economy and one of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries.",
      "Here are key facts about the debt brake and what the changes will mean for Germany and Europe.",
      "The debt brake was passed in 2009, when a global financial crisis led to sharp increase in government borrowing in Germany and around the world. The debt brake also reflected cultural and political skepticism about debt in general that for years left a deep imprint on German politics.",
      "The debt brake limited new borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product - a tight limit when compared to European Union budget rules requiring less than 3%, and the 2024 U.S. federal deficit of 6.4%.",
      "The debt brake appeared to work fine for years - until it didn't. German governments lived within the limits during the good times in the 2010s, often running small surpluses.",
      "But the pandemic, slowing growth and Russia's invasion of Ukraine put the debt brake under severe strain.",
      "The government had to invoke an emergency clause to borrow and spend more on pandemic relief for businesses in 2020. Then it declared another emergency in 2021, and another one in 2022 after Russia's invasion of Ukraine raised pressure for more defense spending and relief for utility customers. Yet another emergency exemption was used in 2023. However in late 2023 the Federal Constitutional Court ruled the government had gone too far in fudging the debt limit, forcing a frantic rewrite of the 2024 budget.",
      "Then Social Democrat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government collapsed in November 2024 over disagreement with a coalition party, the pro-business Free Democrats, over spending and the debt brake.",
      "The reformed debt brake would remove the constitutional ceiling when it comes to defense spending. That would support efforts to build up Germany\u2019s own defenses and its ability to further support Ukraine. Germany is already a leading backer of Ukraine, sending 60 Leopard tanks and 175 Marder infantry fighting vehicles as well as 27 air defense systems, including three of its U.S.-made Patriot missile batteries.",
      "\u201cThe extra room for defence spending sends a clear signal to Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump as well as to Germany\u2019s European friends that Germany is serious about defending itself and helping Ukraine,\u201d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg bank.",
      "\u201cGermany is finally taking on the leadership role which, given its size and its fiscal space, it should have assumed years ago.\u201d",
      "Leaders of the conservative Union bloc agreed with the center-left Social Democrats to exempt military spending over 1% of GDP from the debt limit, as well as a 500 billion euro infrastructure fund for civil and disaster protection, transport infrastructure, hospitals, energy infrastructure, education, scientific research and digitization. Economists estimate that the measure, if passed, could enable a trillion euros in new borrowing and spending over a decade.",
      "The agreement came during talks aimed at forming a coalition government between the two parties.",
      "It was a sharp turnaround for Friedrich Merz, who as Union leader is the likely next chancellor after his party came in first in national elections on Feb. 23. His party program rejected changes to the debt brake, though he had indicated he might be open to negotiation on that point.",
      "The move \u201cfollows the old political principle: if the facts change, I change my mind,\u201d said Carsten Brzeski, global chief of macro at ING bank.",
      "The agreement reflects both long-term strains on the debt brake, and the sudden recent shift in U.S. security policy under U.S. President Donald Trump, who has demanded that Europe do more for own security, disrupting the post-World War II transatlantic alliance under which Europe looked to the U.S. as an ultimate security guarantor.",
      "Trump's public disparagement of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office and decision to suspend military aid to Ukraine have shocked European governments into facing the need for vastly more defense spending to fill the gap left by a U.S. seen as no longer committed to Europe's security.",
      "Germany only met the NATO requirement to spend 2% of GDP on defense through a 100 billion-euro special fund exempted from the debt brake in 2022 - but that fund will run out in 2027.",
      "The parties plan to rush the changes through the lame duck parliament next week. That's because mainstream parties have the needed two-thirds majority in the old parliament - but will lose that in the new parliament due to electoral gains by the far-right Alternative for Germany and the far-left The Left party who oppose the changes.",
      "The measure would still need votes in the outgoing parliament from the environmentalist Greens, who weren't part of the coalition talks.",
      "Economists say the looser debt brake could help Germany emerge from five years of economic stagnation by increasing spending on things that promote economic activity over the long term. Skimping on infrastructure spending has been blamed for trains that don't run on time due to endless track repairs, crumbling bridges, declining educational achievement levels, and lagging adoption of renewable energy infrastructure and digital technology.",
      "The morning after the announcement, economists started tearing up old growth forecasts and raising their outlook. Morgan Stanley saw the possibility of 0.2% more GDP growth this year and 0.7% more next year. That would be welcome in an economy that shrank for the past two years.",
      "\u201cEverything you thought you knew about Germany\u2019s economic prospects three months ago, or even three weeks ago, should be ripped up,\u201d said Jim Reid, research strategist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThis is game-changing if it goes through.\u201d",
      "The step is a \u201csea change\u201d in German policy, said economist Schmieding.",
      "\u201cThe infrastructure fund signals that the new government will seriously tackle key domestic deficiencies,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cI look forward to the day in the \u2013 probably still somewhat distant \u2013 future when German trains may run as fast and punctual as those in France, Switzerland or Austria.\u201d"

      "Since taking office six weeks ago, Trump has repeatedly expressed his interest in Greenland, a huge mineral-rich island that sits along strategic sea lanes in the North Atlantic. Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark with a population of about 56,000 people, lies off the northeastern coast of Canada, closer to Washington, D.C., than to Copenhagen.",
      "Trump made a direct appeal to Greenlanders in his speech to Congress, just a week before the country\u2019s voters cast their ballots in parliamentary elections.",

      "But Trump\u2019s message came with undertones of the great power politics that have marked the early days of his second administration. Since taking office, Trump has suggested moving Palestinians out of the Gaza Strip and turning it into a \u201cRiviera of the Middle East;\u201d announced his intention to regain control of the Panama Canal; and stopped arms deliveries to Ukraine after the country\u2019s president was slow to endorse Washington\u2019s roadmap for a peace deal with Russia.",

      "\u201cWe feel like it\u2019s a bad idea, and we just more want to be like our little island that\u2019s more independent than anything else,\u201d Aardestrup said.",
      "\u201cGreenland is very independent,\u201d she added.",
      "Aardestrup is also worried about importing the school shootings, angry politics and homelessness that dominate the news from the U.S. She fears that would threaten Greenland\u2019s culture, which she learned about from the stories her parents told her.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great people here,\u201d she said. \u201cLike, you create very lovely and longstanding friendships. And I think that\u2019s what I love about Greenland so much.\u201d",
      "Greenlanders voted overwhelmingly in favor of self-government in a 2009 referendum that also established a pathway to independence whenever the people of the island support such a move. Under the terms of that referendum, Denmark remains responsible for Greenland\u2019s defense and foreign affairs, with the local government controlling other matters.",

      "Some retailers are beginning to take a more cautious approach with their financial forecasts as they keep a closer eye on signs of a pullback in consumer spending",
      "A pullback by American shoppers has led to more caution from national retailers about their sales potential in 2025, Abercrombie & Fitch on Wednesday becoming the latest.",
      "U.S. consumer confidence plunged last month, the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, according to the Conference Board. Respondents to the board\u2019s survey expressed concern over inflation with a significant increase in mentions of trade and tariffs, the board said.",
      "The imposition of new tariffs this week by President Donald Trump against America\u2019s three biggest trading partners drew immediate retaliation from Mexico, Canada and China, sending financial markets into a tailspin. Tariffs threaten to rekindle inflation, which in recent weeks appears to have begun to tick higher and has created more uncertainty for families and businesses.",
      "Trump imposed 25% taxes, or tariffs, on Mexican and Canadian imports, though he limited the levy to 10% on Canadian energy. Trump also doubled the tariff he slapped last month on Chinese products to 20%.",
      "On Wednesday when reporting its most recent quarterly performance, Abercrombie & Fitch said it expects sales growth of between 3% and 5% in 2025, worse than Wall Street had been expecting and far below the sales growth of 16% that the retailer achieved last year.",
      "Shares slid more than 14% Wednesday and they're down almost 46% this year.",
      "The retail landscape is becoming more challenging, Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, wrote Wednesday. Yet he also noted that Abercrombie had a very good 2024, making it more difficult to match in 2025.",
      "\u201cIt is reasonable to expect some moderation in the growth rate \u2013 as is reflected in the company outlook,\u201d Saunders said.",
      "Abercrombie & Fitch, however, joins a growing list of retailers that see a slowdown ahead, and not all of those companies had a banner year in 2024.",
      "Sales and profits slipped for Target last year and the retailer said this week that there will be \u201d meaningful pressure \u201d on its profits to start 2025 because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, in addition to other costs. Even before the trade war heated up this week, Target reported falling profits and sales in the crucial period leading up to the year-end holidays, with more customers pausing before breaking out the wallet.",
      "Target CEO Brian Cornell said Tuesday that Americans could see prices for food begin to rise in just a few days, particularly produce from Mexico such as avocados. Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday the country will respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the United States with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, with details to come.",
      "While Cornell declined to talk specifically about potential price hikes shoppers might see on Target shelves, he warned that there will be price increases for some products.",
      "Target shares are down almost 15% this year and specialty retailers that have seen stock gains are in the minority. Shares of Gap are down 15% this year and shares of American Eagle, Guess and Zumiez are all down about 29%.",
      "Walmart, like Abercrombie & Fitch, thrived in 2024 but sees a potentially rougher path forward.",
      "Late last month, the nation's largest retailer said its per-share earnings for this year could be as much as 27 cents below Wall Street expectations. The company expects annual sales to rise 3% or 4% to between $667.57 billion and $674.05 billion. That also caught Wall Street off guard, where 2025 sales projections had been closer to $708 billion."

    "story": [
      "Electric vehicle shoppers could be thrown a couple of curve balls in 2025 if the Trump administration goes through with some of its plans",
      "Car shoppers considering buying an electric vehicle in 2025 will have more factors to consider than buyers in previous years. Most of it is good news. For instance, automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs and improve their current models. Expanded charging options and very attractive used EV prices are also hot topics for this year. But there are also negative trends you need to watch out for. Edmunds\u2019 auto experts break down what you can expect before heading out and buying an EV for 2025.",
      "According to the NPR article \u201d Here\u2019s how Trump\u2019s tariffs could impact you and your wallet,\u201d the price for certain imported electric vehicles will increase with the Trump administration tariffs. Tariffs on other components or materials used for vehicle manufacturing will also have an impact. Estimates vary widely on how much extra you might have to pay should these tariffs be in effect for a long duration, but it could potentially be thousands of dollars depending on the vehicle.",
      "The new administration has also said it would repeal the federal EV tax credit of $7,500 for new EVs and $4,000 for used EVs. Right now, certain new EVs qualify for a $7,500 tax credit, which can be put toward the sales price with a purchase or lease or toward your tax liability if you purchase it. Used EVs priced under $25,000 can qualify for a tax credit of up to $4,000.",
      "Tesla charging stations, which used to be available to Tesla vehicles only, are now open to most non-Tesla EVs. This expansion includes Tesla\u2019s vast network of fast-charging stations called Supercharger stations, and it\u2019s a big deal because it significantly increases the number of charging stations EV owners can use. Public charging stations from various third-party companies like EVgo and Electrify America were the only options for non-Tesla EVs in the past. Tesla\u2019s network of charging stations is nationwide and the largest in the country. The stations are also very reliable and are rarely offline.",
      "Tesla stations can be easy to use once everything is set up. But you need to check with your vehicle\u2019s manufacturer to find out how to use a Tesla charging station and likely buy or obtain a charging connector adaptor.",
      "EV shoppers have plenty of choices in 2025, and most of these models offer plenty of range. Many vehicles, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Hyundai Ioniq 5, provide over 300 miles of range on certain models. Some high-dollar EVs from Mercedes-Benz and Lucid and electric trucks from GM easily exceeded the 400-mile mark when Edmunds tested them.",
      "EVs are also becoming more affordable; a few have starting prices below $35,000 even without the federal tax credit, including the Chevrolet Equinox EV and Hyundai Kona Electric. For the lowest monthly payments, consider leasing an EV. Automakers offer great lease deals during certain months thanks to big incentives and the tax credit.",
      "Even with federal tax credits, a new EV is typically more expensive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle. But the resale value of EVs \u2014 essentially, how much they are worth a few years after purchase \u2014 is dropping quicker than those for gas-powered vehicles. That\u2019s great news if you\u2019re in the market for a used EV. For example, 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E GTs that cost more than $60,000 when new are now selling in the low $30,000s.",
      "However, this big drop in value isn\u2019t so great if you\u2019re the one trying to sell or trade in your used EV. You\u2019ll likely be surprised and dismayed that your vehicle is worth substantially less than what you bought it for. It\u2019s especially bad if you owe a significant amount of money on your loan. It\u2019s possible you could owe more on your loan than what the vehicle is actually worth.",
      "If you\u2019re planning on buying an EV this year, it\u2019s best to do it soon in case EV tax credits are repealed and in case prices increase. If you do purchase one, find out how to get access to Tesla charging stations because they are far easier to use than the various third-party stations.",

      "Vendors are a fixture at Rio\u2019s Carnival street parties",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Sweat streamed down Talita Ferreira Sanches\u2019 face as she pushed a cart loaded with beer and water up the winding, cobblestone streets in Rio de Janeiro last month, calling out to glitter-covered revelers decked out in fishnet tights.",
      "The 22-year-old from an area outside Rio had spent the night sleeping on a street in bohemian neighborhood Santa Teresa, covering herself with just a sheet, so she could arrive in time for the early-morning Carnival party \u201cHeaven on Earth\u201d.",
      "\u201cCarnival represents a lot of joy and all the money that we make,\u201d said Ferreira Sanches, who has worked as a street vendor for the last four years. She makes around 1,500 reais ($260) a day during Carnival \u2014 about the same as the country's monthly minimum wage.",
      "\u201cEvery year, we have an objective. Last year we bought a fridge and a television, this year we want to buy a wardrobe and a stove,\u201d she said, pocketing cash with one hand while dishing out ice-cold drinks with the other.",
      "Like musicians and stilt walkers, vendors are a fixture at Rio's street parties. Known in Portuguese as \u201cambulantes\u201d or \u201ccamelos,\" they scour Instagram pages for times and locations, coordinate on WhatsApp groups, then race across parks and up hills, from Rio\u2019s downtown to Copacabana beach, all to place themselves and their carts in the thronging crush of thousands \u2014 or hundreds of thousands \u2014 of thirsty revelers.",
      "Peddlers provide much-needed party fuel and hydration, and can themselves partake in the buzzing, joyous atmosphere. More than that, though, it's an economic lifeline, allowing them to pay off debts, buy presents for their kids and set them up for the rest of the year.",
      "But as opportunity to cash in has grown, more and more vendors have joined the rush \u2014 and drawn pushback. There are nearly 500 registered street parties this year, and hundreds more unofficial ones, considerably more than the pre-pandemic era, and they all need cold beer and water.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall conducted a lottery for 15,000 authorized vendors at this year\u2019s Carnival \u2014 5,000 more than last year, but observers say there are far more vendors than spots.",
      "Selling without a permit renders them vulnerable to harassment, seizure of their merchandise and even violence from Rio\u2019s municipal guard, according to the United Street Vendors' Movement \u2014 known by its acronym MUCA.",
      "The ballooning number of vendors in recent years has created tensions with party organizers, said Pericles Monteiro, the director of Heaven on Earth, which he founded in 2001. Party facilitators and revelers have accused hawkers of blockading the procession by setting up shop in the middle of its path with their heavy carts.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t walk, we felt suffocated,\u201d Monteiro said of Heaven on Earth's procession two years ago. The group didn\u2019t get to the square where the show was supposed to end on time, and had to walk almost in silence until reaching the designated area. When they got there, peddlers had barbecues fired up and vans parked in the street, leaving little room for performers, musicians or revelers.",
      "\u201cWe support street vendors. People have to work and they have an important role. We are aware of that. But the way it has been done, the intensity \u2014 there really has been a serious problem hindering the party\u2019s development,\u201d Monteiro added.",
      "Vendors are aware of the grievances, and the impact on their reputation. This year, union SindInformal and other groups launched a campaign to promote respect, proper organization and security during Carnival, and recommended buying from vendors surrounding the party rather than in the middle of the mayhem.",
      "Fear of repercussions and clashes also prompted MUCA to produce a manifesto this year calling for \u201cmess with harmony.\u201d The document said criticism and attacks targeting vendors spark backlash against an already marginalized community.",
      "\u201cVendors are seen as dangerous, as tarnishing the city\u2019s reputation, as causing public disorder,\u201d said Fl\u00e1via Magalh\u00e3es, who researches street sellers at the Paulista University in Sao Paulo. \u201cBut vendors sustain a festive street culture that is very important for the city\u2019s tourism.\u201d",
      "They also face dire working conditions, struggling to access toilets, working long hours without stopping for food and struggling to find a legal place to leave their merchandise, according to a 2019 report by MUCA and Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. They often spend hours on public transport each day trekking into the city from the poor periphery.",
      "During Carnival, being based in the city center is a game-changer, said Maria de Lourdes do Carmo, 50, known as Maria of the Street Vendors.",
      "Do Carmo has been a vendor for three decades, often hawking caipirinhas to foreign tourists in Santa Teresa's cobblestone hills; the municipal guard doesn't tend to crackdown up there, she said. She ran for a city council seat in last year\u2019s election to fight for greater respect for her peers, but lost.",
      "Since last year, Rio state's public prosecutors have been leading discussions on preventing violence against itinerant workers while also trying to tackle the municipality's failure to better organize their activity, for example by providing sanctioned deposits for their goods.",
      "And City Hall this year is attending to a long-standing demand for childcare services. Authorities will provide a daycare center for vendors\u2019 children during street parties and samba schools\u2019 parades, with food, cultural activities and games, Rio\u2019s department of social assistance said in an email.",
      "For D\u00e9bora Silva Pereira, 42, enduring the long, exhausting days away from her family is worth it, firstly because Carnival buoys her family's income. On a good day, she makes 3,000 reais \u2014 what she normally earns in 10 days during the rest of the year, selling women's clothing. But she also enjoys the mixture of work and play.",
      "\u201cWe meet people and make friends. The money makes it worth it, but experiences even more so,\u201d she said."

      "Chinese manufacturers reported stronger orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs",
      "BANGKOK -- Chinese manufacturers reported an uptick in orders in February as importers rushed to beat higher U.S. tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump, as a Chinese state media report said that Beijing was considering ways to retaliate.",
      "Trump earlier imposed a tariff of 10% on imports from China and that will rise to 20% beginning Tuesday. He also ended the \u201cde minimis\u201d loophole that exempted imports worth less than $800 from tariffs, in a blow to companies whose online sales direct to consumers had soared in recent years.",
      "The Global Times, a newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Monday that Beijing was studying both tariffs and non-tariff moves to counter Trump's higher tariffs. Asked about that report, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said that \u201cChina will take all necessary measures to firmly safeguard own legitimate rights and interests.\u201d",
      "\u201cU.S. agricultural and food products will most likely be listed,\u201d it said, citing an unnamed source. Last week, Chinese Commerce Ministry officials had said the two sides were in a \u201cdialogue\u201d about trade.",
      "The stronger-than-expected data came as Chinese leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress. Lawmakers are expected as usual to endorse policies and priorities set by the ruling Communist Party, which could include some fresh help for the economy as it slows to annual growth many economists forecast will fall to about 4.5% this year.",
      "Surveys of factory managers showed China\u2019s official purchasing managers index rose to 50.2% from 49% in January, though that was just above the 50 level that marks the break between contraction and expansion. The new orders index rose to 51.1.",
      "Steady industrial production suggests that government spending and \u201cfront running\u201d to beat the higher tariffs supported stronger business activity last month, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cBut growth still looks at risk of slowing this quarter, at least partially reversing the pick-up in Q4 (October-December). And that\u2019s before the hit from tariffs is felt in earnest,\u201d Huang wrote.",
      "Another survey released Monday, the Caixin manufacturing PMI survey, showed a similar improvement. That survey tends to show trends in smaller and export-oriented companies, Lynne Song of ING Economics said in a commentary.",
      "\u201cThis could be a valuable gauge of the impact new tariffs are having on the manufacturing sector. With an additional 10% tariff set to come into effect tomorrow, this seems likely,\u201d she said.",
      "Sudden increases in tariffs and other factors have raised uncertainty over the outlook for the world's second largest economy, which grew at a 5% annual pace last year, just meeting Beijing's official target.",
      "Premier Li Qiang will present an annual work report to the congress as it opens on Wednesday that traditionally provides the annual growth target for this year, among other policies and economic updates.",
      "2025 is the last year of leader Xi Jinping's \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d blueprint for upgrading Chinese industries to become global leaders in advanced technology. It also marks the end of China\u2019s 14th five-year plan, the party's traditional mid-term policy-setting document.",
      "A key priority is likely to be outlining ways to get Chinese consumers to spend more, a weak point in the state-dominated economy following the disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. The government has moved to provide more support for private industry in recent months as part of that effort. Exports and targeted spending increases have also helped."

      "Elon Musk appears be to turning off potential Tesla buyers with his embrace of far-right politicians around the world, analysts say, and the hit couldn't come at a worse time",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's car company is required each year to report to investors all the bad things that could happen to it, and the latest version lists every imaginable threat from costly lawsuits to out-of-control battery fires to war and another epidemic.",
      "But there\u2019s barely any mention in the latest annual update of Musk\u2019s full-bore entry into right-wing politics, which some experts say is turning off potential customers who don\u2019t share his views.",
      "\u201cIt's marketing 101: Don\u2019t involve yourself in politics,\u201d said New York brand consultant Robert Passikoff. \u201cPeople will stop buying your products.\u201d",
      "It may be too late.",
      "Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. That comes after a report of falling sales in California, its biggest U.S. market, and the first annual drop globally for the company last year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even want to drive it,\u201d said Model 3 owner John Parnell, a Democrat from Ross, California, adding that he also is cancelling his order for the company's Cybertruck, losing a $100 deposit. \u201cHe's destroying the brand with his politics.\u201d",
      "Car industry analysts say it's too early to say for sure how much damage Musk is causing to Tesla because so many other factors could explain its current troubles. It's best selling vehicle, the Model Y, is coming out with a new version this year, leading potential Tesla buyers to hold off purchases right now. And European and Chinese manufacturers are finally catching up to the world's EV leader, offering cars with battery life and dependability that are competitive.",
      "But, if anything, that makes Musk\u2019s political comments even more reckless, auto analysts say.",
      "\u201cMusk thinks he can say anything he wants to and doesn\u2019t think Tesla will suffer any consequences,\u201c said Morningstar analyst Seth Goldstein. \u201cTesla was in the sweet spot. Now it has competition.\u201d",
      "The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France in January, down roughly 60% each, more than the average decline for the more than two-dozen European countries surveyed. Sales in France fell another 26% in February.",
      "More worrisome was the breakdown for Tesla\u2019s individual models. Sales of Tesla\u2019s Model 3 dropped 33% across all European countries even though that car is not being updated and there is no reason for buyers to wait",
      "\u201cPart of the population is not happy with his views, his political activism,\u201d said Jato senior analyst Felipe Munoz who had shrugged off the boycott threat earlier this year, but is now having second thoughts.",
      "Many Tesla buyers used to be wealthy, environmentally-conscious professionals, often liberal, who were attracted to Musk's talk about how his EVs could help save the planet from fossil-fuel destruction.",
      "Not anymore.",
      "\u201cI used to be adored by the left,\u201d Musk said in an interview with Tucker Carlson on February 18 as his stock was halfway through a nearly 30% plunge for the month. \u201cLess so these days.\u201d",
      "His decision to spend $270 million on Donald Trump's presidential campaign and publicly back him was risky enough for his business. Then he doubled down, pursuing a slash-and-burn strategy as head of Trump's government efficiency team and taking his political revolution and incendiary talk abroad.",
      "He has backed the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an \u201cevil tyrant\u201d who runs a \u201cpolice state,\" and stated recently about a U.S. neighbor and major Tesla market, \u201cCanada is not a real country.\"",
      "The backlash has been fierce.",
      "Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized and bumper stickers appearing on its cars with sayings such as, \u201cI bought it before Elon went nuts.\u201d",
      "An effigy of Musk was hung in Milan and image of him doing a straight-arm salute projected on a Tesla factory outside Berlin. In London, a bus stop poster of him above the word \u201cswasticars\u201d lit up social media. A Polish government minister called for a Tesla boycott.",
      "\u201cI will not buy a Tesla again,\" said Jens Fischer, a 50-year-old microscope salesman in Witten, Germany, who thinks Musk is \u201cdestabilizing democracy\u201d and has slapped one of those \u201cElon went nuts\u201d stickers on his Model 3. \u201cI\u2019d sell if I got a good offer.\u201d",
      "Tesla investor Ross Gerber says Musk has somehow managed to marry the world's best product with the world's worst marketing.",
      "\u201cPeople want to buy stuff that makes them feel good, you don't want politics involved,\" said Gerber, a money manager whose portfolios hold nearly $60 million in Tesla stock. \u201cIt's even worse when you have such divisive issues, whether it\u2019s firing climate scientists or taking aid away from starving African children.\u201d",
      "Boycotts have a habit of fizzling out, and Morningstar's Goldstein says that buying a car is too big a decision and costs too much to make them successful targets, anyway.",
      "One Tesla owner, Londoner Harry Chathli, is unmoved by the backlash, saying he has no intention of getting rid of his Tesla S. He has nothing but praise for Musk who he calls a visionary for transforming \"the way we think about transportation and the future of our planet.\u201d",
      "But if Tesla's stock is any indicator, the company's prospects are deteriorating, and Musk's position in the Trump administration isn't helping. As of Friday, it has dropped 37% since its Inauguration Day, a loss of $550 billion in investor wealth.",

    "story": [
      "The recently announced U.S. tariffs on steel imports mean that countries like China, which export to the U.S., will need to find new markets \u2014 and that could lead to steel dumping in places like India",
      "BENGALURU, India -- Rows of small factories line the streets of a dusty suburb in Bengaluru, where workers weld and cast Indian-made steel into everything from car parts to kitchen sinks. Here, U.S. President Trump\u2019s announcement to impose high trade tariffs on steel imports has some unexpected supporters.",
      "Many industry workers and experts expect that the result of tariffs will be that cheap steel gets dumped in places like India. That's because the announced 25% tariff will make it too expensive for many companies in countries like China and South Korea to keep exporting to the U.S.",
      "For B. Praveen of Sun Techpro Engineering, which makes products from steel metal sheets, it means his \u201cwafer-thin\u201d profit margins will probably grow as the steel he buys gets cheaper.",
      "\u201cFor thousands of companies like mine, this can be a good thing,\u201d he said. Businesses such as Praveen's employ over 200 million Indians and are key drivers of India's economy.",
      "But cheaper steel in India isn't good for everyone. In February Naveen Jindal, the president of the Indian Steel Association, which represents all India\u2019s steelmakers, said that he was \u201cdeeply concerned,\u201d especially since \u201cIndia is one of the few major markets without any trade restrictions,\u201d making it a target for potential steel dumping. And the increased competition could impact efforts by India to produce its own steel more cleanly. The current production of most Indian steel releases high levels of greenhouse gas emissions, which cause climate change. Reduction efforts could be cut in the interest of keeping profits up.",
      "India is the world\u2019s most populous nation and one of the fastest-growing major economies. Steel demand is rising rapidly due to fast-paced urbanization, infrastructure, and industrial growth, and the government expects steel production to increase from 120 million tons to 300 million tons in the next five years.",
      "Currently, up to 12% of India's greenhouse gas emissions come from steelmaking according to the Global Energy Monitor, an organization that tracks energy projects around the globe. It found this could likely double in five years if more steel is produced as per the government's plans.",
      "Henna Khadeeja, a research analyst with GEM, explained that unlike China, Europe, or the United States, Indian steelmakers still mostly use coal-based blast furnaces to make steel, which are more high-emitting. In September last year, the Indian government said it would invest $1.72 billion to help the steel industry transition to cleaner methods of steelmaking.",
      "But Khadeeja said all the new steel expansion plans that have been announced are for coal-based steel production facilities. \u201cRight now, the focus is mostly on producing as much steel as possible. The strategy is mostly to retroactively decarbonize the steel once the capacity is built in place,\" she said.",
      "Building more coal-based blast furnaces make it more difficult for India to export its steel in the future, particularly to Europe, said Easwaran Narassimhan of the New Delhi-based think tank Sustainable Futures Collective. The European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, a tax on carbon emissions that Europe will begin charging for all products imported to the bloc from next year, would likely turn off any buyers from steel made with coal-based blast furnaces.",
      "\u201cChina\u2019s steel production is less emissions-intensive, which means it\u2019s going to face a lesser impact from European carbon taxes,\u201d said Narassimhan. \u201cAny amount of short-term pain today is going to be worth in the long run.\"",
      "India too has ambitious climate goals and wants to produce 500 gigawatts of clean power \u2014 enough to power nearly 300 million Indian homes \u2014 by the end of this decade. The South Asian nation recently crossed the milestone of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power, most of which was installed in the last 10 years.",
      "India also aims to go net zero \u2014 that is to stop adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere, either by preventing the emissions in the first place or removing an equivalent amount through natural or technological means \u2014 by 2070.",
      "Indian steelmakers said they recognize the need to emit less but are apprehensive about how much it'll cost them. \u201cIf you're not financially viable, you cannot exist as a business,\u201d said Prabodh Acharya, chief sustainability officer at JSW Group, one of India's biggest steel companies.",
      "\u201cSteel is essential for the growth of society and economy. We need to find the right balance between growth, economy and decarbonization,\u201d he said.",

      "As for youth, the major transition the team\u2019s undergone during John Wroblewski's three years as coach is most evident in goal.",
      "Led by returning starter Aerin Frankel, the goaltending trio is rounded out by 24-year-old Gwyneth Philips and University of Wisconsin sophomore Ava McNaughton. Philips and McNaughton fill the spots previously held by two-time Olympic goalies Nicole Hensley and Maddie Rooney.",
      "Nine players are 23 or younger, with 19-year-old Ohio State sophomore Joy Dunne the youngest.",
      "Meanwhile, PWHL rookie defenseman Anna Wilgren will make her national team debut after being among the last players cut from the 2022 Olympic roster.",
      "\u201cThe depth of our player pool never makes these decisions easy,\u201d U.S. women\u2019s national team director Katie Million said. \u201cBut we\u2019re excited to shift our focus on bringing a gold home.\u201d",
      "The 12-day, 10-nation tournament opens April 9 at Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic, and represents the final major international tune-up before the 2026 Winter Games in Italy.",
      "As in the past, the U.S. and Canada are regarded as favorites in continuing a long-standing fierce cross-border rivalry. Canada has won 13 world titles followed by the U.S. with 10 spanning the previous 23 tournaments.",
      "Canada is the defending champion after a thrilling 6-5 overtime win over the U.S. in last year\u2019s tournament held in Utica, New York. The Americans won in 2023, beating host Canada at the worlds held outside of Toronto.",
      "Canada edged the U.S. in winning three of five meetings in the pre-world Rivalry Series that closed last month.",
      "The second-year PWHL is well represented with 16 players making up the U.S. team.",
      "Forward Grace Zumwinkle, the PWHL\u2019s rookie of the year last season, reclaimed her national team roster spot after not making the team last year.",
      "The remainder of the roster features college players, including Wisconsin junior Laila Edwards, who leads the NCAA with 30 goals and ranks second with 64 points. The 21-year-old Edwards made a huge splash in her world championship debut last year by scoring six goals and two assists in being selected the tournament MVP.",
      "One notable player not selected to the roster is forward Hannah Bilka, who has been sidelined by an injury sustained in the Rivalry Series last month.",

      "Thomas Jolly filed a complaint for death threats after receiving homophobic and antisemitic abuse on social networks. The online attacks erupted after Jolly\u2019s acclaimed but controversial opening spectacle on the Seine in July \u2014 a queer-inclusive, high-energy fusion of tradition and modernity.",
      "Local media reported that Jolly did not attend Wednesday\u2019s hearing, with two of the people charged also not attending because they were either sick or could not make themselves available.",
      "The abuse last summer quickly escalated, including attacks based on Jolly's sexual orientation and wrongly assumed Israeli roots, and reportedly aimed to silence the artistic intent of the show. Jolly responded by filing a formal complaint with the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office on July 31, prompting an investigation that led to arrests in the south of France in October 2024.",
      "The seven people charged, ranging in age from 22 to 79, face counts of death threats, aggravated insults, and cyberbullying \u2014 serious allegations carrying the weight of potential prison time and heavy fines.",
      "A verdict in the Jolly\u2019s case is expected at a later date.",
      "The arrests were seen as a first step in France\u2019s fight against cyberbullying, which authorities noted has become increasingly sophisticated. In Jolly\u2019s case, prosecutors pointed to the disturbing \u201cpack behavior\u201d of attackers acting independently to escalate the harassment, a pattern seen in other online hate campaigns.",
      "Jolly\u2019s complaint came after the opening ceremony prompted a storm of outrage in the wake of a contentious scene featuring drag queens and other performers. Although Jolly has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t inspired by \u201cThe Last Supper,\u201d vocal criticism of the show from some quarters interpreted it as a mockery of Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s painting depicting Jesus Christ and his apostles.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron extended full support to Jolly and all performing artists who were part of the Olympics opening show. Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also expressed \u201cunwavering support\u201d of Jolly in the face of the threats and harassment.",

      "\u2014 Is funded through at least 2032 with a goal of going beyond that.",
      "The foundation, launched in 2013 as the chairtable arm of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee, raised around $230 million in the four years ending in 2024 to fund direct support to athletes. It is shooting for $500 million for the four-year period ending with the LA Olympics in 2028.",

      "Hearing Pearl\u2019s comments about the Aggies meant a lot to Texas A&M coach Buzz Williams, who said physicality and communication are the two most important things he tries to teach.",
      "\u201cWe have to play incredibly physical, and I think we have to do a lot of the things that are not necessarily in the stat sheet for for us to win,\u201d Williams said.",
      "The Tigers were also hurt by an off night from top scorer Johni Broome, who entered the game averaging 18.4 points but managed just eight. He left the game for a couple of minutes early in the first half with what appeared to be a shoulder injury but played 32 minutes despite the problem.",
      "\u201cIt may have affected him,\u201d Pearl said. \u201cHe obviously had a shoulder injury in December. He had it banged a few times and it he obviously had it banged (Tuesday) and it was bothering him. He tried to play through it.\u201d",

      "So many world championship belts. Ngamba wants one of her own.",
      "\u201cI saw Natasha Jonas and Lauren Price and Caroline Dubois with their belts, and I remember saying \u2018Oh, that looks nice, I would love to have one of them,'\" she said.",
      "Achieving goals is kind of Ngamba\u2019s thing. At the Paris Games, she became the first athlete competing as a refugee to earn a medal when she took bronze in the middleweight category.",
      "A decade ago the Cameroon\u2014born Ngamba thought she was about to be deported from Britain. Now she's set to make her professional debut at Royal Albert Hall. She\u2019s facing veteran Kirstie Bavington in a super welterweight bout in London as part of an all-female card headlined by the Jonas vs. Price welterweight world title unification fight.",
      "\u201cI can see it, that dream of me having a belt and being the world champion,\u201d Ngamba told The Associated Press, \u201cbut at the same time you have to be in the present and you have to make sure you get the job done.\u201d",
      "The 26-year-old Ngamba tries not to think ahead too much. That\u2019s because she knows circumstances can change so quickly.",
      "Ngamba had arrived in Britain at age 11 \u2014 her father and siblings live here, too \u2014 in Bolton, just north of Manchester, and set about learning English and trying to fit in. She picked up boxing at age 15, and it became an escape from the stress of worrying about her residency status.",
      "She described being arrested as a teenager while checking in at an immigration center in Manchester.",
      "\u201cMy case was still pending. I applied and they rejected it. When they reject your case, you have to go and re-apply again. I was in a situation where even though I was re-applying every time, they could have arrested me at any moment,\" she said. \u201cI visualized that they could arrest me in the street or in my house, in school or with my friends. I never knew it was going to be at an immigration center where I usually (went) every weekend.\u201d",
      "Worried she would be deported, she thought to herself: \"'I have no one in Cameroon, no family in Cameroon. Who is going to take care of me?\u2019\u201d",
      "She was held overnight at a detention facility in London before being released.",
      "Ngamba, who came out as gay when she was 18, eventually won her case and was given refugee status. Same-sex relations in Cameroon can result in prison sentences of five years in the country.",
      "Her progress in the boxing ring \u2014 Ngamba was an England amateur champion at three different weights \u2014 attracted the attention of Britain\u2019s elite development program. Ngamba was brought in to spar the likes of Jonas, Price and others in hopes that she would eventually compete for Britain.",
      "Ngamba, one of the flagbearers for the Olympic refugee team at the opening ceremony in Paris, is still treated as one of their own at \u201cGB Boxing.\u201d After the Olympics, her name was added to the wall of fame at the English Institute of Sport in Sheffield, and she joined British Olympians at a Buckingham Palace reception where she meet King Charles III.",
      "The main attraction is a welterweight clash of generations with 40-year-old Natasha Jonas facing 30-year-old Lauren Price.",
      "Both are former Olympians. Welsh boxer Price (8-0) won a gold medal for Britain at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. She is the WBA champion.",
      "Jonas (16-2-1), of Liverpool, competed at the 2012 London Games when women\u2019s boxing made its debut in the Olympic program. She fell just short of a medal when she lost to Ireland\u2019s Katie Taylor in the quarterfinals. Jonas holds the WBC and IBF welterweight titles.",
      "American boxer Mikaela Mayer holds the other major welterweight belt \u2014 the WBO championship.",
      "WBC lightweight champion Caroline Dubois is also on the card. Dubois, whose older brother Daniel is the IBF heavyweight champion, will face Bo Mi Re Shin of South Korea.",
      "It\u2019s the second all-female event by promotion company Boxxer and Sky Sports following their October 2022 event at a sold-out O2 Arena (20,000 capacity) in London. Sky said that event had a TV audience of more than 2 million in Britain and Ireland.",
      "By comparison, Royal Albert Hall is a smaller arena with an expected sellout at 5,200. The venue goes way back in boxing, though.",

    "story": [
      "NASCAR has filed a counterclaim against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports alleging they \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws in connection with the most recent charter agreements",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR's revenue-sharing charter system is under threat of being disbanded according to a Wednesday counterclaim filed by the stock car series against Michael Jordan-owned 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports that singles out Jordan's longtime business manager.",
      "The contentiousness began after more than two years of negotiations on new charter agreements \u2014 NASCAR's equivalent of a franchise model \u2014 and the 30-page filing contends that Jordan business manager Curtis Polk \u201cwillfully\u201d violated antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the most recent charter agreements.",
      "23XI and Front Row were the only two organizations out of 15 that refused to sign the new agreements, which were presented to the teams last September in a take-it-or-leave-it offer a mere 48 hours before the start of NASCAR's playoffs.",
      "The charters were fought for by the teams ahead of the 2016 season and twice have been extended. The latest extension is for seven years to match the current media rights deal and guarantee 36 of the 40 spots in each week's field to the teams that hold them, as well as other financial incentives. 23XI and Front Row refused to sign and sued, alleging NASCAR and the France family that owns the stock car series are a monopoly.",
      "NASCAR already has lost one round in court in which the two teams have been recognized as chartered organizations for the 2025 season as the legal dispute winds through the courts.",
      "In the new counterclaim, Polk is repeatedly singled out as the ringleader against the current charter proposals. NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates went so far as to tell The Associated Press that Polk, who in addition to being Jordan's business manager is a co-owner of 23XI along with three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, does not understand the NASCAR business model.",
      "\u201cCurtis Polk basically orchestrated and threatened a boycott of one of the qualifying races for a major event and others did not go along with him,\u201d Yates said. \u201cHe got other teams to boycott a meeting that was required by the charter. When you have a threatened boycott of qualifying races that are covered by media that's not a good thing for other race teams, not a good thing when you are trying to collectively grow the sport.\"",
      "The qualifying race in question was the 2024 pair of 150-mile duels that set the field for the Daytona 500.",
      "\u201cI don't think Mr. Polk really understands the sport,\u201d Yates told the AP. \u201cI think he came into it and his view is it should be much more like the NBA or other league sports. But it's not. No motorsport is like that. He's done a lot of things that might work in the NBA or might be OK in the NBA but just are not appropriate in NASCAR.\u201d",
      "NASCAR's complaint alleges \u201cthe undisputed reality is that it is 23XI and FRM, led by 23XI\u2019s owner and sports agent Curtis Polk, that willfully violated the antitrust laws by orchestrating anticompetitive collective conduct in connection with the terms of the 2025 Charter Agreements.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is truly ironic that in trying to blow-up the Charter system, 23XI and FRM have sought to weaponize the antitrust laws to achieve their goals,\" the counterclaim says, alleging Polk's threats are \u201cattempting to misuse the legal system as a last resort to secure new terms.\u201d",
      "Bob Jenkins, an entrepreneur, owns Front Row Motorsports and joined 23XI in the lawsuit when he declined to sign the 2025 charter agreement last September.",
      "NASCAR's counterclaim asks for an injunction eliminating guaranteed starting spots for charter teams. NASCAR wants the four combined charters held by 23XI and Front Row before the lawsuit to be returned to NASCAR, and it wants to dissolve the two charters each team purchased ahead of the 2025 season for their own individual expansion.",
      "\u201cThere's a misperception out there that somehow 23IX and Front Row might achieve something that other teams can take advantage of, and that's just not right,\u201d Yates told the AP. \"This is not going to be a renegotiation. NASCAR has no intent of renegotiating the terms of the charter. Front Row and 23XI are threatening the charter system and its continuation, and NASCAR is fine without the charter system.",
      "\u201cThe charter system was created at the request of the teams. That was before 23XI and Curtis Polk's time, I don't think they understand that history. But if they succeed with their lawsuit and the charter system goes away, that's OK.\u201d",
      "Yates told the AP he's asked Jeffrey Kessler, the attorney representing 23XI and Front Row, what is it the two teams want and cannot get a straight answer.",
      "\u201cThe mere fact that the lawsuit calls the system into question, I really think 23XI and Front Row are being pretty selfish in terms of what they are trying to do, and I don't think they are taking into account the 32 teams that have signed the charters and think it is a good deal for them,\" Yates said. \u201cDo some of them think they should have gotten more? I'm sure. Does NASCAR think it should have gotten more? Absolutely. But NASCAR does not see the charter system as necessary.\u201d",
      "Jordan has said he's suing NASCAR on behalf of all the teams so that even the smallest ones can receive equal footing in terms of benefits as a participant in the top motorsports league in the United States.",
      "Among the improvements in the 2025 charters is a more equitable revenue share, but missing is the demand that teams wanted the charters to become permanent. NASCAR at its discretion can claw back charters from underperforming teams or eliminate the system completely. Yates said NASCAR has no intention of renegotiating the charters signed in September by 13 organizations, nor did he see a scenario in which NASCAR settles the lawsuit.",
      "\u201cPolk and 23XI\u2019s other owners openly professed that they wanted to change NASCAR\u2019s economic model by demanding more money for the teams from NASCAR media revenues, instead of teams competing against each other,\" Yates said. \u201cHowever, 23XI and FRM did not merely reject the terms of the 2025 Charters. Rather, those teams embarked on a strategy to threaten, coerce, and extort NASCAR into meeting their demands for better contract and financial terms.\u201d",

TKO will handle production, media and promotion for events that will include worldwide broadcasts. There was little immediate detail outside of the announcement of the promotion's impending launch.",

      "The kingdom plans to spend tens of billion of dollars on projects related to the World Cup as part of the crown prince\u2019s sweeping Vision 2030 project that aims to modernize Saudi society and economy. At its core is spending on sports by the $900 billion sovereign wealth operation, the Public Investment Fund, which Salman oversees.",
      "Critics have accused Saudi Arabia of \u201csportswashing,\" an effort to rebrand a nation\u2019s troubling public image that has been going on for decades, using the Olympics and other sports across the globe.",

      "The Florida Panthers continue to be active in the leadup to the NHL trade deadline",
      "The defending Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers continue to be active in the leadup to the NHL trade deadline.",
      "The Panthers acquired goaltender Vitek Vanecek on Wednesday from the San Jose Sharks for 25-year-old forward Patrick Giles, the teams announced.",
      "Vanecek gives Florida depth in net, along with Chris Driedger, behind two-time Vezina Trophy-winning starter Sergei Bobrovsky. The trade comes after the team sent Spencer Knight to Chicago as part of a blockbuster deal for top-pairing defenseman Seth Jones.",
      "Florida will be the fourth NHL organization for Vanecek, who was 3-10-3 in 18 appearances with San Jose this season. The Sharks held him out of their game Tuesday night at Buffalo in preparation of trading the 29-year-old from Czechia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of the business,\u201d said Sharks goaltender Alexandar Georgiev, who was traded there from Colorado for Mackenzie Blackwood earlier this season. \u201cUnfortunately sometimes players get moved. ... Hopefully it\u2019s a good opportunity for him.\u201d",
      "The Sharks in Giles get a young player to add to their core built around No. 1 pick and rookie-of-the-year candidate Macklin Celebrini. Giles appeared in nine NHL games for the Panthers earlier this season without a point. He has mostly been with the team\u2019s American Hockey League affiliate in Charlotte.",
      "San Jose in a corresponding roster move recalled Georgi Romanov from the Barracuda of the AHL.",
      "The goalie market ahead of the 3 p.m. EST deadline Friday remains thin outside of perhaps Anaheim's John Gibson, but other talks continue to pick up around the league. After signing pending free agent tough guy Mathieu Olivier to a six-year, $18 million extension, Columbus Blue Jackets general manager Don Waddell signaled he's open for business \u2014 to a certain extent.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re certainly making calls and taking calls,\u201d Waddell said. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along: We\u2019re not in the position to trade first-round picks for rental players or anything like that. If we can add around the edges, certainly we\u2019re going to try that. I\u2019m more interested in hockey deals with maybe players that have term left on their contract. We\u2019re exploring obviously as many of those as we can.\u201d",
      "The Blue Jackets have a handful of other pending UFAs, who Waddell does not expect to re-sign before the deadline but might keep just to help his team fight for a playoff spot.",
      "\u201cIf I rip a guy out of this locker room right now (who is) playing a role for us on this hockey club right now, I think that\u2019s pretty devastating to our team,\u201d Waddell said. \"I think it\u2019s the wrong message from my end. I think it\u2019s the wrong message to our fans, the coaches and the players.\u201d",

      "Bill Belichick is back on the practice sidelines again, though now in college at North Carolina",
      "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- Bill Belichick is back on the practice sidelines again, a familiar home for the man who won six Super Bowls as an NFL head coach.",
      "Only now the setting is a small college town. And instead of that familiar hoodie, he was instead decked in a navy blue short-sleeved quarter-zip top and ballcap, along with mesh shorts in that distinctive shade of Carolina blue.",
      "The 72-year-old is a rookie in college coaching, opening his first set of spring practices this week since taking over at North Carolina as part of that school's audacious bet to upgrade its football program.",
      "\u201cThat's the great thing about being a head coach \u2014 I can coach anybody I want,\u201d Belichick quipped at his pre-practice news conference Wednesday. \"I can coach the line, I can yell at the tight ends, I can yell at the DBs, I can yell at the kickers.",
      "\u201cI can go to any group I want and coach them. And honestly, that's the fun part.\u201d",
      "When the news conference ended, Belichick started to walk away from the podium when he realized he left his whistle behind. He paused, picked it up and blew a short quick chirp \u2014 offering a bit of a symbolic start to spring drills for the media, anyway.",
      "Belichick was hired in December and had a signed contract for a five-year deal \u2014 though only the first three years are guaranteed with $10 million annually in base and supplemental salary \u2014 a month later. The goal is to build a pro-style model at the college level, creating what amounts to a \u201c33rd\u201d NFL team as general manager and former NFL executive Michael Lombardi put it last month.",
      "He had continued appearances on ESPN\u2019s \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d and had been spotted in social media posts from the recruiting trail or attending men\u2019s basketball games at the Smith Center, but he hadn\u2019t spoken to local reporters since his introductory news conference nearly three months ago.",
      "The Tar Heels opened spring practices Tuesday, then let media members watch about 20 minutes of Wednesday's practice \u2014 though Belichick stood behind the end zone roughly 50-plus yards away from where they were allowed to observe.",
      "Throw in the fact that the players aren\u2019t wearing numbers, and it was hard to pick up much of anything in that brief window.",
      "His news conference proved more revealing in that regard, with Belichick providing fuller answers than the terse and grumpy responses he was known for with the New England Patriots. That included talking about the new wrinkle for him of having spring practices in pads at the college level, something that wasn't the case in the NFL.",
      "He pointed to his time being around the Washington program as the Huskies prepared to enter the Big Ten before this past season. His son, Steve, worked there as defensive coordinator and Belichick said the progress made during those sessions last spring was \u201cremarkable.\u201d",
      "Now he gets to try it with his own program in Chapel Hill.",
      "\u201cThe response has been great,\u201d Belichick said of connecting with teenagers and college-age players as opposed to NFL veterans in their mid- or late-30s. \"It's kind of similar to what a rookie minicamp would be and time with the rookies. Granted, those kids are a little bit older, but they're coming in from all different programs and different situations.",
      "\"So it's starting to put everything together: here's how we do things, here's what our expectations are, this is what you need to do to be successful. They've embraced that, they've tried to do it.\"",
      "Belichick teamed with quarterback Tom Brady during most of his 24-year tenure with the Patriots that included those six titles, most recently coming in the 2018 season. That run in Foxborough ended after the 2023 season, leaving Belichick with 333 career regular-season and postseason wins to trail Don Shula by just 14 for the NFL record.",
      "He had been linked to NFL jobs after his exit from the Patriots, but nothing materialized \u2014 and soon, Belichick had made his first jump into college football after the Tar Heels moved on from Mack Brown as the winningest coach in program history.",
      "UNC formally announced his coaching staff earlier this week, featuring a mix of NFL and college experience. The list includes former Cleveland Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens as a holdover from Mack Brown\u2019s staff, as well as sons Steve (defensive coordinator/linebackers) and Brian (defensive backs/safeties).",
      "Belichick said it's too early to know how things will go with roster management for the upcoming season, including when it comes to the transfer portal for additions and departures after the 15-practice spring session concludes April 12.",
      "UNC's longer-range target is a college-version of Monday Night Football, with the Tar Heels hosting TCU on Labor Day to open Belichick's tenure.",
      "\u201cWe'll go out there and do what we do and see what happens, see how it goes,\" Belichick said.",
      "\u201cI know we have a good plan. I know we can do the right things to help the players improve, help the team improve and put a good product on the field.\u201d",

      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- A federal judge has denied Elon Musk's request for a court order blocking OpenAI from converting itself to a for-profit company but said she could expedite a trial to consider Musk's claims against the ChatGPT maker and its CEO.",
      "U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled late Tuesday that \u201cMusk has not demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits\u201d in his request for a preliminary injunction. She offered to hold a trial in her California courtroom as soon as this fall, \u201cgiven the public interest at stake and potential for harm if a conversion contrary to law occurred.\u201d",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor, began a legal offensive against the ChatGPT maker and CEO Sam Altman a year ago, suing for breach of contract over what he said was the betrayal of its founding aims as a nonprofit.",
      "He escalated the legal dispute late last year, adding new claims and defendants, including Microsoft, and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business. Musk also added his own AI company, xAI, as a plaintiff, claiming that OpenAI was unfairly stifling business competition.",
      "He and a group of investors more recently made an unsolicited $97.4 billion bid to buy a controlling stake in the nonprofit \u2014 a move that undermined Musk\u2019s \u201cclaim of irreparable harm,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "OpenAI said it welcomed the court\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThis has always been about competition,\u201d a statement from the company said. \u201cElon\u2019s own emails show that he wanted to merge a for-profit OpenAI into Tesla. That would have been great for his personal benefit, but not for our mission or U.S. interests.\u201d",
      "Musk alleges in the lawsuit that the companies are violating the terms of his foundational contributions to the charity. He had invested about $45 million in the startup from its founding until 2018, his lawyer has said.",
      "Musk attorney Marc Toberoff said in a statement late Tuesday that he is pleased that the court offered an expedited trial on the core claims.",
      "\"We look forward to a jury confirming that Altman accepted Musk\u2019s charitable contributions knowing full well they had to be used for the public\u2019s benefit rather than his own enrichment,\u201d Toberoff said.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers in a hearing last month called it a \u201cstretch\u201d to claim \u201cirreparable harm\u201d to Musk, and she called the case \u201cbillionaires vs. billionaires.\u201d She questioned why Musk invested tens of millions in OpenAI without a written contract. Toberoff responded that it was because the relationship between Altman and Musk at the time was \u201cbuilt on trust\u201d and the two were very close.",
      "\u201cThat is just a lot of money\u201d to invest \u201con a handshake,\u201d the judge said.",
      "The dispute has roots in a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI\u2019s CEO.",
      "Emails disclosed by OpenAI show Musk had also sought to be CEO and grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO and has remained so except for a period in 2023 when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers, appointed by then-President Barack Obama in 2011, has handled a number of tech industry cases including Apple\u2019s fight with Epic Games, though she said last month that Musk\u2019s case is \u201cnothing like\u201d that one.

      "Teaching machines in the way that animal trainers mold the behavior of dogs or horses has been an important method for developing artificial intelligence and one that was recognized Wednesday with the top computer science award.",
      "Two pioneers in the field of reinforcement learning, Andrew Barto and Richard Sutton, are the winners of this year's A.M. Turing Award, the tech world's equivalent of the Nobel Prize.",
      "Research that Barto, 76, and Sutton, 67, began in the late 1970s paved the way for some of the past decade's AI breakthroughs. At the heart of their work was channeling so-called \u201chedonistic\u201d machines that could continuously adapt their behavior in response to positive signals.",
      "Reinforcement learning is what led a Google computer program to beat the world's best human players of the ancient Chinese board game Go in 2016 and 2017. It's also been a key technique in improving popular AI tools like ChatGPT, optimizing financial trading and helping a robotic hand solve a Rubik's Cube.",
      "But Barto said the field was \"not fashionable\u201d when he and his doctoral student, Sutton, began crafting their theories and algorithms at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.",
      "\u201cWe were kind of in the wilderness,\u201d Barto said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWhich is why it\u2019s so gratifying to receive this award, to see this becoming more recognized as something relevant and interesting. In the early days, it was not.\u201d",
      "Google sponsors the annual $1 million prize, which was announced Wednesday by the Association for Computing Machinery.",
      "Barto, now retired from the University of Massachusetts, and Sutton, a longtime professor at Canada's University of Alberta, aren't the first AI pioneers to win the award named after British mathematician, codebreaker and early AI thinker Alan Turing. But their research has directly sought to answer Turing's 1947 call for a machine that \u201ccan learn from experience\u201d \u2014 which Sutton describes as \u201carguably the essential idea of reinforcement learning.\u201d",
      "In particular, they borrowed from ideas in psychology and neuroscience about the way that pleasure-seeking neurons respond to rewards or punishment. In one landmark paper published in the early 1980s, Barto and Sutton set their new approach on a specific task in a simulated world: balance a pole on a moving cart to keep it from falling. The two computer scientists later co-authored a widely used textbook on reinforcement learning.",
      "\u201cThe tools they developed remain a central pillar of the AI boom and have rendered major advances, attracted legions of young researchers, and driven billions of dollars in investments,\u201d said Google\u2019s chief scientist Jeff Dean in a written statement.",

      "A new study says early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Early humans were regularly using animal bones to make cutting tools 1.5 million years ago.",
      "A newly discovered cache of 27 carved and sharpened bones from elephants and hippos found in Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge site pushes back the date for ancient bone tool use by around 1 million years. Researchers know that early people made simple tools from stones as early as 3.3 million years ago.",
      "The new discovery, published Wednesday in Nature, reveals that ancient humans \u201chad rather more complex tool kits than previously we thought,\u201d incorporating a variety of materials, said William Harcourt-Smith, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History, who was not involved in the research.",
      "The well-preserved bone tools, measuring up to around 16 inches (40 centimeters), were likely made by breaking off the thick ends of leg bones and using a stone to knock off flakes from the remaining bone shaft. This technique was used to create one sharpened edge and one pointed tip, said study co-author Ignacio de la Torre, a researcher at the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "The bone tools were \u201cprobably used as a hand axe\u201d \u2013 a handheld blade that\u2019s not mounted on a stick \u2013 for butchering dead animals, he said.",
      "Such a blade would be handy for removing meat from elephant and hippo carcasses, but not used as a spear or projectile point. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe they were hunting these animals. They were probably scavenging,\u201d he said.",
      "Some of the artifacts show signs of having been struck to remove flakes more than a dozen times, revealing persistent craftsmanship.",
      "The uniform selection of the bones \u2013 large and heavy leg bones from specific animals \u2013 and the consistent pattern of alteration makes it clear that early humans deliberately chose and carved these bones, said M\u00edrian Pacheco, a paleobiologist at the Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The bone show minimal signs of erosion, trampling or gnawing by other animals \u2014 ruling out the possibility that natural causes resulted in the tool shapes, she added.",
      "The bone tools date from more than a million years before our species, Homo sapiens, arose around 300,000 years ago.",
      "At the time the tools were made, three different species of human ancestors lived in the same region of East Africa, said Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian\u2019s Human Origins Program, who was not involved in the study.",
      "The tools may have been made and used by Homo erectus, Homo habilis or Paranthropus boisei. \u201cIt could have been any of these three, but it\u2019s almost impossible to know which one,\u201d said Pobiner.",

      "China is denying the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s accusations against 12 Chinese nationals charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities",
      "WASHINGTON -- Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department says.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials said Wednesday is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China's first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The targets were in some cases directed by China's Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment Wednesday.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday denied the charges, calling the U.S. \u201chypocritical\" and pointing to U.S. cyberattacks on China.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes the groundless accusation made by the US and urges the US to immediately stop abusing sanctions,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a press conference in Beijing.",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They've downsized and moved offices.",
      "\"Apparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\" Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d",

      "The majority of the stolen tickets were for Swift\u2019s Eras Tour, but the thieves also boosted ones for Adele and Ed Sheeran concerts, NBA games and the U.S. Open Tennis Championships.",
      "Katz added that investigators are still determining the extent of the operation, including other potential co-conspirators.",
      "Two of those involved, Tyrone Rose and Shamara Simmons, were arrested and charged last Thursday with grand larceny, computer tampering and conspiracy charges, Katz's office said.",

      "StubHub said Tuesday that it had discovered the criminal scheme and reported it to authorities and its third-party customer service vendor.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m officially now one of the people trying to buy TikTok US \u2014 and bring it on-chain,\u201d Ohanian said in a series of posts made Tuesday on X, referencing a decentralized, blockchain-based platform that Project Liberty says it will leverage to provide users more control over their online data.",
      "If successful in its bid, Project Liberty said the technology \u201cwill serve as the backbone of the redesigned TikTok, ensuring that privacy, security, and digital independence are no longer optional but foundational.\u201d When asked by an X user on Monday what he would call TikTok if he purchased it, Ohanian said: \u201cTikTok: Freedom Edition.\u201d",
      "Under a federal bill passed with bipartisan support and signed into law by former President Joe Biden last year, TikTok was required to cut ties with its China-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a ban by Jan. 19.",

      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Since then, the company has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \u201cengineer them into living animals,\u201d said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you\u2019re not bringing back the ancient past,\u201d said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \u201cColossal woolly mouse.\u201d",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\u201d said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \u201cmake it a lot more efficient and easier,\u201d said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \u201cpresent already in some living mice,\u201d said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \u201cwe put them all together in a single mouse.\u201d",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \u201ca lot of processes and red tape\u201d before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \u201cde-extinction.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it\u2019s not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It\u2019s changing an Asian elephant,\u201d said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal\u2019s technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s part of how we monetize our business,\u201d said Lamm.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts are just a few weeks away from finally returning to Earth after nine months in space.",
      "Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams have to wait until their replacements arrive at the International Space Station next week before they can check out later this month.",
      "They\u2019ll be joined on their SpaceX ride home by two astronauts who launched by themselves in September alongside two empty seats.",
      "During a news conference Tuesday, Wilmore said that while politics is part of life, it did not play into his and Williams' return, moved up a couple weeks thanks to a change in SpaceX capsules. President Donald Trump and SpaceX's Elon Musk said at the end of January that they wanted to accelerate the astronauts' return, blaming the previous administration.",
      "But Williams, in response to a question, did take issue with Musk's recent call to dump the space station in two years, rather than waiting until NASA's projected deorbit in 2031. She noted all the scientific research being performed at the orbiting lab.",
      "\u201cThis place is ticking. It's just really amazing, so I would say we're actually in our prime right now,\u201d said Williams, a three-time space station resident. \u201cI would think that right now is probably not the right time to say quit, call it quits.\u201d",
      "Williams said she can't wait to be reunited with her Labrador retrievers. The hardest part about the unexpected extended stay, she added, was the wait by their families back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a roller coaster for them, probably a little bit more so than for us,\" she said. \u201cWe're here. We have a mission. We're just just doing what we do every day, and every day is interesting because we're up in space and it's a lot of fun.\u201d",
      "Wilmore and Williams expected to be gone just a week or so when they launched last June aboard Boeing\u2019s new Starliner capsule, making its crew debut after years of delay. The Starliner had so many problems getting to the space station that NASA ruled it too dangerous to carry anyone and it flew back empty.",
      "Their homecoming was further delayed by extra completion time needed for the brand new SpaceX capsule that was supposed to deliver their replacements.",
      "Last month, NASA announced the next crew would launch in a used capsule instead, pushing up liftoff to March 12. The two crews will spend about a week together aboard the space station before Wilmore and Williams depart with NASA\u2019s Nick Hague and the Russian Space Agency\u2019s Alexander Gorbunov.",
      "Wilmore and Williams \u2014 retired Navy captains and repeat space fliers \u2014 have insisted over the months that they are healthy and committed to the mission as long as it takes. They took a spacewalk together in January.",
      "They will wear generic SpaceX flight suits for the ride back, not the usual custom-made outfits bearing their names because their trip home in a Dragon capsule was unplanned. That's fine with them, although Wilmore hinted he might use a pen to write his name on his suit.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just Butch and Suni,\" Williams said. \u201cEverybody knows who we are by now.\"",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s what they\u2019re collecting, it\u2019s how they work,\u201d information commissioner John Edwards said. \u201cI will expect to find that there will be many benign and positive uses of children\u2019s data in their recommender systems.\"",
      "\u201cWhat I am concerned about is whether they are sufficiently robust to prevent children being exposed to harm, either from addictive practices on the device or the platform, or from content that they see, or from other unhealthy practices,\u201d he said.",
      "As part of the investigation, the regulator will also look into how online forum site Reddit and image-sharing site Imgur use children's personal data and how they estimate or verify a child's age.",
      "TikTok, which is operated by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, said in a statement that it was \u201cdeeply committed to ensuring a positive experience for young people on TikTok.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Some Georgia lawmakers are trying to get rid of automated cameras that enforce school zone speed limits, saying the cameras are more about making money than the safety of children",
      "DECATUR, Ga. -- Outside Beacon Hill Middle School in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, like along hundreds of roadsides across Georgia, the unblinking eye of a camera tickets drivers who speed through a school zone.",
      "Supporters say cameras slow down drivers and provide constant enforcement that understaffed police departments can't equal. But some state lawmakers want to ban them, saying the cameras are more about generating money for local governments and camera companies, and that some use them deceptively.",
      "More than 20 states and the District of Columbia allow automated traffic cameras to issue speeding tickets, but more than 10 other states have outlawed them. However, it would be unusual for a state to reverse its position. New Jersey had a pilot program testing cameras to enforce red lights, but pulled the plug in 2014.",
      "Georgia's fight will come to a head soon in its General Assembly, with three separate bills advancing out of committees. The state first authorized speed cameras, but only in school zones, in 2018.",
      "More than 100 representatives in Georgia's 180-member House signed on to House Bill 225, which would ban the cameras. Dale Washburn, the Macon Republican sponsoring that measure, provided a stack of emails from outraged people ticketed statewide who said lights weren't flashing, they didn't even know they were in a school zone, or the cameras were otherwise unfair.",
      "While the tickets in Georgia are civil citations and don't go on a driver\u2019s criminal record, the state does block people who don\u2019t pay from renewing their vehicle registration. Almost 125,000 unpaid violations were reported in 2024, the Georgia Department of Revenue said. The cameras generated more than $112 million in revenue in 54 Georgia cities and counties since 2019, WANF-TV found last year. Camera companies typically take a share of the revenue.",
      "\u201cThese camera companies are engaged in deceit and trickery,\u201d Washburn said. \u201cTheir goal is to write tickets, not to enhance children\u2019s safety.\"",
      "One issue with abolishing cameras is that companies have become big political donors. Two big vendors, United Kingdom-based RedSpeed and Tennessee-based Blue Line Solutions, contributed around $500,000 to Georgia campaigns in recent years, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan watchdog that tracks money in politics.",
      "Legislative leaders seem more likely to support two other bills that would keep cameras, but more closely regulate them by providing better warning signs and limiting the hours of usage.",
      "\u201cSo the objective is to alert drivers that they're entering a school zone and get them to slow down and then for them not to be cited unless they are speeding in a school zone during designated hours,\u201d said Republican Sen. Max Burns of Sylvania, who is sponsoring Senate Bill 75.",
      "An alternate House bill that is similar to Burns' would require half the money raised go to school safety.",
      "In Decatur, students surge out of Beacon Hill Middle at dismissal and walk along College Avenue, a two-lane street that's also a state highway. Unlike most places in Georgia, where most students travel home in buses or their parents' cars, a majority of Decatur's 5,300 students either walk or ride bikes home.",
      "Decatur Mayor Patti Garrett said a student at Beacon Hill was struck in a hit-and-run accident and a crossing guard elsewhere was also hit before Decatur activated its cameras last fall.",
      "\u201cWe really want to protect our most vulnerable residents, our students, and particularly when they are on foot or on a bicycle,\" Garrett said.",
      "Police Chief Scott Richards said according to a speed study conducted by the company, speeding has fallen 92%. But there are still plenty of drivers flying through the five zones where Decatur is using cameras. They issued 4,500 valid citations in January alone, he said.",
      "\u201cWe would not be able to get those reductions if it were not for the photo enforcement in school zones,\u201d Richards said.",
      "Decatur officials tout their efforts as a model, saying the city has abundant signage and only operates the cameras for a 30 minutes before and after schools begin in the morning and dismiss in the afternoon. A vehicle must be traveling 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) per hour over the speed limit to be cited.",
      "Still, Washburn and others say the amount of money involved encourages overuse and bad behavior.",
      "\u201cProfit-based law enforcement cannot be trusted,\u201d John Moore of Milledgeville wrote to Washburn in February. \u201cI hope you can convince your colleagues to vote this menace out of our state for good.\u201d"

      "\u201cMy initial shock turned to horror when I learned that the same person targeted about 80, 85 other women, most of whom live in Minnesota, some of whom I know personally, and all of them had connections in some way to the offender,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Backed by her testimony, Minnesota is considering a new strategy for cracking down on deepfake pornography. A bill that has bipartisan support would target companies that run websites and apps allowing people to upload a photo that then would be transformed into explicit images or videos.",
      "States across the country and Congress are considering strategies for regulating artificial intelligence. Most have banned the dissemination of sexually explicit deepfakes or revenge porn whether they were produced with AI or not. The idea behind the Minnesota legislation is to prevent the material from ever being created \u2014 before it spreads online.",
      "Experts on AI law caution the proposal might be unconstitutional on free speech grounds.",
      "The lead author, Democratic Sen. Erin Maye Quade, said additional restrictions are necessary because AI technology has advanced so rapidly. Her bill would require the operators of \u201cnudification\u201d sites and apps to turn them off to people in Minnesota or face civil penalties up to $500,000 \u201cfor each unlawful access, download, or use.\u201d Developers would need to figure out how to exclude Minnesota users.",
      "It\u2019s not just the dissemination that\u2019s harmful to victims, she said. It\u2019s the fact that these images exist at all.",
      "Kelly told reporters last month that anyone can quickly create \u201chyper-realistic nude images or pornographic video\u201d in minutes.",
      "Most law enforcement attention so far has been focused on distribution and possession.",
      "San Francisco in August filed a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against several widely visited \u201cnudification\u201d websites, alleging they broke state laws against fraudulent business practices, nonconsensual pornography and the sexual abuse of children. That case remains pending.",
      "The U.S. Senate last month unanimously approved a bill by Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Republican Ted Cruz, of Texas, to make it a federal crime to publish nonconsensual sexual imagery, including AI-generated deepfakes. Social media platforms would be required to remove them within 48 hours of notice from a victim. Melania Trump on Monday used her first solo appearance since becoming first lady again to urge passage by the Republican-controlled House, where it's pending.",
      "The Kansas House last month approved a bill that expands the definition of illegal sexual exploitation of a child to include possession of images generated with AI if they're \u201cindistinguishable from a real child, morphed from a real child\u2019s image or generated without any actual child involvement.\u201d",
      "A bill introduced in the Florida Legislature creates a new felony for people who use technology such as AI to generate nude images and criminalizes possession of child sexual abuse images generated with it. Broadly similar bills have also been introduced in Illinois, Montana, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Texas, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural.",
      "Maye Quade said she'll be sharing her proposal with legislators in other states because few are aware the technology is so readily accessible.",
      "\u201cIf we can\u2019t get Congress to act, then we can maybe get as many states as possible to take action,\u201d Maye Quade said.",
      "Sandi Johnson, senior legislative policy counsel for the victim\u2019s rights group RAINN \u2014 the Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network \u2014 said the Minnesota bill would hold websites accountable.",
      "\u201cOnce the images are created, they can be posted anonymously, or rapidly widely disseminated, and become nearly impossible to remove,\u201d she testified recently.",
      "Megan Hurley also was horrified to learn someone had generated explicit images and video of her using a \u201cnudification\u201d site. She said she feels especially humiliated because she's a massage therapist, a profession that's already sexualized in some minds.",
      "\u201cIt is far too easy for one person to use their phone or computer and create convincing, synthetic, intimate imagery of you, your family, and friends, your children, your grandchildren,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cI do not understand why this technology exists and I find it abhorrent there are companies out there making money in this manner.\u201d",
      "However, two AI law experts \u2014 Wayne Unger of the Quinnipiac University School of Law and Riana Pfefferkorn of Stanford University's Institute of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence \u2014 said the Minnesota bill is too broadly constructed to survive a court challenge.",
      "Limiting the scope only to images of real children might help it withstand a First Amendment challenge since those are generally not protected, Pfefferkorn said. But she said it would still potentially conflict with a federal law that says you can't sue websites for content that users generate.",
      "\u201cIf Minnesota wants to go down this direction, they'll need to add a lot more clarity to the bill,\u201d Unger said. \u201cAnd they'll have to narrow what they mean by nudify and nudification.\u201d",
      "But Maye Quade said she thinks her legislation is on solid constitutional ground because it's regulating conduct, not speech.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A private lunar lander carrying a drill, vacuum and other experiments for NASA touched down on the moon Sunday, the latest in a string of companies looking to kickstart business on Earth's celestial neighbor ahead of astronaut missions.",
      "Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost lander descended from lunar orbit on autopilot, aiming for the slopes of an ancient volcanic dome in an impact basin on the moon\u2019s northeastern edge of the near side.",
      "Confirmation of successful touchdown came from the company's Mission Control outside Austin, Texas, following the action some 225,000 miles (360,000 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cYou all stuck the landing. We\u2019re on the moon,\u201d Firefly\u2019s Will Coogan, chief engineer for the lander, reported.",
      "An upright and stable landing makes Firefly \u2014 a startup founded a decade ago \u2014 the first private outfit to put a spacecraft on the moon without crashing or falling over. Even countries have faltered, with only five claiming success: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan.",
      "A half hour after landing, Blue Ghost started to send back pictures from the surface, the first one a selfie somewhat obscured by the sun's glare. The second shot included the home planet, a blue dot glimmering in the blackness of space.",
      "Two other companies\u2019 landers are hot on Blue Ghost\u2019s heels, with the next one expected to join it on the moon later this week.",
      "Blue Ghost \u2014 named after a rare U.S. species of fireflies \u2014 had its size and shape going for it. The squat four-legged lander stands 6-foot-6 (2 meters) tall and 11 feet (3.5 meters) wide, providing extra stability, according to the company.",
      "Launched in mid-January from Florida, the lander carried 10 experiments to the moon for NASA. The space agency paid $101 million for the delivery, plus $44 million for the science and tech on board. It\u2019s the third mission under NASA\u2019s commercial lunar delivery program, intended to ignite a lunar economy of competing private businesses while scouting around before astronauts show up later this decade.",
      "Firefly\u2019s Ray Allensworth said the lander skipped over hazards including boulders to land safely. Allensworth said the team continued to analyze the data to figure out the lander's exact position, but all indications suggest it landed within the 328-foot (100-meter) target zone in Mare Crisium.",
      "The demos should get two weeks of run time, before lunar daytime ends and the lander shuts down.",
      "It carried a vacuum to suck up moon dirt for analysis and a drill to measure temperature as deep as 10 feet (3 meters) below the surface. Also on board: a device for eliminating abrasive lunar dust \u2014 a scourge for NASA\u2019s long-ago Apollo moonwalkers, who got it caked all over their spacesuits and equipment.",
      "On its way to the moon, Blue Ghost beamed back exquisite pictures of the home planet. The lander continued to stun once in orbit around the moon, with detailed shots of the moon's gray pockmarked surface. At the same time, an on-board receiver tracked and acquired signals from the U.S. GPS and European Galileo constellations, an encouraging step forward in navigation for future explorers.",
      "The landing set the stage for a fresh crush of visitors angling for a piece of lunar business.",
      "Another lander \u2014 a tall and skinny 15-footer (4 meters tall) built and operated by Houston-based Intuitive Machines \u2014 is due to land on the moon Thursday. It\u2019s aiming for the bottom of the moon, just 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the south pole. That\u2019s closer to the pole than the company got last year with its first lander, which broke a leg and tipped over.",
      "Despite the tumble, Intuitive Machines' lander put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.",
      "A third lander from the Japanese company ispace is still three months from landing. It shared a rocket ride with Blue Ghost from Cape Canaveral on Jan. 15, taking a longer, windier route. Like Intuitive Machines, ispace is also attempting to land on the moon for the second time. Its first lander crashed in 2023.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage not only from ispace, but dozens of other failed attempts over the decades.",
      "NASA wants to keep up a pace of two private lunar landers a year, realizing some missions will fail, said the space agency's top science officer Nicky Fox.",
      "\u201cIt really does open up a whole new way for us to get more science to space and to the moon,\" Fox said.",
      "Unlike NASA\u2019s successful Apollo moon landings that had billions of dollars behind them and ace astronauts at the helm, private companies operate on a limited budget with robotic craft that must land on their own, said Firefly CEO Jason Kim.",

      "Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses.",
      "Last year, a spacecraft built by Intuitive Machines through a NASA-sponsored program put the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since the end of the Apollo program, but the lander ended up tipping on its side and operated briefly on the surface.",
      "Now another U.S. company \u2014 Firefly Aerospace \u2014 on Sunday added its lunar lander to the win list, becoming the first private entity to pull off a fully successful moon landing.",
      "Both U.S. businesses are part of NASA\u2019s effort to support commercial deliveries to the moon ahead of astronaut missions later this decade.",
      "The moon is littered with wreckage from failed landings over the years. A rundown on the moon\u2019s winners and losers:",
      "The Soviet Union\u2019s Luna 9 successfully touches down on the moon in 1966, after its predecessors crash or miss the moon altogether. The U.S. follows four months later with Surveyor 1. Both countries achieve more robotic landings, as the race heats up to land men.",
      "NASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11\u2019s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972. Still the only country to send humans to the moon, the U.S. hopes to return crews to the surface by the end of 2026 or so, a year after a lunar fly-around by astronauts.",
      "China, in 2013, becomes the third country to successfully land on the moon, delivering a rover named Yutu, Chinese for jade rabbit. China follows with the Yutu-2 rover in 2019, this time touching down on the moon\u2019s unexplored far side \u2014 an impressive first. A sample return mission on the moon\u2019s near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission from the far side in 2024 delivers rocks and soil from the less explored part of the moon . Seen as NASA\u2019s biggest moon rival, China aims to put its astronauts on the moon by 2030.",
      "In 2023, Russia tries for its first moon landing in nearly a half-century, but the Luna 25 spacecraft smashes into the moon. The country\u2019s previous lander \u2014 1976\u2019s Luna 24 \u2014 not only landed, but returned moon rocks to Earth.",
      "After its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russia\u2019s crash-landing.",
      "Japan becomes the fifth country to land successfully on the moon, with its spacecraft touching down in January. The craft lands on the wrong side, compromising its ability to generate solar power, but manages to crank out pictures and science before falling silent when the long lunar night sets in.",
      "A privately funded lander from Israel, named Beresheet, Hebrew for \u201cin the beginning,\u201d crashes into the moon in 2019. A Japanese entrepreneur\u2019s company, ispace, launches a lunar lander in 2023, but it, too, wrecks.",
      "Intuitive Machines becomes the first private outfit to achieve a safe moon landing. The lander tipped over on its side in 2024, but worked briefly with limited communications. Another U.S. company \u2014 Astrobotic Technology \u2014 tried to send a lander to the moon the same year, but had to give up because of a fuel leak, eventually returning to Earth and burning up over the Pacific.",
      "There's another private rush to the moon this year after Firefly landed Blue Ghost, delivering experiments for NASA. Intuitive Machines and ispace also plan more moon deliveries.",

      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged \u201cno pause\u201d in pressure on Moscow.",
      "LONDON -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said there can be \"no pause\" in pressure on Russia after another night of missile and drone strikes across Ukraine, the latest barrage coming the day after the U.S. confirmed it had stopped sharing intelligence with Kyiv.",
      "President Donald Trump's decision to pause all U.S. military aid and intelligence sharing has raised concerns that Ukraine's air defenses will become less effective in the days, weeks and months to come.",
      "The pause followed last week's explosive Oval Office meeting between Zelenskyy and Trump. White House officials have suggested the freeze may be lifted if Ukraine takes concrete steps towards a peace deal with Russia to end Moscow's 3-year-old invasion.",
      "Ukraine's air force reported 112 drones and two missiles launched into the country overnight, with 68 drones shot down and 43 lost in flight.",
      "The air force reported damage in the Kharkiv, Sumy, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk regions.",
      "In Dnipropetrovsk, a ballistic missile hit a hotel in the city of Kryvyi Rih -- Zelenskyy's hometown.",
      "\"A ballistic missile struck an ordinary hotel,\" the president wrote on social media. Four people were killed with more than 30 others injured, he added. The attack came shortly after a group of foreign humanitarian volunteers checked into the hotel, Zelenskyy said. None were hurt.",
      "Sources told ABC News that two U.S. citizens were among the volunteers who survived the strike, working for the Charity fund Freedom Trust and Ukraine Relief organization.",
      "\"There must be no pause in the pressure on Russia to stop this war and terror against life,\" Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "Russian missiles and drone attacks are a nightly occurrence in Ukraine. The country has become largely reliant on Western anti-air weapons to defeat incoming projectiles.",
      "U.S. intelligence sharing with Ukraine had allowed Kyiv to give warnings to targeted areas ahead of Russian drone and missile strikes, tracking Russian aircraft taking off, drones being launched and missiles being fired.",
      "A Ukrainian intelligence official told ABC News on Wednesday that the intelligence sharing pause included a halt in sharing U.S. satellite imagery through the Defense Intelligence Agency.",
      "Zelenskyy is expected to travel to Brussels, Belgium, to meet with European leaders on Thursday, as he seeks further Western military and political support. The president has consistently requested more air defenses, an issue now more pressing amid the U.S. aid freeze.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said Wednesday that Trump had asked for a \"pause\" and is committed to peace. The pause, Ratcliffe suggested, prompted Zelenskyy's statement that he was ready to revive talks over a potential peace deal.",
      "\"And so I think on the military front and the intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen, I think will go away,\" he added.",
      "Trump has repeatedly -- and falsely -- blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia while seeking to undermine Zelenskyy's legitimacy as president. The White House is pushing Kyiv to accept a deal to end the fighting and to sign an agreement giving the U.S. access to Ukrainian mineral resources.",
      "In a Tuesday statement, Zelenskyy said the disastrous White House meeting was \"regrettable.\"",
      "\"Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,\" the president said. \"Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.\"",

    "summary": "More than 100 federal lawsuits have been filed since the inauguration, taking aim at Trump administration policies.",
    "story": [
      "Trump has been sued three times for every business day since the inauguration.",
      "As Donald Trump seeks to reshape the federal government at breakneck speed, his administration has encountered a flood of litigation challenging the legality of its early actions in office.",
      "With more than 100 federal lawsuits filed since the inauguration, Trump and his administration have effectively been sued three times for every business day he has occupied the Oval Office.",
      "Approximately 30 of the 100 lawsuits relate to Trump's immigration policies, while more than 20 of the cases directly challenge the actions of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. Ten of the cases challenge Trump policies relating to transgender people, and more than 20 cases oppose the president's unilateral changes to federal funding, government hiring and the structure of agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "With Trump signing more than 75 executive orders since taking office, the unprecedented flood of litigation has yielded mixed results in blocking the president's unilateral efforts to reshape the federal government. His attempts to freeze funding or rewrite longstanding laws have generally been blocked, but some federal judges have implicitly given him the green light to carry out part of his plan to reshape the federal workforce.",
      "U.S. District Judge John Coughenour -- who was nominated to the bench by Ronald Reagan -- handed the Trump administration one of its first legal defeats by blocking Trump's executive order on birthright citizenship and offered one of the fiercest criticisms of his presidency's early actions.",
      "\"It has become ever more apparent that to our president, the rule of law is but an impediment to his policy goals,\" Judge Coughenour said. \"There are moments in the world's history when people look back and ask, 'Where were the lawyers, where were the judges? In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.\"",
      "But other judges have stopped short of fully blocking policies they believe might be unlawful, demonstrating how a slower-moving judiciary can be outpaced by a rapidly moving administration. In a case challenging the Trump administration's effort to fire thousands of probationary employees, U.S. District Judge William Alsup rebuked the administration's actions but did not step in to stop the indiscriminate firing of employees, despite acknowledging its ongoing harm.",
      "\"That's just not right in our country \u2013 that we run our agencies with lies like that and stain somebody's record for the rest of their life? Who is going to want to work in a government that would do that to them? Probationary employees are the lifeblood of our government,\" he said.",
      "The number of lawsuits appear to have tested the limits of the court's ability to hear emergency applications, particularly in the District Court in D.C., where 51 of the cases have been brought. During one contentious hearing, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes threatened to sanction a lawyer who pushed the court to accept an emergency appeal while court staff had been \"working around the clock on really monumental time sensitive issues,\" Reyes said.",
      "\"Why on earth could you not have figured that out with the defendants before coming and burdening me and burdening the defendants and burning my staff on this issue?\" Reyes told Seth Waxman, a former U.S. Solicitor General under President Bill Clinton who is now representing eight former inspectors general fired by Trump.",
      "Lawsuits challenging the Trump administration have reached the Supreme Court twice, and the Department of Justice has begun their appeals to the Circuit Court in approximately a dozen cases.",
      "While no judge has found that the president has openly defied a court order, the Trump administration has found itself in hot water for failing to comply with multiple court orders, including orders to stop unilaterally freezing funding to states and holding back more than $1.9 billion in foreign aid.",
      "On Wednesday, the Supreme Court narrowly denied the Trump administration's request to block that payment, marking the first time during this administration that the Supreme Court ruled against the president who nominated three of the court's nine justices. In a dissenting opinion, Justice Samuel Alito remarked that he was \"stunned\" by the decision.",
      "\"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars? The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise,\" Alito said.",
      "Alito\u2019s criticism comes as Trump\u2019s allies including Vice President JD Vance and Elon Musk have criticized the power of judiciary to slow some of the administration\u2019s agenda. Vance publicly suggested defying a court order, and Musk is increasingly calling for the judges who block the administration to be impeached.",
      "\u201cThe only way to restore rule of the people in America is to impeach judges. No one is above the law, including judges,\u201d Musk said in a recent post on X.",
      "While the first two months of the Trump administration has yielded a torrent of lawsuits, the cases themselves are expected to take months and potentially years to play out as the courts weigh the limits of Trump's authority.",

      "The Hamas militant group has brushed off President Donald Trump\u2019s latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip",
      "CAIRO -- The Hamas militant group on Thursday brushed off President Donald Trump's latest threat and reiterated that it will only free the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Hamas accused Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to back out of the ceasefire agreement they reached in January. The agreement calls for negotiations over a second phase in which the hostages would be released in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners, a permanent ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "Hamas spokesman Abdel-Latif al-Qanoua said the \u201cbest path to free the remaining Israeli hostages\u201d is through negotiations on that phase, which were supposed to begin in early February. Only limited preparatory talks have been held so far.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump issued what he said was a \u201clast warning\u201d to Hamas after meeting with eight former hostages. The White House meanwhile confirmed it had held unprecedented direct talks with the militant group, which Israel and Western countries view as a terrorist organization.",
      "\u201cRelease all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \u201cOnly sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!\u201d",
      "Both Israel and Hamas have a longstanding practice of holding onto the remains of their adversaries in order to trade them in hostage-prisoner deals.",
      "Hamas is believed to still have 24 living hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war, including Israeli-American Edan Alexander. It is also holding the bodies of 34 others who were either killed in the initial attack or in captivity, as well as the remains of a soldier killed in the 2014 war.",
      "Hamas released 25 Israeli hostages and the bodies of eight more in exchange for nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in the first, 42-day phase of the ceasefire, which ended on Saturday.",
      "Israel supports what it says is a new U.S. plan for the second phase in which Hamas would release half the remaining hostages immediately and the rest when a permanent ceasefire is negotiated. Hamas has rejected the proposal and says it is sticking with the agreement signed in January.",
      "Israel has cut off the delivery of food, fuel, medicine and other supplies to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians in an attempt to pressure Hamas into accepting the new arrangement. It has threatened \u201cadditional consequences\u201d if Hamas does not resume the release of hostages.",
      "It's unclear if the U.S.-Hamas talks made any progress. The Trump administration has pledged full support for Israel's main war goals of returning all the hostages and eradicating Hamas, which may be incompatible.",
      "Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and took a total of 251 people hostage. Most have been released in ceasefire agreements or other arrangements. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages and recovered the bodies of dozens more.",
      "Israel's military offensive has killed over 48,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.",
      "The offensive destroyed vast areas in Gaza and displaced most of its population. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in tents, schools-turned-shelters or war-damaged buildings, and the population relies on international aid.",

      "President Donald Trump is expected to take the extraordinary step this week of directing his secretary of education to dissolve the U.S. Department of Education by executive order, according to sources familiar with a draft.",
      "A draft of the executive order calls on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate a department closure by taking all necessary steps \"permitted by law,\" the sources said.",
      "However, such a move would require congressional approval; any proposed legislation would likely fail without 60 Senate votes.",
      "McMahon has previously acknowledged she would need Congress to carry out the president's vision to close the department she's been tapped to lead.",
      "\"We'd like to do this right,\" she said during her confirmation hearing last month, adding: \"That certainly does require congressional action.\"",
      "The move has been months in the making, helping the president inch one step closer to fulfilling his campaign promise of returning education to the states.",
      "The draft is clear about the necessity to do so, sources said.",
      "\"The Federal bureaucratic hold on education must end,\" a draft of the president's executive order stated, according to those familiar with the document. \"The Department of Education's main functions can, and should, be returned to the States.\"",
      "McMahon is also compelled by the draft to allocate federal funding for education programs subject to rigorous compliance with the law and administration policy.",
      "\"The experiment of controlling American education through Federal programs and dollars - - and the unaccountable bureaucrats those programs and dollars support - - has failed our children, our teachers, and our families,\" the draft said, according to sources.",
      "However, critics argued that the department provides vital financial assistance and grant programs. It holds schools accountable for enforcing nondiscrimination laws for gender, race and disability -- specifically, Title IX, Title VI and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Americans with Disabilities Act.",
      "Closing the agency would \u201creally cripple the ability to function and aid the support that these students need to really succeed from an academic standpoint,\u201d Augustus Mays, vice president for partnerships and engagement at the advocacy group The Education Trust, told ABC News.",
      "Education experts suggested that shuttering the ED could gut public education funding and disproportionately impact high-need students across the country who rely on statutorily authorized programs, such as the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and Title I, which provides funding for low-income families.",
      "An end to the department could also leave billions of dollars' worth of funds, scholarships and grants hanging in the balance for millions of students in the U.S.",
      "The draft also instructed any program or activity receiving federal funding to \"terminate\" its diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, citing concerns for race- and sex-based discrimination.",
      "The draft's circulation comes just days after the agency launched EndDEI.Ed.Gov, a website that allows users to submit discrimination-focused complaints and aims to strictly enforce the Title VI civil rights law in schools.",
      "The current version of the executive order blasted education spending that does not correlate with adequate results on exams like the National Assessment of Educational Progress, which has been dubbed \"the nation's report card,\" sources said.",
      "Meanwhile, it directed McMahon to return decision-making authority to parents and families in order to improve the \"education, well-being, and future success\" of the nation's children.",
      "McMahon allies believe that her experience as the CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment will aid her in being an agent of change, a disrupter and the dismantler that the department needs.",
      "In a department-wide email on Monday, the newly sworn-in secretary said her final mission is to do a \"historic overhaul\" of the agency that cuts red tape and restores the American education system.",
      "\"My vision is aligned with the President's: to send education back to the states and empower all parents to choose an excellent education for their children,\" McMahon's memo said.",
      "Dozens of ED employees have already been placed on paid administrative leave, pressured to retire or laid off in the first few months of Trump's second term.",

    "story": [
      "GOP Rep. Dan Newhouse called Green's outburst \"unacceptable.\"",
      "The House will move forward with a final vote to censure Democratic Rep. Al Green Thursday morning after his disruptions during President Donald Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night.",
      "Democrats fell short of blocking the effort by a vote of 209-211-1.",
      "On Wednesday morning, several members of the GOP conference were circulating different resolutions to censure Green, who was ejected from the House chamber after interrupting Trump's remarks multiple times.",
      "Republican Rep. Dan Newhouse was the first to formally introduce a resolution on the House floor on Wednesday.",
      "\"Decorum and order are the institutional grounds for the way we do business in the United States Congress, and the sheer disregard for that standard during President Trump's address by the gentleman from Texas is unacceptable,\" Newhouse said in a statement. \"A Member's refusal to adhere to the Speaker's direction to cease such behavior, regardless of their party, has and will continue to be reprimanded in the people's House.\"",
      "A censure resolution is a formal reprimand by the House for violations of the chamber's code of conduct. A vote to censure a member of the House does not hold any power beyond a public condemnation of the member's behavior and it does not deny the member privileges.",
      "It requires a simple majority for passage. Censuring House members has been historically rare, but in the last few years we've seen members from both political parties use this as a political tool.",
      "Green would become the fifth member of Congress to be censured in this decade.",
      "Green on Wednesday defended his actions on the House floor last night, saying, \"I would do it again.\"",
      "\"I am not angry with the speaker. I am not angry with the officers. I am not upset with the members who are going to bring the motions or resolutions to sanction. I will suffer the consequences,\" he said.",
      "Green's outburst happened within minutes of Trump's address, when the president called his electoral victory a \"mandate.\"",
      "Green, an 11-term Democrat representing the Houston area, stood up and pointed his cane as he shouted, \"You have no mandate to cut Medicaid.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson slammed his gavel and gave a warning to lawmakers assembled to maintain decorum, telling Green several times to take his seat. As Green continued to protest, Johnson called for him to be removed.",
      "Johnson said after Trump's address that Green should be censured and that he would \"absolutely\" put a resolution on the floor after its introduction. He told reporters, \"it's a spectacle that was not necessary. He's made history in a terrible way. And I hope he enjoys it.\"",
      "On \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday morning, Johnson also defended his decision to have Green removed.",
      "\"Al Green was trying to interrupt the entire proceeding. But look, I'll just say this. If the Democrats want a 77-year-old congressman to be the face of their resistance, heckling the president, then bring it on,\" he said.",
      "Green told ABC News late Tuesday night he was \"following the wishes of conscience.\"",
      "\"There are times when it it better to stand alone than not stand at all,\" Green said. He added, \"At some point, we're all going to have to stand up.\"",
      "Green said as of Wednesday afternoon, he hadn't spoke to Democratic leadership about the incident as he's been mourning the loss of Texas Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:56:15 -0500",
    "summary": "During an address to Congress on Tuesday night, Trump said childhood cancer rates have increase by 40%. Data shows there may be some context missing.",
    "story": [
      "While rates have been increasing, mortality has decreased.",
      "During his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, President Donald Trump spoke about childhood cancer rates, saying it was a priority of his administration to tackle this issue.",
      "\"Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40 percent,\" Trump said during his speech. \"Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\"",
      "The president also took time to highlight a 13-year-old brain cancer survivor, whom he invited as a special guest to attend his address.",
      "Although it's unclear where Trump got the 40% figure, data shows that childhood cancer rates have indeed been increasing over the past several decades. However, a pediatric oncologist told ABC News that there's important context missing in that statement, such as the effect of advances in early detection and possible environmental factors.",
      "\"It's accurate to say that these diagnoses have gone up in the tracking data,\" Dr. John Prensner, an assistant professor of pediatrics and of biological chemistry in the department of cancer biology at the University of Michigan School of Medicine, told ABC News. \"I think the context for these numbers is incredibly important and that's what I think has been left out, perhaps, of the conversation.\"",
      "Additionally, childhood cancer treatments have been improving and the number of childhood cancer survivors is increasing, Prensner said.",
      "A study published early this year in the journal PLOS One that was conducted by researchers in the U.S., Germany and Jordan found that childhood cancer rates in America have increased by approximately 33% since 1975.",
      "The study found that the incidence of childhood cancer rose from 14.23 cases per 100,000 children between 1975 and 1979 to about 18.89 cases per 100,00 children between 2010 and 2019.",
      "The increase was found in certain types of cancer including leukemias, lymphomas, brain tumors, hepatic tumors, and gonadal germ cell tumors, according to the study.",
      "Additionally, a report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency found that over the past 40 years, the number of children diagnosed with leukemia has increased by about 35%.",
      "These trends mirror what has been seen in older populations, with cancer rates also increasing in adults under age 50.",
      "Prensner said scientists believe there are many likely reasons why childhood cancer rates are increasing.",
      "One reason is better detection and the dramatic improvement in medical tests over the past several decades, according to Prensner, who said many of the tests that are now commonly used didn't exist 50 years ago.",
      "\"These include dramatic, dramatic improvements in the ways that we can image patients with CAT scans and MRI scans,\" Prensner told ABC News. \"This includes improvements in the way that we monitor and screen certain patients. We have much more information now about patients who may have what's called a cancer syndrome, meaning they're at a higher risk to develop cancer.\"",
      "\"In those patients, we actively monitor them to be able to make early diagnoses before cancers are able to spread, and so those patients may not have been monitored in prior decades because we didn't have that scientific information,\" he added.",
      "Prensner said he is not an expert in the risk of cancer from environmental exposures but that data suggests those factors may also be playing a role in the increase of childhood cancer rates.",
      "A study from March 2024 that analyzed over 200 previous studies found that exposure to pesticides, hazardous air pollutants, chemicals like benzene, and vehicular emissions has been linked to higher rates of childhood cancers, particularly leukemia.",
      "While childhood cancer rates have increased, childhood cancer mortality rates have significantly declined over the past decades. Between 2001 and 2021, the cancer death rate for U.S. children and teens aged 19 and younger decreased by 24%, from 2.75 to 2.10 per 100,000 individuals, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Prensner said there are close to 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S., many of whom are now adults, indicating that more children are surviving cancer, likely due to advancements in medical treatments and early detection.",
      "\"There are some types of childhood cancers that are associated with congenital anomalies or birth defects, and patients who are born with those different disorders also receive better care now, such that they may have a higher cancer rate now, because they're living longer, whereas they may not have lived nearly as long in 1980,\" Prensner said.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Lisa Lacasse, president of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said she was \"encouraged\" to see President Trump shine a light on childhood cancer rates.",
      "\"While pediatric cancer incidence has increased in the last few decades, the cancer mortality rate among children and adolescents younger than 20 years declined by more than 50% from 1975 to 2022, according to the National Cancer Institute; though lasting effects from treatment persist,\" Lacasse said. \"This progress in survival has been possible thanks to investments in research and breakthroughs in treatment.\"",

    "story": [
      "The mayors pushed back on GOP assertions that they are welcoming criminals.",
      "The Democratic mayors of Boston, Chicago, Denver and New York City on Wednesday pushed back against House Republicans' claims that they are harboring dangerous immigrants and violating immigration laws as so-called \"sanctuary cities.\"",
      "During a House Oversight Committee hearing on Wednesday, Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, Denver Mayor Mike Johnston and New York City Mayor Eric Adams all defended their actions on immigration enforcement in their respective cities as Republicans on the committee accused them of increasing crime and impeding on law enforcement actions.",
      "Chairman James Comer, a Republican, said these mayors lead towns that have policies that only create \"sanctuary for criminals\" and promised to hold them accountable for \"their failure to follow the law and protect the American people.\" Comer and other Republicans on the committee suggested that the mayors should be doing more to cooperate with the Trump administration and its deportation efforts.",
      "Sanctuary cities still enforce U.S. federal immigration laws, but the term often refers to a limited collaboration with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement while enacting policies that are more favorable to undocumented people.",
      "\"As mayor, I do not control who enters or remains in our country, but I do have to manage the population that is within our city,\" said Adams, who said as New York City mayor he is working with the Trump administration on immigration aid. \"In order to carry out this function without having long term negative ramification, I must create an atmosphere that allows every law-abiding resident, documented or not, to access vital services without fear of being turned over to federal authorities.\"",
      "Wu said that the Trump administration is making \"hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives.\"",
      "\"A city that's scared is not a city that's safe. A land ruled by fear is not the land of the free,\" Wu said.",
      "Democrats immediately criticized the Trump administration, arguing the overreach of federal officials has led to unlawful detentions and created fear in communities.",
      "\"Let's be clear, the state and local laws that Republicans have issue with today are in full compliance with federal law. They do not obstruct ICE from carrying out its duties, and they are backed by evidence demonstrating that they keep people safe,\" Ranking Member Gerry Connolly said.",
      "Wednesday's committee hearing comes as President Donald Trump's administration officials have ramped up their immigration enforcement efforts with Attorney General Pam Bondi shutting down federal grants to sanctuary cities and multiple threats from \"border czar\" Tom Homan toward these mayors if they refuse to comply.",
      "At the Conservative Political Action Conference last month, Homan criticized Boston and its police commissioner, saying he'll be \"bringing hell\" to the city over its sanctuary city policy.",
      "\"Let's talk about Tom Homan,\" Wu said Wednesday. \"Shame on him for lying about my city, for having the nerve to insult our police commissioner who has overseen the safest Boston's been in anyone's lifetime. Bring him here under oath, and let's ask him some questions.\"",
      "The mayors pushed back heavily on assertions from Republicans that they are welcoming criminals into their cities, blaming the Trump administration for labeling immigrants as criminals and pushing misleading crime statistics.",
      "\"If you wanted to make us safe, pass gun reforms,\" Wu later added. \"Stop cutting Medicaid. Stop cutting cancer research. Stop cutting funds for veterans. That is what will make our cities safe.\"",
      "Many Republican lawmakers pointed to specific incidents in each of the mayor's cities about U.S. citizens getting injured or killed at the hands of undocumented people, attempting to dispel the mayors' arguments.",
      "Republican Rep. Jim Jordan got in a contentious back-and-forth with Johnston involving a Venezuelan gang member who injured officers during an arrest. Due to the state's sanctuary city policy, police were forced to arrest the man in public rather than travel into the jail to detain him, something the Republicans criticized.",
      "Republican Rep. Nancy Mace had harsh words for the mayors, saying \"you all have blood on your hands\" over deaths and injuries at the hands of these undocumented people.",
      "\"All of the mayors here today are actively working to harm the American people you represent,\" Mace said. \"You all have blood on your hands.\"",
      "As the committee members accused the mayors of interfering with Trump's deportation efforts, the mayors continued to assert that they were in compliance with federal law.",
      "However, Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna disputed the mayor's claims and argued that the sanctuary city policies were in violation of federal law, announcing she was going to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department.",
      "\"I do not think you guys are bad people, but I think that you are ideologically misled, which is why, unfortunately, based on your responses, I'm all going to be criminally referring you to the Department of Justice for investigation, and as soon as I leave here, these will be going over to Pam Bondi,\" Luna said.",
      "\"I'm not doing that ... [in] an effort to bully you guys, but I do believe that your policies are hurting the American people.\"",

      "It's not the first time that Green, who has represented Texas' 9th congressional district since 2005, has been a thorn in Trump's side.",
      "In May 2017, Green presented the first articles of impeachment against Trump, citing the firing of FBI Director James Comey. In July 2019, he called for Trump's impeachment again, citing the president's attack on four Democratic congresswomen of color. The house voted to table Green's resolution, effectively killing it.",

      "The group, who had previously been arrested for second-degree murder, were also accused of kidnapping and child endangerment in the 11-count indictment.",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- An avalanche in Alaska backcountry swept up and buried three skiers under a blanket of snow that could be as deep as a 10-story building, Alaska State Troopers said Wednesday.",
      "While troopers have not been able to assess the site yet, \u201cbased on the information provided by the operator, unfortunately, we do not believe that any of the three missing persons survived the avalanche,\" Austin McDaniel, a spokesperson for the Alaska State Troopers, said in a text to The Associated Press.",
      "If the deaths are confirmed it would be the deadliest U.S. avalanche since three climbers were killed in a slide in Washington\u2019s Cascade Mountains two years ago.",
      "The slide happened late Tuesday afternoon near the skiing community of Girdwood, located about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Anchorage, said McDaniel.",
      "Guides from the heli-skiing company attempted to locate the skiers. Using avalanche beacons, the guides identified a probable area where the skiers were buried, at a depth of 40 feet (12 meters) to 100 feet (30 meters), McDaniel said in a later email.",
      "\u201cThe guides were unable to recover the three skiers due to the depth. Due to considerable avalanche risk in this area and limited daylight, no further recovery operations were conducted on March 4,\u201d he said. \u201cIf weather and conditions allow for it, Troopers plan to assess avalanche conditions from the air and determine recovery options with individuals that have experience making avalanche recoveries.\"",
      "The avalanche site is 8 miles northeast of the airport in Girdwood.",
      "Girdwood is the skiing capital of Alaska, and home to the Alyeska Resort, at the base of Mount Alyeska, where people downhill ski or snowboard amid stunning views of Turnagain Arm. At the top of the mountain is the Seven Glaciers Restaurant, named for its view.",
      "Heli-skiing is using a helicopter to reach the top of a mountain in remote backcountry areas where there are no ski lifts, and a person either skis or snowboards down the mountain.",
      "Each winter, 25 to 30 people die in avalanches in the U.S., according to the National Avalanche Center.",
      "Fifteen people have been killed across the U.S. by avalanches so far this winter. Among them were 10 backcountry skiers or snowboarders, four people on snow machines and a ski patroller, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.",
      "Colorado experiences the most avalanche deaths, with 325 people killed since 1950. Alaska ranks second, with 172 deaths in that time period, according to the center.",
      "In 2021, Czech billionaire Petr Kellner and four others died in a helicopter crash during a heliskiing tour near Knik Glacier, in the Chugach Mountains just north of Anchorage. A year later, a heli-ski guide scouting an area for clients died when an avalanche carried his body nearly 1500 feet (457 meters) down a mountain, Alaska State Troopers said at the time.",
      "There have been several deaths reported elsewhere this year.",
      "One person was killed in an avalanche in central Colorado on Feb. 22. Authorities in Grand County responded to what they described as a skier-triggered avalanche in a steep area known as \u201cThe Fingers\u201d above Berthoud Pass. It was the second reported avalanche in the county that day.",
      "That avalanche death was the third in Colorado this winter and the second fatality in less than a week in that state, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center. A Crested Butte snowboarder was killed Feb. 20 in a slide west of Silverton.",
      "Elsewhere, three people died in avalanches Feb. 17 \u2014 one person near Lake Tahoe and two backcountry skiers in Oregon\u2019s Cascade Mountains. On Feb. 8, a well-known outdoor guide was caught in an avalanche in Utah and was killed.",

      "Officials say roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Roughly 650 Marines and Army soldiers who were forced out of the military for refusing to get the COVID-19 vaccine have so far expressed interest in returning to the force under an executive order from President Donald Trump, officials said this week.",
      "The number represents about 8% of the roughly 8,200 troops who had been discharged. The total, officials say, confirms military leaders' early view that many troops have moved on with their lives. They have been allowed to rejoin since 2023, and Trump's offer of providing back pay may be a factor in spurring a bit more interest now.",
      "The Army and Marine Corps have been sending out emails, texts and phone calls to service members discharged for refusing a pandemic-era order to get the vaccine. The Navy and the Air Force are planning to begin their efforts to contact service members, but are waiting for additional guidance. The totals would likely increase once their formal notices go out.",
      "Officials stressed that the numbers are very preliminary because troops have only expressed interest in reenlisting and haven't actually taken steps to formally do so. They will have to go through the enlistment procedure again, pass all required legal and moral standards and physical fitness requirements, and agree to reenlist for at least two years.",
      "Trump has argued that the vaccine mandate wrongly pushed troops out and suggested that many would return. In an executive order signed a week after he took office, Trump said that the mandate cost the military \u201csome of our best people\u201d and he vowed to \u201crehire every patriot who was fired from the military with \u2026 backpay.\u201d",
      "Under Trump's directive, those who were discharged for refusing the vaccine can rejoin and get back pay. Those who voluntarily left to avoid the vaccine also can rejoin, but they must swear that they left the service for that reason and they will not receive back pay.",
      "Two years ago, the military services sent out notices to all troops discharged for refusing the vaccine, advising them they could return to the military. Just 113 reenlisted.",
      "As a result of those notices:",
      "\u2014 Of the 3,748 Marines discharged, 25 opted to re-enlist.",
      "\u2014 Of the 1,903 Army soldiers discharged, 73 returned.",
      "\u2014 Of the 1,878 sailors discharged, two returned.",
      "\u2014 Of the 671 airmen discharged, 13 returned.",
      "In mid-February, the Defense Department told the military services to reach out once again to service members who were forced out or voluntarily left the military because of the COVID-19 vaccine and see if they want to reenlist. This time it came with the financial incentive.",
      "The Marine Corps set up a special team and has sent emails and text messages to those who were discharged. As of Wednesday, spokesman Jim Edwards said 553 Marines have responded. Of those, 455 expressed some interest in reenlisting or had additional questions about the offer, and 98 said they weren't interested.",
      "Col. Dave Butler, Army spokesman, said that more than half of the approximately 1,900 soldiers discharged have been contacted either by phone or email. And of those, about 200 have expressed interest in returning to the service.",
      "\u201cThe Army has been working hard to get in contact with all of the folks who were discharged due to COVID since the Executive Order was signed,\u201d Butler said. \u201cWe\u2019re using all mediums, the contact info we have on record, social media \u2014 we even have a hotline someone interested could call.\u201d",
      "The Navy and Air Force said they are waiting for more specific guidance on the process.",
      "According to officials, the services will compile a list of those interested in reenlisting or getting more information and will have to send them all details on what back pay they could receive and how to move forward.",
      "The Pentagon made the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory in August 2021 for all service members, including the National Guard and Reserve. Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said getting the vaccine was critical to maintaining a healthy force prepared to defend the nation.",

      "Georgia U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath has filed paperwork to raise money for a run for governor in 2026, becoming the first Democrat to take that step",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia U.S. Rep. Lucy McBath filed paperwork on Wednesday to raise money for a run for governor in 2026, becoming the first Democrat to take that step.",
      "McBath described her effort as an exploratory committee, although that could quickly become a full-blown campaign. The four-term member of Congress is best known as a gun control advocate.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp is completing his second term and can't run again. On the Republican side, Attorney General Chris Carr is already running for governor in 2026 and Lt. Gov. Burt Jones is widely expected to run.",
      "Other Democrats who have been exploring a run include former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves and former DeKalb County Chief Executive Officer Michael Thurmond. Democrat Stacey Abrams, who ran and lost to Kemp in 2018 and 2022, has not closed the door on a third run.",
      "McBath first won election to Congress in 2018, ousting Republican U.S. Rep Karen Handel to seize a seat in Atlanta's northern suburbs once held by Newt Gingrich. When Republicans redrew electoral districts after the 2020 Census, McBath jumped into a primary race against fellow Democrat Carolyn Bordeaux, beating her handily and winning election. Then after a court ordered another round of redistricting after finding African American votes were diluted, McBath shifted to a district Republicans drew on the western side of Atlanta.",
      "Those moves mean McBath has represented a much larger number of voters than the typical member of Congress, which could make her a stronger statewide candidate.",
      "McBath, like Abrams, would be bidding to become the first Black female governor of an American state. While that remains a difficult hurdle to cross, McBath is likely to have advantages as a Black woman in a Democratic primary in Georgia, where Black women are the backbone of the party.",
      "But McBath also tries to cultivate bipartisan appeal, especially with suburban swing voters. She was one of four Georgia Democrats earlier this year who voted for the Laken Riley Act, named for a 22-year-old Georgia nursing student who was killed last year by a Venezuelan man in the U.S. illegally. The law was the first that President Donald Trump signed in his second term and makes it easier to deport immigrants in the U.S. illegally who have been accused of crimes.",
      "\u201cGeorgians deserve a Governor who understands what\u2019s at stake \u2014 because they\u2019ve lived it,\u201d McBath said in a statement Thursday. \u201cAs a mom and breast cancer survivor, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how regular people are too often left out of the political process. I look forward to continuing this conversation with my neighbors and fellow Georgians.\u201d",
      "The 64-year-old McBath rose to prominence as a gun control advocate after her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was shot and killed in 2012 by a white man who was angry over the loud music the Black teenager and his friends were playing at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station. McBath, a former flight attendant, has had her political career heavily backed by billionaire and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.",
      "She touts her support of a 2022 law that toughens background checks for the youngest gun buyers, keeps firearms from more domestic violence offenders and helps states enact red flag laws making it easier for authorities to take weapons from people judged dangerous.",
      "McBath led a group of survivors and family members of victims of gun violence who spoke in a prime-time slot at the 2024 Democratic National Convention."

      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- The South Carolina Supreme Court has rejected what is likely the final appeal of condemned man Brad Sigmon, clearing the way for Friday's firing squad execution.",
      "Sigmon's lawyers wanted to delay his death so they could get a fuller hearing in court to learn more information about the drug South Carolina uses in lethal injections. Sigmon said that lack of information forced him to choose to be shot to death. The state also has an electric chair, but Sigmon said he didn't want to suffer being cooked alive by electricity.",
      "Sigmon's attorneys also argued that his lawyers in the original 2002 trial did a poor job of trying to save his life after he pleaded guilty by not submitting enough evidence of his mental problems.",
      "Sigmon, 67, beat his ex-girlfriend's parents to death with a baseball bat in their Greenville County home. His plan was to kidnap his ex-girlfriend, spend a romantic weekend together and then kill her and himself. She escaped from his car as he drove away.",
      "\"If I couldn\u2019t have her, I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody else have her. And I knew it got to the point where I couldn\u2019t have her,\u201d Sigmon said in a confession typed out by a detective after his arrest.",
      "Sigmon will be strapped into a chair at 6 p.m. Friday in the death chamber used for all South Carolina executions at Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia. A target will be placed over his heart and a hood over his head. Three shooters, all with live ammunition, will fire from 15 feet (4.6 meters) away.",
      "Sigmon would be the first inmate killed by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years.",
      "Lawyers for Sigmon said in court papers that he chose a violent death by firing squad because, without more information, he thought he would die a tortuous death if he picked lethal injection.",
      "Autopsies from two inmates executed in the months since South Carolina changed its method of lethal injection to massive amounts of pentobarbital showed a considerable amount of fluid in their lungs. A defense expert testified the inmates could have suffered struggling to breathe.",
      "But lawyers for the state have said fluid is often found in the lungs of prisoners killed by lethal injections and other courts have not ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. They also said witnesses at the executions, including the inmates' attorneys, did not report any breathing or signs of consciousness after about a minute.",
      "Prison officials also told the doctor conducting the autopsy that both Marion Bowman, who was executed on Jan. 31, and Richard Moore, executed on Nov. 1, needed twice the dose of the lethal injection drug typically used in other states and by the federal government.",
      "In Moore's case, two doses were given 11 minutes apart. In Bowman's execution, it wasn't clear the time range, although a witness heard talking 10 minutes after the execution began.",
      "\u201cThere is no justice here. Everything about this barbaric, state-sanctioned atrocity \u2014 from the choice to the method itself \u2014 is abjectly cruel. We should not just be horrified \u2014 we should be furious,\u201d defense attorney Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King said in a statement,",
      "South Carolina has a shield law that keeps the suppliers of its lethal injection drugs, the members of the execution team and the procedure used to kill an inmate secret, so it isn't known if South Carolina's new protocol requires two doses of pentobarbital.",
      "Sigmon also plans to ask Republican Gov. Henry McMaster to commute his death sentence to life in prison. His lawyers said he is a model prisoner trusted by guards and works every day to atone for the killings he committed after succumbing to severe mental illness.",
      "McMaster will make his decision moments before the execution starts. No South Carolina governor has granted clemency in the 49 years since the death penalty restarted."

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A suspected thief gulped down two pairs of diamond earrings during his arrest on the side of a Florida Panhandle highway last week, detectives say, leaving them with the unenviable task of waiting to \u201ccollect\u201d the Tiffany & Co. jewelry worth nearly $770,000.",
      "An X-ray of the suspect's torso showed what the Orlando Police Department believed to be the diamond earrings \u2014 a white mass shining brightly against the grey backdrop of his digestive tract.",
      "\u201cThese foreign objects are suspected to be the Tiffany & Co earrings taken in the robbery but will need to be collected ... after they are passed,\u201d the department's arrest report said. Handwriting on an order of commitment document filed Monday said \u201coutside medical,\u201d suggesting he was at a medical facility.",
      "The 32-year-old man from Texas is accused of forcibly stealing the earrings from an upscale Orlando shopping center last Wednesday.",
      "Orlando police spokeswoman Kaylee Bishop said Wednesday she was checking with the lead detective on whether the earrings had been recovered yet. The earrings\u2019 status also wasn\u2019t known to a deputy who answered the phone but wouldn\u2019t give his name in the rural Panhandle county where the suspect was arrested near Chipley, Florida.",
      "During the theft, the man allegedly told Tiffany sales associates he was interested in purchasing diamond earrings and a diamond ring on behalf of an Orlando Magic basketball player. Sales associates escorted the man to a VIP room where he could view the jewelry. A short time later, he jumped out of his chair, grabbed the jewelry and tried to force his way out of the door.",
      "One of the sales associates was injured trying to block him but managed to knock the diamond ring, valued at $587,000, out of his hands.",
      "Detectives obtained the license plate of the suspect\u2019s car through shopping mall security footage and believe he was driving back to Texas. State troopers tracked the car from tag readers on the Florida Turnpike and Interstate 10 until he was pulled over for driving without rear lights in Washington County, almost 340 miles (550 kilometers) away, the Orlando police report said.",
      "As he was being taken into custody, he swallowed several items troopers believed were the earrings.",
      "The suspect was charged with first-degree felony grand theft and robbery with a mask, a third-degree felony. Court records showed no attorney for him, and he was listed as being in police custody in Orange County Florida, which is home to Orlando, as of Wednesday morning.",

      "NEW YORK -- Lindsey Boylan helped drive Andrew Cuomo from office in 2021 when the former aide came forward as the first woman to accuse the governor of sexual harassment.",
      "At the time she had allies in high places: Every New York Democrat in Congress, the state's legislative leaders and then-President Joe Biden all condemned Cuomo's behavior and said he should resign.",
      "But now that Cuomo is back as a serious contender in the race to be mayor of New York City, many of those top Democrats have little to say about his candidacy.",
      "To Boylan, that feels like a betrayal \u2014 one that can't simply be explained away as an easing of #MeToo outrage.",
      "\u201cIf anything has changed, momentarily, it\u2019s that across our country, across issues, people who should be speaking up, aren\u2019t,\" Boylan, who served in the Cuomo administration for three years, said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think anything has specifically changed with women being angry about how our rights are being taken away,\" she said. \"But the fact that most of our leaders are more interested in staying comfortable and staying in their jobs than actually protecting us and defending us. That\u2019s gotten much worse.\u201d",
      "Cuomo resigned in 2021 after a report released by the state attorney general concluded that he had sexually harassed 11 women, including Boylan.",
      "Now, Cuomo is a frontrunner in the mayoral race, even as state and party leaders, while not warm to his candidacy, haven\u2019t condemned it either.",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who as Cuomo\u2019s lieutenant governor had called his alleged behavior with women \u201crepulsive and unlawful,\u201d said Tuesday she stood by those comments. But, she added, she had to \u201cdeal in the reality today.\"",
      "\u201cI have to go forward in light of where we are today and deal with whatever the voters decide to deal with,\u201d she said, adding that she would work with Cuomo if he was elected.",
      "U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand said on the NY1 television station that Cuomo made mistakes, but was also a talented executive who did good things as governor. It was up to New York City voters whether he deserved a second chance, she said, declining to give her own opinion on his candidacy.",
      "U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House minority leader, said last week that he would not endorse a candidate until after the city\u2019s June primary. The office of U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declined to comment.",
      "That Cuomo is a credible candidate is likely due to a mix of factors, experts said. These include the former governor's aggressive effort to discredit his accusers and his deep record of accomplishments as governor, as well as a field of mayoral candidates with little name recognition and an ongoing sense of disorder at City Hall.",
      "Mayor Eric Adams, the incumbent, was indicted in September on federal corruption charges and is now dealing with a tempest of criticism after President Donald Trump\u2019s newly installed Justice Department leaders asked a court to drop the case so Adams could assist with the federal government\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "In a statement, a Cuomo spokesperson, Rich Azzopardi, said multiple prosecutors have dug into the allegations the former governor sexually harassed women and none have sought to pursue the cases.",
      "\u201cThree years, five district attorney reviews that resulted in zero cases and civil cases that were either dropped or are dying on the vine,\u201d Azzopardi said, calling that \u201ca clarifying dose of due process.\u201d",
      "New York City \"is in crisis and everybody knows that Andrew Cuomo has the experience, the record and the skill to help save it,\" he added.",
      "Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University, said the current mayor's legal and political troubles help place Cuomo at the front of the pack of candidates.",
      "\u201cNew York is in such a state of chaos and the government needs someone to come in and take charge and run the show. He is well-matched for that moment,\" he said.",
      "Not to Boylan, though, who joined a demonstration outside a Cuomo campaign fundraising event on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cHis path to victory is to destroy the women he abused,\u201d she told the AP. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything within my power and my sense of ethics to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d",
      "Boylan, who said she was subjected to an unwanted kiss and inappropriate comments from Cuomo, was disappointed but not surprised that other Democrats in New York had not spoken out more forcefully.",
      "\u201cThe most powerful people in New York politics are afraid of him,\" she said.",
      "Other female ex-aides described fielding kisses \u2014 sometimes on the lips \u2014 and sexually charged questions and remarks from him about their personal lives and appearance.",
      "A staffer at a state-related agency said he groped her rear while they posed for a photo. A state Health Department doctor was affronted by his comments, such as \u201cyou make that gown look good,\u201d while she gave him a COVID-19 test at a news conference. Another woman described Cuomo planting an unwanted kiss on her face when she met him at a wedding.",
      "One aide, Brittany Commisso, filed a criminal complaint accusing Cuomo of groping her breast while they were alone in an office at the governor's mansion, but a local district attorney declined to prosecute, citing lack of sufficient evidence.",
      "Cuomo apologized for having \u201coffended\u201d the women with remarks he said were intended to be collegial, and allowed that he sometimes had been \u201ctoo familiar\u201d with people. But he denied touching anyone inappropriately and said the investigation of his conduct was flawed and politically motivated.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James, the Democrat who commissioned the sexual harassment investigation, herself briefly ran for governor in 2021 after Cuomo resigned, but dropped out after two months.",
      "Cuomo's lawyers and representatives have since fought to vindicate him amid multiple lawsuits from his accusers. Cuomo even has indicated he plans to file a defamation suit against one of the women, former aide Charlotte Bennett.",
      "Despite the accusations, Cuomo has lined up some endorsements from women in politics. City Council Member Kamillah Hanks, a Staten Island Democrat, said in her statement endorsing Cuomo that the \u201cunprecedented times\u201d called for a \u201cstrong, unapologetic\u201d leader.",
      "Trump, who has himself been accused of sexual misconduct and was found liable in 2023 by a New York City jury for sexual abuse, charges he denied, has also reshaped the idea of what is acceptable conduct for public officials, said Leigh Gilmore, a professor emeritus at Ohio State University and author of \u201cThe #MeToo Effect: What Happens When We Believe Women.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe political winds have shifted with Trump being in office, where it\u2019s not agreed anymore that those are disqualifying allegations,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A group backed by billionaire Elon Musk is behind a new set of deceptive attack ads and text messages targeting voters just weeks ahead of the election for a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A group backed by billionaire Elon Musk is behind a set of deceptive attack ads and text messages targeting voters just weeks ahead of the election for a seat on Wisconsin\u2019s Supreme Court, employing a battleground state strategy it used last year against Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.",
      "The ads are labeled as coming from a group called Progress 2028 and are made to look like authentic messages of support for Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford, who is backed by Democrats. They describe her as a \u201cprogressive champion\u201d who will \u201cstand up for immigrants,\u201d defend Planned Parenthood and promote a justice system that gives criminals \u201csecond chances.\u201d",
      "But records show the ads that appear on Facebook and Instagram and in text messages to some voters are underwritten by Building America\u2019s Future. That\u2019s a national conservative group that counts Musk among its biggest donors, a Wall Street Journal report revealed.",
      "The ads largely hew to the facts in Crawford\u2019s background but focus on hot-button issues such as abortion, immigration and criminal justice reform. They call for Crawford to \u201cboldly proclaim her progressive values,\u201d language that potentially diminishes her standing with moderate or conservative voters in a race that is \u2014 at least officially \u2014 nonpartisan.",
      "The new collection of ads is the latest example of how Musk\u2019s extraordinary wealth has been used to promote the Republican Party\u2019s political interests, including in a contest for ideological control of the highest court in one of the country\u2019s most important presidential swing states.",
      "The April 1 election will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. Looming are major cases dealing with abortion, union rights, election law and congressional redistricting \u2014 some that could influence the race for president in 2028.",
      "Musk\u2019s America PAC is the biggest outside spender in the supreme court race so far, doling out more than $3.2 million to benefit Crawford\u2019s Republican opponent, former Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel, according to state records. Building America\u2019s Future has invested some $2 million in the race, records show.",
      "The world's richest man and top adviser to President Donald Trump also has sought to broaden his political influence. Federal Election Commission filings show Musk spent nearly $300 million supporting Republican campaigns last year. And in December, he threatened to fund congressional primary opponents for Republican federal lawmakers who stand in the administration\u2019s way.",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Building America\u2019s Future has used this deceptive advertising tactic. Last September, the group registered in Virginia to use Progress 2028 as a fictitious name, Open Secrets revealed at the time. Progress 2028\u2019s website was created three days later.",
      "The following month, the group began running fake ads made to look as though they came from Democrats. They falsely claimed Harris supported policies such as eliminating gas-powered vehicles and giving voting rights to immigrants living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Building America\u2019s Future also was the sole funder of a super PAC that last year ran contradictory ads in Michigan and Pennsylvania about Harris\u2019 stance on Israel. The ads characterized her position differently in targeted messages to Arab American and Jewish voters.",
      "Earlier this month, the group took down a social media ad in Wisconsin that featured the wrong Susan Crawford. The photo was of a Harvard professor rather than the state supreme court candidate.",
      "The Facebook and Instagram ads, first reported by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, are targeted to specific users through the group\u2019s own custom lists, according to audience data in Meta\u2019s ad library.",
      "They describe Crawford as a \u201cprogressive champion\u201d and seemed to fool even some conservatives into thinking they were intended to promote her candidacy. Scott Manley, chief lobbyist for the state's chamber of commerce, which has endorsed Schimel, wrote on the social platform X, \u201cDid George Soros fund this ad?\" It was a reference to the billionaire philanthropist and liberal donor.",
      "Unlike Schimel, Crawford has never held elected office or run for office as a Democrat. Still, she has a long history of fighting for Democratic issues.",
      "That includes challenging the state's voter ID law passed by Republicans and representing Planned Parenthood in a case challenging a GOP law that required doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. She also represented teachers in a case attempting to overturn the law championed by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker that effectively ended collective bargaining rights for public workers.",
      "The ads hit at a particularly important time, with early voting starting in less than two weeks and Crawford still trying to introduce herself to voters. A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday found that about 6 in 10 Wisconsin voters don\u2019t have an opinion about her.",
      "Crawford campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman said he wasn't surprised that a Musk-backed group was \u201crunning fake and deceptive ads and lying to voters.\u201d He said Musk \u201ccharged into this race not knowing anything about it\u201d and poured millions into it \u201cbecause he knows Brad Schimel can be bought.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Building America\u2019s Future declined to comment.",
      "While no one has matched Musk's money, plenty of high-dollar donors also have supported Crawford in the race. She's benefiting from hefty donations from Soros; Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat; Gloria Page, the mother of Google co-founder Larry Page; and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. The liberal group A Better Wisconsin Together has spent some $2.3 million to benefit her campaign.",
      "While the new ads seem clever in their deception, they probably won't be effective in swaying many voters, said Barry Burden, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He noted the messaging is mild compared to attack ads that are hitting Crawford more harshly.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018Progress 2028\u2019 ad has subtler messaging that requires the viewer to pay close attention to the content and connect the dots,\u201d Burden said. \u201cVoters who are aware enough to make these connections are probably already paying attention to the race and have enough independent information to offset any effect of the ads.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday in a fight over plans to store nuclear waste at sites in rural Texas and New Mexico.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration and a private company with a license for the Texas facility appealed a ruling by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission exceeded its authority in granting the license. The outcome of the case will affect plans for a similar facility in New Mexico roughly 40 miles (65 kilometers) away.",
      "On this issue, President Donald Trump's administration is sticking with the views of its predecessor, even with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican ally of Trump, on the other side.",
      "The push for temporary storage sites is part of the complicated politics of the nation\u2019s so far futile quest for a permanent underground storage facility.",
      "Here's what to know about the case:",
      "Roughly 100,000 tons (90,000 metric tons) of spent fuel, some of it dating from the 1980s, is piling up at current and former nuclear plant sites nationwide and growing by more than 2,000 tons (1,800 metric tons) a year. The waste was meant to be kept there temporarily before being deposited deep underground.",
      "A plan to build a national storage facility northwest of Las Vegas at Yucca Mountain has been mothballed because of staunch opposition from most Nevada residents and officials.",
      "The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has said that the temporary storage sites are needed because existing nuclear plants are running out of room. The presence of the spent fuel also complicates plans to decommission some plants, the Justice Department said in court papers.",
      "The NRC granted the Texas license to Interim Storage Partners LLC for a facility that could take up to 5,000 metric tons of spent nuclear fuel rods from power plants and 231 million tons of other radioactive waste. The facility would be built next to an existing dump site in Andrews County for low-level waste such as protective clothing and other material that has been exposed to radioactivity. The Andrews County site is about 350 miles (560 kilometers) west of Dallas, near the Texas-New Mexico state line.",
      "The New Mexico facility would be in Lea County, in the southeastern part of the state near Carlsbad. The NRC gave a license for the site to Holtec International.",
      "The licenses would allow for 40 years of storage, although opponents contend the facilities would be open indefinitely because of the impasse over permanent storage.",
      "Republicans and Democrats, environmental groups and the oil and gas industry all oppose the temporary sites.",
      "Abbott is leading Texas' opposition to the storage facility. New Mexico Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also is opposed to the facility planned for her state.",
      "A brief led by Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on behalf of several lawmakers calls the nuclear waste contemplated for the two facilities an \u201centicing target for terrorists\u201d and argues it's too risky to build the facility atop the Permian Basin, the giant oil and natural gas region that straddles Texas and New Mexico.",
      "Elected leaders of communities on the routes the spent fuel likely would take to New Mexico and Texas also are opposed.",
      "The justices will consider whether, as the NRC argues, the states forfeited their right to object to the licensing decisions because they declined to join in the commission\u2019s proceedings.",
      "Two other federal appeals courts, in Denver and Washington, that weighed the same issue ruled for the agency. Only the 5th Circuit allowed the cases to proceed.",
      "The second issue is whether federal law allows the commission to license temporary storage sites. Opponents are relying on a 2022 Supreme Court decision that held that Congress must act with specificity when it wants to give an agency the authority to regulate on an issue of major national significance. In ruling for Texas, the 5th Circuit agreed that what to do with the nation\u2019s nuclear waste is the sort of \u201cmajor question\u201d that Congress must speak to directly.",
      "But the Justice Department has argued that the commission has long-standing authority to deal with nuclear waste reaching back to the 1954 Atomic Energy Act.",

      "Firing squads have a long and storied history in the U.S. They've served as a punishment for mutiny in colonial times, a way to discourage desertion during the Civil War and a dose of frontier justice in the Old West",
      "It was a punishment for mutiny in colonial times, a way to discourage desertion during the Civil War and a dose of frontier justice in the Old West. In modern times, some consider it a more humane alternative to lethal injection. The firing squad has a long and thorny history in the U.S.",
      "South Carolina on Friday is scheduled to put the first person to death by firing squad in the U.S. in 15 years. Brad Sigmon, who was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend's parents in 2001, chose it over the two other methods in South Carolina \u2014 the electric chair and lethal injection.",
      "Since 1608, at least 144 civilian prisoners have been executed by shooting in America, nearly all in Utah. Only three have occurred since 1977, when the use of capital punishment resumed after a 10-year pause. The first of those, Gary Gilmore, caused a media sensation in part because he waived his appeals and volunteered to be executed. When asked for his last words, Gilmore replied, \u201cLet's do it.\u201d",
      "Five states \u2014 Idaho, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Utah \u2014 authorize the use of firing squads in certain circumstances.",
      "Here's a look at the history behind the death penalty method.",
      "The earliest recorded execution by shooting came in Jamestown, Virginia, in 1608. Capt. George Kendall came to be suspected of mutiny \u2014 and possibly of conspiring with Spain. Centuries later, in 1996, archaeologists discovered a bullet-ridden body buried in the fort's walls that many suspect was Kendall.",
      "In the American Revolution, public executions by firing squad were sometimes used to punish desertion.",
      "In 1776, then-Gen. George Washington spared a Connecticut soldier, Ebenezer Leffingwell, who was sentenced to die after fighting with a superior, the Journal of the American Revolution recounted. Leffingwell had been bound, blindfolded and forced to kneel in front of a crowd when a chaplain involved in the proceedings announced he would live.",
      "Mark Smith, a history professor at the University of South Carolina, said firing squads were used \u2014 not often \u2014 by both sides during the Civil War to create a \u201cpublic spectacle, a vision of terror\u201d to keep soldiers in line.",
      "\u201cA man could be sitting on his own coffin at times or blindfolded, shot by six or seven men, one of whom has a blank,\u201d the professor said. \u201cThese were gatherings designed to shock and it worked.\u201d",
      "At least 185 men were executed by firing squad during the Civil War, according to Christopher Q. Cutler in a Cleveland State Law Review article.",
      "Firing squads were primarily used only in Utah, where the lawmakers in 1851 designated three possible punishments for murder: shooting, hanging or beheading. The first firing squad execution was carried out in a courthouse enclosure, disappointing a crowd waiting outside to see it.",
      "Only one other state since 1900 has executed someone by shooting: Nevada, which in 1913 built a contraption that fired three guns by pulling strings because it had trouble finding volunteers to serve on a firing squad.",
      "An 1877 sentencing in Utah gave rise to the first U.S. Supreme Court case challenging a specific execution method. Wallace Wilkerson, who shot a man to death during a heated game of cribbage, challenged authorities' plans to kill him by firing squad. The court declined his appeal, finding that unlike some other bygone methods \u2014 drawing and quartering, for example \u2014 execution by firing squad would not bring the sort of \u201cterror, pain and disgrace\u201d that would violate the 8th Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "As it turned out, Wilkerson's killing was botched, Cutler noted: Reportedly intoxicated and smoking a cigar, he moved slightly just before the executioners shot. Badly wounded, he fell to the ground, saying, \"My God! They\u2019ve missed it.\u201d It took him an agonizing 15 minutes to die.",
      "Among other famous firing squad executions in Utah was the 1915 death of labor activist and songwriter Joe Hill, who until the end insisted on his innocence in the murder of a grocer and his son.",
      "One of the reasons firing squads did not gain much use beyond Utah was that people viewed them as barbaric, according to Deborah Denno, a criminologist at Fordham School of Law.",
      "The bloody reality of those killings, as well as botched hangings and electrocutions, which sometimes led people to struggle and suffer, prompted states in the early 1980s to begin turning to lethal injection, a procedure viewed \u2014 at least initially \u2014 as more humane.",
      "But since then, lethal injection has become the most commonly botched execution method, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. States have struggled to obtain the required drugs, and some have taken another look at firing squads \u2014 an old but largely reliable method. Lawmakers in Idaho are considering a bill that would make firing squads the primary method of execution there.",
      "Two people now on Utah\u2019s death row have requested firing squads.",
      "Denno urged policymakers to reconsider firing squads in a 2016 law review article. Among those who have expressed similar views is Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote in a 2017 dissent that \u201cin addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.\u201d",
      "\u201cLethal injection has only gotten worse over the decades,\u201d Denno told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cThe firing squad really stands out as a relatively decent method of execution.\u201d",
      "In the annals of executions in the U.S., she said, there have been just two botched firing squad executions: Wilkerson's and that of Eliseo Mares in Utah in 1951. It's not clear what happened in Mares' case, but reports surfaced decades later that the executioners disliked him and intentionally missed his heart to prolong his suffering.",
      "With greater oversight and expert shooters, those problems wouldn't be repeated today, Denno said.",
      "In South Carolina, Sigmon, 67, chose to die by firing squad because the alternatives seemed worse, his attorney Gerald \u201cBo\u201d King wrote in a statement.",
      "Some aspects of his execution are modern \u2014 for example, bullets are deadlier and guns are now more precise.",
      "But much of it would have been familiar in Utah more than a century ago: A hooded inmate with a target over his heart is bound to a chair in a death chamber and may say his final words. Nearby, volunteer officers await the order to fire.",

      "There\u2019s no strict definition for sanctuary policies or sanctuary cities, but the terms generally describe limited cooperation with ICE. The agency enforces U.S. immigration laws nationwide but often seeks state and local help to hold people who've been arrested or convicted of a crime until federal officers can take custody.",

      "Trump administration officials have also argued that if communities work with them on immigration enforcement, \u201ccollateral arrests\" \u2014 when ICE detains people other than those targeted \u2014 are less likely.",
      "\u201cSanctuary cities want to keep locking us out of jails,\" President Donald Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, told reporters. \u201cThey force us into the neighborhood to find the bad guys. When we find the bad guy, many times they\u2019re with others.\u201d",
      "But some cities and states say cooperating with ICE means victims and witnesses who are in the U.S. illegally won\u2019t come forward. And, to varying degrees, officials argue that they want their localities to be welcoming places for immigrants.",
      "Advocates say that while ICE claims to target \u201cthe worst of the worst\u201d \u2014 meaning immigrants who've committed heinous crimes in the U.S. \u2014 they end up going far beyond that, destabilizing communities.",
      "Courts have repeatedly upheld the legality of most sanctuary laws.",

      "A mysterious affliction that causes prehistoric, endangered smalltooth sawfish to spin erratically in Florida waters and often die appears to have resurfaced, with more than 50 deaths last year",
      "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- A mysterious affliction that causes prehistoric, endangered smalltooth sawfish to spin erratically in Florida waters and often die appears to have resurfaced, with more than 50 deaths recorded last year, wildlife officials said Wednesday.",
      "Following a roughly nine-month lull, there have been 22 reports of the odd spinning behavior involving sawfish in waters around the Florida Keys since December, the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission reported. Six sawfish deaths were reported in this recent outbreak.",
      "It's unclear what is causing the problem that led to at least 54 sawfish deaths last year. The agency reported that testing for parasites, bacteria, viruses and more than 250 chemicals, as well as checks for such issues as toxic red tide, turned up nothing definitive.",
      "\u201cScientists did find some subtle changes in the brain tissue of affected fish, but more research is needed,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Sawfish, related to rays, skates and sharks, are named for their elongated, flat snout that contains a row of teeth on each side. Sawfish have been around for millions of years, can live for decades and grow quite large, with some as long as 17 feet (about 5 meters). They were once abundant off the coast of the southeastern U.S. but now are mainly located off the coast of southwestern Florida and the Keys island chain, as their habitats shrink.",
      "Since December 2023, more than 500 reports of spinning sawfish and other species have been documented.",
      "After the initial deaths, state legislators approved $2 million to fund the investigation into sawfish deaths in Biscayne Bay near Miami, Florida Bay and the Florida Keys. Some of the money goes to local fishing guides for water sampling and other work, according to FWC. There is also a sawfish hotline for people to report spinning or whirling fish.",
      "One theory is that a lengthy heat wave last year largely attributed to climate change and blamed for bleaching corals may have changed the algae in ocean waters, especially near the sea floor, where sawfish are often found. Like rays, sawfish gills are on their undersides, so their intake is frequently from the bottom.",
      "\u201cScientists have found a number of algal toxins in fish tissues, and these are currently being investigated as potential causes,\u201d the FWC said.",
      "The smalltooth sawfish has been on the U.S. endangered species list since 2003. Florida prohibits intentionally capturing, harming or harassing sawfish.",
      "In recent years, threatened manatees also suffered a major die-off in Florida waters as pollution killed much of their seagrass food source. State and federal officials fed tons of lettuce to manatees that gathered in winter outside a power plant for two years, and the manatee numbers have rebounded somewhat, with 565 deaths recorded in 2024 compared to a record 1,100 in 2021."

      "Jukka Siukosaari, Finland's Ambassador to the UK, agrees. \"Being part of Nato brings us on an equal footing with all the other allies. It enlarges the possibilities for Finnish companies in the defence sector and beyond.\"",
      "Private companies will benefit from pledges by Nato member states to increase defence spending.",
      "Presently, only 23 of the organisation's 32 member states currently meet a defence spending target of 2% of GDP, but ambitions have grown in recent months, only to surge in recent weeks and days amidst plenty of turbulence within the alliance.",
      "Amidst uncertainty about what Nato might look like in future, there is no doubt that these higher spending commitments will remain and perhaps even strengthen if Europe was to decide it could no longer rely on the USA.",
      "Nato's newest members' spending commitments are already ahead of those expressed by several existing members. Last year, Finland spent 2.4% and Sweden 2.2% of their respective GDP on defence, and both aim to raise this to between 2.6% and 3% in the next three years.",
      "Examples of new Nato initiatives on Europe's northern flank include the establishment of new Nato bases, and efforts to establish joint defence forces, in northern Finland.",
      "Plus the formation of The Joint Nordic Air Command, which brings together Finland's, Sweden's, Norway's and Denmark's 250 front-line combat aircraft under a joined up command structure, with flexible basing and backed by shared intelligence.",
      "In addition, substantial investments will be required to replenish stockpiles of advanced weapons systems, including missiles and anti-tank systems, Mr Johansson points out.",
      "What is Nato and how much do members spend on defence?",
      "Jeremy Bowen: Trump-Zelensky row signals looming crisis between Europe and US",
      "Katya Adler: Fractured Europe seeks credible answers on Ukraine",
      "And while the White House this week announced a pause in US military aid to Ukraine, European leaders have declared they're in it for the long haul, so here too we can expect substantial and ongoing spending on arms.",
      "Aerial surveillance programmes and underwater systems are also increasingly in demand as the returning tension between Russia and the West brings a new chill to the Arctic region.",
      "In these areas Saab's boss is eager to promote its own solutions, such as the GlobalEye airborne early warning and control platform, and its Sea Wasp, a remotely-controlled underwater vehicle that can neutralise explosive devices.",
      "Yet given Donand Trump's strong emphasis on \"America first\", it is unlikely that he will be happy with European Nato members choosing Saab, or indeed any other European defence firm over US rivals.",
      "Europe will need to balance its desire to reduce its reliance on the US with their obvious need to retain American support.",
      "European members will also need to consider Nato's defence systems' complexities and interdependencies. They often combine technologies and machines, weaponry and ammunition, vehicles, crafts and vessels, that are produced in several different Nato countries.",
      "In a sense, then, the alliance is held together by complex supply chains and contractual agreements that could not possibly be untangled overnight.",
      "\"Europe's Trans-Atlantic relationship will always remain important,\" says Mr Johansson, though he also points to a \"growing realisation in Europe that we have to do more on our own\".",
      "\"The US really protects its own defence industry, and we should do the same in Europe,\" he says, as he welcomes \"fierce competition\" between commercial defence companies.",
      "Much of this competition may be between relative newcomers to the defence industry, however.",
      "Finnish government agency Business Finland has published a guidebook that offers advice to companies on how to do business with Nato.",
      "Its authors predict that the armed forces on both sides of the Atlantic will have \"significant new needs for services and equipment, both hi-tech and low-tech\".",
      "Many of these needs will need to be met by start-ups and established small to medium-sized companies, says the guide, rather than exclusively by large, established defence companies.",
      "Johan Sj\u00f6berg, security and defence policy advisor at the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise, says Nato membership has opened doors for Swedish companies, not least because \"the perspective of other countries and companies [towards them] has changed\".",
      "Mr Sj\u00f6berg adds that he favours a \"holistic view, that security is good for business, as increased security and stability provide long-term credibility\".",
      "In Finland too, Nato membership has created new opportunities, especially for the plethora of small and medium-sized companies that Ambassador Siukosaari refer to as \"Nokia-spin-offs\".",
      "These are expected to increasingly provide cutting edge tech, such as drones, sensors and digital surveillance systems for programmes such as the Norway-to-Poland \"drone wall\" that six Nato members are developing to defend their borders with Russia.",
      "Indeed, as the nature of warfare changes, Europe's security may increasingly rely on cyber-defence and the protection of civilian installations such as systems-critical seabed pipelines and cables.",
      "But perhaps the most revolutionary idea to emerge from Nato's Nordic expansion is the region's \"Total Defence\" concept.",
      "Also applied by Norway and Denmark, it considers national infrastructure such as the internet and telephony, energy generation and distribution, road networks, and secure supplies of food, medicine as parts of a total defence system.",
      "Much of this may not be registered as defence spending in the statistics, but at the same time, none of it is free.",
      "Beyond the civilian infrastructure spending, national military service, for instance, sometimes takes people away from the economically productive parts of the economy, Ambassador Siukosaari points out.",
      "But perhaps what they deliver does more for the nation than mere provision of products and services?",
      "Nato's newest members believe they could teach other allied countries a thing or two about defence. They clearly offer new perspectives both on how defence spending should be measured. And perhaps also on how civilian society and private enterprise can play their parts.",

      "Tariffs could hit growth and pose \"substantial\" risks to the UK and world economies, Andrew Bailey told MPs.",
      "Other Bank experts also said trade frictions could hurt companies in the UK and elsewhere.",
      "Mr Bailey urged for trade disputes to be settled globally, and stressed the importance of trade.",
      "'Substantial risks'",
      "The US has been ratcheting up trade tensions, and this week imposed new tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, and doubled the levy recently put on Chinese goods.",
      "Speaking to MPs about the effects of Trump tariffs, Mr Bailey said: \"The risks to the UK economy, and indeed the world economy, are substantial.\"",
      "When asked whether Trump tariffs could mean less money in UK consumers' pockets, Mr Bailey said \"Yes. We serve the people, and we have to take it very seriously\".",
      "Megan Greene, a member of the Bank's monetary policy committee, said there is a lack of certainty about how far the US will go in implementing tariffs, and about how countries will respond.",
      "But tariffs could affect the UK economy in a number of ways, she said.",
      "If there are tariffs imposed on UK goods going into the US, this would \"put downward pressure\" on the UK economy, because firms would find it harder to sell to US consumers.",
      "But that could also lower inflation, the pace at which prices rise.",
      "If supply chains fragmented and had to be reordered this would hit UK growth and push up inflation.",
      "\"Ultimately, tariffs would push down on growth\", Greene said, adding that there was a \"tonne of uncertainty\" about how Trump's tariffs would play out, but there would probably be more negatives for UK the economic activity than positives.",
      "Professor Alan Taylor, who is also a monetary policy committee member, agreed  the risks to the economy outweigh the upsides, and that \"is true for people around the country and around the world\".",
      "He added: \"If you put sand in those wheels [of trade] we're going to be worse off on some margin.\"",
      "Mr Bailey said he agreed \"very strongly\" with the assessment of the committee members.",
      "\"Trade supports growth. Openness supports the spread of innovation and ideas,\" he said.",
      "Trump's tariffs risk economic turbulence - and voter backlash",
      "Trump mulls exemption for some carmakers from tariffs",
      "Bailey called for trade disputes to be settled via the World Trade Organization, rather than thrashed out between the US and other countries.",
      "Mr Trump and his administration have said higher tariffs on goods imported into the US will help it get better deals with allies and rivals around the world.",
      "But experts have warned that trade barriers could hurt the US, triggering higher prices and more inflation, as well as hitting economies around the world.",
      "Separately, Bailey also warned of risks should the US leave institutions like the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which lend to countries to try to avert financial crises.",
      "Some of Trump's allies, including key White House staff, have previously recommended withdrawing.",
      "Bailey said the move would be a \"very damaging thing for the world\".",
      "But he said he \"strongly\" welcomed news that the new US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, \"believes in multi-lateralism\", or collectively coordinated action."

      "The UK competition watchdog has ended its investigation into the partnership between Microsoft and the maker of ChatGPT, OpenAI.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) was looking into whether Microsoft's relationship with what is the world's best known artificial intelligence (AI) firm changed after the turmoil which saw its boss Sam Altman fired and then rehired.",
      "The CMA has concluded that, despite Microsoft investing billions of dollars into OpenAI and having exclusive uses of some of its AI products, the partnership remains the same, so is not subject to review under the UK's merger rules.",
      "Digital rights campaigners, Foxglove, said it showed the CMA had been \"defanged.\"",
      "The CMA opened the probe in December 2023, after Microsoft had put pressure on OpenAI to re-employ Mr Altman, days after he had been sacked.",
      "\"In view of Microsoft's potentially important role in securing Sam Altman's re-appointment, the CMA believed there was a reasonable chance that an investigation would reveal that Microsoft had increased its control over OpenAI's commercial policy,\" the watchdog said.",
      "But on Wednesday, it concluded Microsoft \"exerts a high level of material influence\" over OpenAI's commercial policy without fully controlling it.",
      "\"Because this change of control has not happened, the partnership in its current form does not qualify for review under the UK's merger control regime,\" CMA Executive Director for Mergers Joel Bamford posted in an article on LinkedIn.",
      "But he added: \"The CMA's findings on jurisdiction should not be read as the partnership being given a clean bill of health on potential competition concerns; but the UK merger control regime must of course operate within the remit set down by Parliament.\"",
      "'Nothing to see here'",

      "\"The CMA has sat on this decision for over a year, yet within just a few weeks of a former Amazon boss being installed as chair, it has decided everything was absolutely fine all along, nothing to see here,\" said Foxglove co-executive director Rosa Curling.",
      "\"This is a bad sign that Big Tech has successfully convinced the prime minister to defang our competition regulator and let Big Tech gobble up the current generation of cutting-edge tech \u2013 just like they did the last one,\" she told the BBC.",
      "When BBC News contacted the CMA for a response to these comments, they pointed us to Mr Bamford's LinkedIn post, where he said: \"We are not blind to the length of time that this investigation has taken... We know pace matters to business confidence and investment.\"",
      "He added the reason this investigation took so long was because the relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI had been changing over that time.",
      "In 2024, while Mr Bokkerink was chair, the CMA also issued similar \"found not to qualify\" decisions on other AI partnerships it reviewed involving firms including Microsoft, Amazon and Google.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's latest move has left investors in a spin - for good reason.",
      "With the stroke of a pen, the tariffs he has imposed on Canada, Mexico and China have turned back the clock 70 years, erasing decades of globalisation.",
      "Tariffs, he says is a beautiful word, signalling jobs and riches for America.",
      "However, history tells us that those firing the opening shots in a trade war also  suffer heavy casualties. Despite the president's rhetoric, American consumers are  on the front line.",
      "These extra taxes mean that Americans are facing the highest level of tariffs on goods being imported to their country since the 1930s.",
      "Vegetables from Mexico, wheat from Canada, toys and T-shirts from China are all in the firing line. Retailers of such items can have very narrow profit margins and will raise prices quickly to cover the tariffs.",
      "Consumers will notice the price rises.",
      "Groceries may be one of Trump's favourite words, but his own electorate may not appreciate the increase in bills they could face. Assuming no further tariffs, economists suggest US inflation, already higher than expected, could rise further in the second half of this year.",
      "A price worth paying \"to make America great again\"? Look no further than the laundry room for a cautionary tale.",
      "During his first-term of office in 2018, Trump imposed tariffs of up to 50% on imported washing machines after American producer Whirlpool complained about cheap South Korean competition.",
      "Those rivals - Samsung and LG - then set up in America, creating close to 2,000 jobs.",
      "But at what price? An imported washing machine cost an American shopper almost a third more at the start of 2023, just before tariffs were abolished, than five years previously.",
      "Add up the costs of tariffs and one study claims each of those jobs cost Americans the equivalent of more than $800,000 (\u00a3627,000).",
      "Those tariffs of course meant revenue for American governments and that source has increased dramatically in recent years, following the raft of tariffs Trump also imposed in his first term on China - most of which were retained under President Joe Biden.",
      "However, the amount netted is equivalent to a tax rise on American households of up to $300. Ultimately it is they who are footing the bill - and will continue to do so.",
      "Six things that could get more expensive for Americans under Trump tariffs",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Then consider the impact on American manufacturers who have businesses spanning Canada, Mexico and perhaps even China. Overall, economists think we could be looking at a hit to US growth of up to 1% - not enough to prompt a recession, but unwelcome nonetheless.",
      "In sheer numbers terms, the hit to the Canadian economy could be greater, economists say. It sells more than $400bn worth of goods to America every year, accounting for a fifth of its income.",
      "But it has the capacity to lower interest rates, and healthy public finances, providing policy makers with scope to cushion the blow for Canadians.",
      "The damage to Mexico's national income could be less severe, but its central bank has less capacity to cut interest rates making it harder to deflect the pain.",
      "All of this will be anxiously watched by the European Union, likely next in line for those Trump tariffs. Germany, already in a fragile state, accounts for about a third of the goods sold by the EU to the US.",
      "China, despite being the target of Trump's repeated trade blows could actually be less vulnerable. Its exports to the US account for less than 3% of national income - easily made up elsewhere.",
      "Ironically, some of this resilience is down to the tariffs imposed by President Trump last time round. China simply looked for new markets.",
      "Countries like the UK could also benefit from a furthering of such trade diversion, more access to cheaper goods -  something that could  keep our own inflation down.",
      "A key point about trade wars is that there are winners as well as losers - particularly for those countries outside President Trump's firing line. Vietnam and Malaysia for example saw their exports grow rapidly during President Trump's last term as they scrambled to replace China in selling to America.",
      "If the UK continues to escape the wrath of President Trump, we could actually benefit from closer trading links with his country and indeed from greater foreign investment, if we looked to be a more certain environment than some of our competitors. But of course, our fate remains unclear.",
      "As it stands, the prospects for global growth in 2025 have dulled, but a recession appears very unlikely. However, in Trump world we have learnt very quickly to expect the unexpected - so much still depends on what happens from here.",
      "And that uncertainty itself is harming business confidence both in the US and around the world, putting off key decisions about where to invest and create jobs.",
      "Weaponising uncertainty too comes at a price - even on home soil."

      "If they are quashed by the court, they can apply to the Overturned Convictions Scheme. If they are overturned under legislation - the Post Office (Horizon System) Offences Act 2024 which became law in May - they can go to the newer Horizon Convictions Redress Scheme.",
      "ITV's drama Alan Bates vs The Post Office has introduced millions to the long-running scandal",

      "There have been 983 convictions - 700 of which were privately initiated by the Post Office - linked to the faulty Horizon IT programme.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 00:01:51 GMT",
    "summary": "From handheld to space-based, new methane detectors are making it easier to track the greenhouse gas.",
    "story": [
      "In and around Washington DC, volunteers and activists have been walking through streets and homes to see how healthy the air is.",
      "They're armed with industry-grade monitors that detect the presence of several gases. The devices look a bit like walkie-talkies.",
      "But they are equipped with sensors that reveal the extent of methane, turning this invisible gas into concrete numbers on a screen.",
      "Those numbers can be worrying. In a 25-hour period, neighbourhood researchers found 13 outdoor methane leaks at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit. They have also found methane leaks within homes.",
      "A key concern has been health. Methane and other gases, notably nitrogen oxide from gas stoves, are linked to higher risks of asthma.",
      "Djamila Bah, a healthcare worker as well as a tenant leader for the community organisation Action in Montgomery, reports that one out of three children have asthma in the homes tested by the organisation.",
      "\"It's very heartbreaking and alarming when you're doing the testing and then you find out that some people are living in that condition that they can't change for now,\" Ms Bah says.",
      "Methane might be a hazard to human health, but it is also powerful greenhouse gas.",
      "While it has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide (CO2), methane is much better at trapping heat and it accounts for about one-quarter of the rise in global temperature since industrialisation.",
      "Methane emissions come from a diverse array of sectors. Chief among these are fossil fuels, waste and agriculture.",
      "But methane is not always easy to notice.",
      "It can be detected using handheld gas sensors like the ones used by the community researchers. It can also be visualised using infrared cameras, as methane absorbs infrared light.",
      "Monitoring can be ground-based, including vehicle-mounted devices, or aerial, including drone-based measurement. Combining technologies is especially helpful.",
      "\"There is no perfect solution,\" says Andreea Calcan, a programme management officer at the International Methane Emissions Observatory, a UN initiative.",
      "There are trade-offs between the cost of technologies and the scale of analysis, which could extend to thousands of facilities.",
      "Thankfully, she has seen an expansion of affordable methane sensors in the past decade. So there is no reason to wait on monitoring methane, at any scale. And the world needs to tackle both the small leakages and the high-emitting events, she says.",
      "At a larger scale, satellites are often good at pinpointing super-emitters: less frequent but massively emitting events, such as huge oil and gas leaks. Or they can detect the smaller and more spread-out emitters that are much more common, such as cattle farms.",
      "Current satellites are typically designed to monitor one scale of emitter, says Riley Duren, the CEO of the Carbon Mapper, a not-for-profit organisation that tracks emissions.",
      "He likens this to film cameras. A telephoto lens offers higher resolution, while a wide-angle lens allows a larger field of view.",
      "With a new satellite, Carbon Mapper is focusing on high resolution, high sensitivity and rapid detection, to more precisely detect emissions from super-emitters. In August 2024 Carbon Mapper launched the Tanager-1 satellite, together with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Earth imaging company Planet Labs.",
      "Satellites have struggled to spot methane emissions in certain environments, such as poorly maintained oil wells in snowy areas with lots of vegetation. Low light, high latitudes, mountains and offshore areas also present challenges.",
      "Mr Duren says that the high-resolution Tanager-1 can respond to some of these challenges, for instance by essentially sneaking peeks through gaps in cloud cover or forest cover.",
      "\"In an oil and gas field, high resolution could be the difference between isolating the methane emissions from an oil well head from an adjacent pipeline,\" he says. This could help determine exactly who is responsible.",
      "Carbon Mapper began releasing emissions data, drawing on Tanager-1 observations, in November.",
      "It will take several years to build out the full constellation of satellites, which will depend on funding.",
      "Tanager-1 isn't the only new satellite with a focus on delivering methane data. MethaneSAT, a project of the Environmental Defense Fund and private and public partners, also launched in 2024.",
      "With the increasing sophistication of all these satellite technologies, \"What was previously unseeable is now visible,\" Mr Duren says. \"As a society we're still learning about our true methane footprint.\"",
      "It's clear that better information is needed about methane emissions. Some energy companies have sought to evade methane detection by using \"enclosed combustors\" to obscure gas flaring.",
      "Translating knowledge into action isn't always straightforward. Methane levels continue to rise, even as the information available does as well.",
      "For instance, the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS) uses satellite data to detect methane emissions notify companies and governments. The MARS team gathered a large quantity of methane plume images, verified by humans, to train a machine learning model to recognise such plumes.",
      "In all the locations that MARS constantly monitors, based on their history of emissions, the model checks for a methane plume every day. Analysts then scrutinise any alerts.",
      "Because there are so many locations to be monitored, \"this saves us a lot of time,\" says Itziar Irakulis Loitxate, the remote sensing lead for the International Methane Emissions Observatory, which is responsible for MARS.",
      "In the two years since its launch, MARS has sent out over 1,200 alerts for major methane leaks. Only 1% of those have led to responses.",
      "However, Ms Irakulis remains optimistic. Some of those alerts led to direct action such as repairs, including cases where emissions ceased even though the oil and gas operator didn't officially provide feedback.",
      "And communications are improving all the time, Ms Irakulis says. \"I have hope that this 1%, we will see it grow a lot in the next year.\"",
      "At the community level, it's been powerful for residents, such as those in the Washington DC area, to take the air pollution readings themselves and use these to counter misinformation. \"Now that we know better, we can do better,\" says Joelle Novey of Interfaith Power and Light.",

    "summary": "Switzerland's already upmarket tourism sector is trying to attract more high rollers.",
    "story": [
      "The world is a very insecure place right now - conflict, climate change, and fears of recession dominate the headlines. But for some people, things are going rather well - the wealthy.",
      "Despite the global turmoil, the number of billionaires in the world is growing and the personal wealth of each of them is increasing too.",
      "So what to do with all that money? The growing trend for the ultimate luxury experience is a clue as to what the very rich are doing with their cash. For the tourist industry in particular, it's an opportunity.",
      "In Switzerland, which has long cultivated a reputation for understated luxury, the number of five-star hotels is increasing faster than any other category. Many of them were built in the early 20th century - grand belle epoque palaces serving a then emerging class of privileged, primarily English tourists.",
      "Today, renovated to the highest standards, those hotels leave no guest's wish unmet. There are luxury spas, gourmet restaurants, and designer suites with panoramic views of the alps. Some offer \"ski butlers\" to ferry guests to and from the slopes, carry the skis, and even help put on their boots.",
      "Key markets are the US, the Gulf states, China and South East Asia. American guests in particular, Swiss hoteliers say, expect the full five-star treatment, including 24-hour room service, so that they can order food in the middle of the night.",
      "Meanwhile, China and India are emerging markets, where the first groups to travel from those two countries are among the wealthiest. Switzerland is very keen to get in at the start of that trend.",
      "But the five-star offer comes with a hefty price tag, so where does that leave those who are not billionaires? Markus Berger of Switzerland Tourism says the strategy is not to focus solely on high-end guests, but to take a hard-headed look at the figures.",
      "Stays at Swiss five-star hotels make up around 8% of all overnights, but the guests in them contribute at least 25% of Switzerland's total revenue from tourism.",
      "\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" says Mr Berger. \"The high economic significance justifies a commitment to luxury guests.\"",
      "What's more, he adds, Switzerland, with its high-wage, high-price economy, cannot compete with less expensive neighbours, particularly now that the Swiss franc is so strong.",
      "\"Switzerland has never tried to compete over prices,\" Mr Berger explains. \"There is always somewhere cheaper.\"",
      "Instead, the focus is on quality, service, and added value, like those ski butlers. In exchange, guests who come to five-star hotels also contribute a good deal to the rest of the economy, spending lavishly in the Michelin-starred restaurants and boutique shops that are also becoming a feature in a number of Swiss alpine resorts.",
      "But it's not an entirely win-win situation. In some of Switzerland's most famous up-market resorts, like St Moritz or Zermatt, there are long-standing concerns that the focus on luxury is pricing locals out of the market.",
      "A common challenge is finding accommodation for the hundreds of hotel and restaurant staff needed to provide the five-star service.",
      "They sometimes find themselves commuting, late at night when the cocktail bars and restaurants have finally closed, long journeys to other villages where the accommodation is affordable on a waiter's salary.",
      "Monika Bandi, who leads the Tourism Research Unit at Bern University's Centre for Regional Development, sees Switzerland's pitch to high-end guests as a fine balancing act. It's about \"quantity versus quality\", she says.",
      "More tourists aren't necessarily better, she believes. Instead, higher spending by existing numbers can be positive.",
      "And, she adds, Switzerland needs to watch out for the \"tipping point, where the destinations really lose their character\".",
      "Questions about a tipping point are currently being asked in the resort of Wengen, world famous for its Lauberhorn ski race, and its decades long connection with British skiers \u2013 the much-loved \"Down Hill Only\" ski club celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.",
      "And also this year, Wengen is opening its first ever five-star hotel, and there are plans too for a five-star complex of serviced \"hotel apartments\". They will be sold to wealthy tourists who want a luxury holiday home in the Alps, and they can also be rented out when the owners are absent.",
      "By calling the project a hotel, it exploits a loophole in Switzerland's strict laws against the \"cold beds\" of holiday homes. In theory, the law limits them to no more than 20% of a resort's accommodation.",
      "The Swiss Heritage Society has formally objected to the Wengen plans, because, claims spokesman Simon Weiss, the project is not really a hotel. \"It looks like a typical holiday home complex\u2026 there is no integration into the community.\"",
      "The required public spaces that a hotel would have \u2013 a restaurant and a spa \u2013 are planned, but they will all be underground. The design priority, Mr Weiss fears, is for private luxury apartments that may be occupied for only a few weeks a year. \"The design is unacceptable,\" he adds.",
      "Some Wengen locals also have their doubts. \"It's not St Moritz here,\" one told Swiss media, adding \"Wengen is not posh\".",
      "Wengen's tourism director Rolf Wegm\u00fcller agrees with that assessment, but says the trend towards luxury accommodation won't change the resort's character. \"We're not going to have guests walking around in fur coats all of a sudden,\" he says.",
      "Wengen, he points out, is only accessible by train, so, unlike St Moritz, there will be no Bentleys or Rolls-Royces taking up parking spaces. Even if they could ostentatiously display their wealth, Mr Wegm\u00fcller believes \"our guests won't want to show off what they have\".",
      "The resort also has visitors who come back year after year, contributing to the integration Mr Weiss worries about losing. \"Some families have been coming for generations,' says Mr Wegm\u00fcller. 'The locals know them, and that's good.\"",
      "Among them are Brian Bollen, keen member of the Down Hill Only Club, who has been coming to Wengen for more than 50 years. He loves it, but does worry that some of \"the charm has gone from the place\u2026 it's over built\".",
      "But most in Wengen, like Switzerland Tourism, see the investment in the alpine resorts as positive. These villages were, not much more than a century ago, very poor. A 19th English guide to the Swiss alps wrote that \"most of the children are beggars\".",
      "In more recent years, the global trade rules limiting agricultural subsidies have forced many small alpine dairy farms to close. Tourism, winter and summer, is enormously important for the Swiss economy, especially for the mountain communities.",
      "And, as Mr Berger of Switzerland Tourism points out, while the five-star sector is growing, three-star hotels are still the biggest category. \"We have one to five-star [in Wengen],\" adds Mr Wegm\u00fcller. \"That's a good thing in a resort.\"",
      "And while the people with unlimited money to spend on luxury travel may still be in a tiny minority, their numbers, and their wealth, are growing. Switzerland's approach \u2013 not cheaper, but better, not more people, just richer \u2013 seems to be paying off.",

      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",
      "When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to \"be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,\" he says.",

    "story": [
      "Academics from leading universities have condemned the decision to pull a scheme teaching Latin in the state sector.",
      "The \u00a34m, four-year project was introduced by the Conservative government in 2022, but that was ditched by Labour in February with immediate effect.",
      "Critics of the programme said its success was limited, but some academics and MPs have described it as a \"tragedy\" for young people from less privileged backgrounds.",
      "The government said it inherited a deficit which meant \"tough decisions were needed\", but Latin GCSE pupils sitting exams in summer would get support.",
      "There are some state schools that still offer pupils the chance to learn a language some describe as dead.",
      "At Keswick School in Cumbria, the subject is studied after hours as an extra option.",
      "For the last ten years it has been taught to GCSE level by Marcella Jackson who said it is not just for the academic elite.",
      "\"We offer Latin to pupil premium students, to children from different sets, abilities and backgrounds,\" Ms Jackson said.",
      "\"They all like languages, they like history and it's nice to give them an opportunity they wouldn't get anywhere else.\"",
      "Some of her former GCSE students say they have benefited from their insight into the ancient language.",
      "Marianne, who is now in the sixth form, said: \"I want to become a vet and in medicine it's a kind of universal language for all sorts of things, so it's really useful.\"",
      "Classmate Richard said: \"I really enjoyed learning where the words have come that we use in modern English, and so many European languages are all derived from Latin.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School is another that offers the language to GCSE level, but as part of the main school day.",
      "When I visited they had a Latin VIP in their lesson.",
      "Prof Arlene Holmes-Henderson leads a department at Durham University dedicated to promoting the study of Latin and the Classics.",
      "She had a stark statistic to pass on to the Latin learners: \"In the state sector, you have four times more chance of being able to study a classical subject in London and the South East than you do in the North East.\"",
      "She said that means many pupils studying in the shadow of Hadrian's Wall are missing out on the benefits of Latin.",
      "'Unlock literacy'",
      "During a seven-year research project, Prof Holmes-Henderson discovered Latin study made the most difference to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.",
      "She found there were \"three groups of pupils who benefited most - young people with special educational needs and disabilities, students who speak English as an additional language and those who qualify for free school meals\".",
      "\"All three groups, who face barriers to their learning, unlocked significant benefits in English literacy.\"",
      "Durham Johnston School's Latin teacher Cathy Bothwell said helping the disadvantaged is the reason the school has persevered with the subject.",
      "She said: \"Despite the cost of offering the subject, it is that social justice aspect.",
      "\"We have a very varied demographic and providing everyone with access to demanding academic subjects like Latin is a key part of that.\"",
      "There is another divide too.",
      "A British Society study in 2020 found that while only 3% of state schools offered Latin, that figure rose to 49% in the fee-paying sector.",
      "Only two of the region's schools - Polam Hall in Darlington, and Queen Elizabeth Grammar in Hexham - had taken advantage of the 2022 government Latin programme, but one of a group of MPs working to promote the study of the classics is determined the current government does not give up on Latin in state schools.",
      "York Central's Rachael Maskell, who is a Labour member of the All Party Parliamentary Classics Group, said it would be a tragedy if the subject does end up purely in the private sector.",
      "She said: \"Giving young people from less privileged backgrounds access is really important.",
      "\"We cannot have the whole classics agenda being in the hands of the few, so let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater and [instead] ensure there is something there for the benefit of classical education across the UK.\"",
      "'Latin is for everyone'",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"The \u00a322bn black hole we inherited means tough decisions are needed across the public sector.\"",
      "The department said it had \"worked with Classics for All and the Classical Association so teachers at the 39 schools on the Latin Excellence Programme can continue to benefit from high quality teacher training, and so that the small number of pupils in those schools who are due to sit their Latin GCSE this summer get the support they need\"\"",
      "Prof Holme-Henderson's message was \"nil desperandum\" - do not despair.",
      "She said there were alternative sources of funding for a subject that is still part of the national curriculum and the region can still be at the heart of Latin's revival.",
      "\"Durham University has the only research centre in the world dedicated to classics education research, engaging multiple stakeholders on how we can widen access to the teaching of the subject in our schools and communities.",

      "Nudity, swearing, petulance, club anthems, more nudity and a woman dressed as a horse - the 2025 Brit Awards had it all.",
      "Charli XCX was the big winner, taking home five prizes in all - including best artist, best album and song of the year.",
      "US star - and the BBC's Sound of 2025 - Chappell Roan picked up two awards; while Ezra Collective, The Last Dinner Party, Fontaines DC and Stormzy got one apiece.",
      "But no-one's only interested in all that. Here's what really went down at the 2025 ceremony at London's O2 Arena.",
      "Most predictable winner: Charli XCX",
      "Listen, this was never going to be anything other than Charli's night.",
      "The pop star's seventh album, Brat, captured the cultural zeitgeist in a way that few artists ever manage.",
      "Released in June, the record combined abrasive dance-floor beats, soaring hooks and meme-friendly artwork; as the 32-year-old assessed her place in the music industry, the real and imaginary rivals she's accumulated along the way, and whether or not to leave it all behind to have a baby.",
      "In the star's own words, the album was \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "Just as everyone was absorbing that, she hired a bunch of guest stars - Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, Lorde, Addison Rae, Bon Iver - and re-recorded an entirely new, sometimes superior, version of the album.",
      "Critics called it \"pop music for the future\" and praised the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's coming of age.",
      "Knowingly trashy, yet surprisingly deep, it was easily the best British album of the last 12 months - and one that proved Charli's detractors wrong.",
      "\"I feel like dance music, electronic music, gets a really bad rep because everyone is like, 'It's not that deep, is it? And I kind of feel it is,\" she said after collecting her second award.",
      "\"This genre of music, for me, is euphoric, it allows me to escape, it allows me to feel on such a deep level.\"",
      "Best visual pun: This coat",
      "Teddy Swims, swimming in teddy bears. We see what he did there.",
      "Least practical dress: Jade Thirlwall",
      "Jade Thirlwall was the last of the Little Mix crew to launch a solo career, but she's been giving it her all.",
      "As well as winning best pop artist at Saturday's ceremony, she put on one of the night's highest-concept performances - a five-act melodrama about the cruelty of the music industry and her creative rebirth.",
      "Over the course of the night, she wore six different outfits. But she chose the wrong one for climbing the stairs to pick up her trophy. Thank goodness the Sugababes were there to help.",
      "Sneakiest host: Jack Whitehall",
      "Jack Whitehall made a welcome return as the ceremony's host, after four years away.",
      "As ever, his jokes were close to the bone... including a passing reference to allegations surrounding some presenters on Brits broadcaster ITV.",
      "\"ITV had so many of its presenters cancelled this year that they had to come crawling back to an ex, and what an honour it is to be hosting again the biggest night in British music,\" he joked.",
      "Later, he described Youtuber-turned-musician KSI as \"an inspiration\".",
      "\"Because you listen to Kendrick Lamar and you're like, 'I couldn't do that in a million years'. Then I listen to your song and I'm like, 'Oh, I could do this'.\"",
      "Speaking before the show, Whitehall revealed a sneaky secret: He uses a fake script during rehearsals.",
      "\"Previously I used to do the actual script in rehearsal, and then you'd have an hour of people from record labels and publishers coming and knocking on the dressing room door going, 'You can't say this, you can't say that',\" he told Heart radio.",
      "\"So now I just do this fake script, which if you heard it, you'd be like, 'This is the lamest script ever', because it's all me just complimenting everyone and going, 'Oh, our next award is the best musician I've ever heard. They're great.'\"",

      "But lots of the winners on Saturday used their speeches to criticise the way they are being treated.",

      "Asked about the moment he realised it had taken on a life of its own, he told us: \"I got new wi-fi the other day, and they put me on hold... and it was Stargazing.",

      "Sabrina Carpenter was the night's biggest star - opening the show with a cheeky wink, a phalanx of bearskin-wearing guards and a vaudevillian mash-up of Espresso, Bed Chem and... er, Rule, Britannia.",
      "But was the decision to hand her the \"global success\" award a thinly-veiled ploy to tempt her back on to the stage?",
      "The prize was originally created in 2013 to recognise British acts who had sold millions of records and concert tickets abroad. The previous recipients were One Direction (2013-14), Sam Smith (2015), Adele (2016-17) and Ed Sheeran (2018-19).",
      "Six years ago it was abandoned altogether... until they needed something to honour Sabrina.",

      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",

      "They were tested on bacteria growing in the laboratory and on mice with pneumonia and sepsis. The researchers said they were getting results comparable to some established antibiotics.",
      "And when the researchers took cells in the laboratory and disabled the proteasome they were far easier to infect with bacteria like Salmonella.",
      "Prof Daniel Davis, the head of life sciences and an immunologist at Imperial College London, said the findings were \"extremely provocative and very interesting\" as they changed our understanding of how our body fights infection.",
      "\"What's really exciting about this, is it's a totally undiscovered process by which anti-germ molecules are made inside our cells, it feels profoundly important and surprising.\"",
      "But he cautioned that turning this into a new source of antibiotics is an idea that \"still needs to be tested\" and that will take time.",

    "story": [
      "A common vaginal condition known as bacterial vaginosis (BV) may actually be a sexually transmitted infection (STI), according to researchers.",
      "The NHS currently says BV is caused by \"a change in the natural balance of bacteria in your vagina and is not an STI\", even though it can be triggered by sex.",
      "However, a study claims BV - which affects nearly a third of women worldwide and can lead to infertility, premature births and newborn deaths - is spread during intercourse and fits the definition of an STI.",
      "The Australian trial, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, found treating sexual partners, not just the patient, can be vital to clear the infection.",
      "What is BV?",
      "BV is a common cause of unusual vaginal discharge that has a strong fishy smell.",
      "The colour and consistency may change too, such as becoming greyish-white as well as thin and watery.",
      "Half of women with bacterial vaginosis do not have any symptoms though.",
      "Bacterial vaginosis does not usually cause any soreness or itching.",
      "It can be treated with antibiotic tablets or gels or creams.",
      "In the trial of 164 couples with BV, the researchers achieved higher cure rates by treating BV as an STI, with both sexual partners - rather than just the woman - given antibiotics.",
      "The doctors stopped the study early when it became clear that BV recurrence was halved using this approach.",
      "One of the lead researchers, Prof Catriona Bradshaw, said: \"Our trial has shown that reinfection from partners is causing a lot of the BV recurrence women experience, and provides evidence that BV is in fact an STI.",
      "\"Part of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still don't know precisely which bacteria are the cause, but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,\" she added.",
      "In the study, run by Monash University and Alfred Health researchers at the Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, half of the men got an oral antibiotic and a topical antibiotic cream to apply to the skin for one week, while the control group of men were given no treatment.",
      "Given the findings, the clinic has now changed its clinical practice to routinely treat both partners.",
      "The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said the findings provided \"valuable evidence supporting what has long been suspected \u2013 that BV-associated bacteria may be sexually transmitted, particularly in those who experience recurrent infections\".",
      "\"This research enhances our understanding of BV and offers promising insights that may help to guide treatment approaches in more persistent cases,\" said a spokesperson.",
      "If you have symptoms of an STI or concerns about BV, visit your doctor or local sexual health clinic."

    "story": [
      "The UK was once ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care - but that's not the case any longer. And according to experts, the problem runs far deeper than money",
      "The people closest to Terry Leader remember him as a man who was always laughing. He emigrated to the UK from the Caribbean island of St Kitts as a child, and was sporty, representing the junior Great Britain martial arts team in the 1970s.",
      "Later he became a father of three and worked as a metal spinner and enjoyed spending time with friends and family. Then in 2021, shortly after he retired, everything changed. Terry discovered he had terminal stomach cancer.",
      "His final wish was to die at home, surrounded by family. But despite being referred for specialist end-of-life care support, Terry and Gillian, his partner of 27 years, were left to navigate his final months largely alone.",
      "Apart from medication from Terry's GP and a couple of visits from district nurses, \"there was nothing\", says Gillian.",
      "\"I couldn't understand why \u2013 we kept asking but it was hard to get to the bottom of it. I really didn't know what to do and was doing my best to care for him.\"",
      "\"He was in agony at times \u2013 crying out in pain and crawling around. It was so difficult to watch and feel helpless.\"",
      "As the months passed, Terry deteriorated and was eventually taken to hospital. \"I slept on a Z-bed bed next to him, trying my best to look after him,\" says Gillian.",
      "He died just over two weeks later. He was 67.",
      "\"It was not how he wanted to spend his last days,\" she tells me today. \"I want to see changes so others do not have to go through what we did.\"",
      "The 'inadequate' state of care",
      "Terry and Gillian's story is far from unique \u2013 and this has become a factor as MPs debate a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek to end their own lives.",
      "Some opponents of changing the law have highlighted what they describe as the inadequate state of palliative care - the services that provide support at the end of life to manage pain and other symptoms.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting, who is against the bill, has warned that people nearing the end of their lives may feel \"coerced\" by a lack of better alternatives.",
      "Like Terry, the overwhelming majority of people say they would like to die at home,  Office for National Statistics figures suggest, but in reality just over a quarter do. Instead, the most common place of death is in hospital.",
      "It is estimated that at least three-quarters of the 650,000 people who die every year in the UK require palliative care. But a recent report by end-of-life charity Marie Curie suggested more than a fifth of those who need it in England and Wales do not receive any.",
      "And overall, half of families said they were unhappy about the care their loved ones receive in their final months.",
      "But this hasn't always been the case - until recently the picture was very different.",
      "'It's not just about money'",
      "As recently as 2015, the UK was ranked the best country in the world for end-of-life care by the Economist Intelligence Unit. However, Association for Palliative Medicine president Dr Sarah Cox says: \"That's not the case any longer. We're not getting the funding we need. But it is not just about money \u2013 it is the way services are organised.\"",
      "There are many reasons people end up dying in hospital when they would have preferred to have done so at home. Palliative care staff I have spoken say when people are in their final weeks some decide they need to go to hospital as they become frightened or do not want to be a burden on their loved ones, while in other cases families believe that being in hospital will help prolong their relative's life.",
      "But, ultimately, the lack of palliative care is thought to be the crucial factor in most cases, experts say. And so accident and emergency departments in hospitals become the safety net.",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it''Focus on palliative care not assisted dying''We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "'Palliative care is not good enough - there's no plan to fix it'",
      "'Focus on palliative care not assisted dying'",
      "'We felt on our own looking after mum in her last days'",
      "The Marie Curie report found around half of people in England and Wales end up going to A&E at least once in their final three months, and one in eight spend 30 days or more in hospital. And a hospital death is not always in the relative comfort of a bed on a ward.",
      "Hospital palliative care doctor Dr Rachel Clarke says she can spend whole days in A&E trying her best to care for patients dying in resuscitation areas and in corridors. \"It's a travesty people end their lives like that.\"",
      "Specialist palliative care is actually provided by a range of different organisations. \"People receive it from hospitals, from community NHS teams, from social care and from hospices,\" says Dr Cox.",
      "\"But families tell us that there is a lack of coordination between the different parts of the system. People struggle to get the help they need and end up in hospital.\"",
      "This is exactly what happened to Terry, who was rushed to hospital in an ambulance because of a fluid build-up related to his cancer two weeks before he died and never returned home. With better support at home, it is quite possible he would never have needed to be admitted.",
      "On top of the financial pressures felt by the rest of the NHS, experts say that a combination of demographic changes, different parts of the system acting in isolation and cash being spent in the wrong places have all brought the palliative care system to this point.",
      "And the problems are becoming more acute each year. For the 30 years up to 2011, the number of people dying in the UK was falling but that has changed as the people born during the boom in births following World War Two have grown old. Over the next decade, the number of deaths a year is expected to increase by 12%.",
      "The difficulties faced by hospices",
      "Where it works well, palliative care makes all the difference to those who use it. Hospices are a major provider of care, supporting 300,000 people a year - mainly in the community, not just inside their own buildings, contrary to popular belief.",
      "St Christopher's Hospice in south London is helping more than 1,700 people with terminal illnesses across five London boroughs. It receives referrals from GPs, district nursing teams and hospitals.",
      "Palliative care nurse Grace Larder says she provides many types of support to her patients, who have a range of conditions from motor neurone disease and Parkinson's to liver failure. This includes pain control and care for other physical problems, along with helping them with psychological and financial needs.",
      "\"We really develop relationships with people,\" she says. \"There's one patient I've been working with for nearly two years. You want to do your best.\"",
      "Most people she cares for tell her that they want to die at home, she says \u2013 but that's only possible if they get the right care.",
      "But many hospice services are in financial difficulties. Only around a third of St Christopher's funding comes from the NHS; the rest comes from fundraising and charitable donations.",
      "Any drugs the hospice provides has to come from their own funds too so they try to anticipate what their patients will need in advance and work with the patient's GP to have them prescribed on the NHS.",
      "A parliamentary report warned the current approach to funding is not sustainable.",
      "\"What other health service has to get by like that?\" says Helen King, who manages the team of nurses at St Christopher's. She points out that they are fortunate to have an affluent local community that donates generously.",
      "\"[But] the fact remains we get more money from our shops - from selling second-hand clothing - than we do from the government.\"",
      "Training is 'virtually non-existent'",
      "The government has recognised there is a problem and provided an extra \u00a3100m of funding this year to the sector \u2013 although hospice services have said this will mostly go on the rising costs they are facing.",
      "As for hospitals offering palliative care, audits show that four in 10 hospitals, for example, do not have specialist services available seven days a week - despite this having been set as a national standard in 2004.",
      "In practice, that means there is no specialist palliative care support from doctors or nurses available during evenings and weekends either in person or on-call, says Dr Clarke. \"You would never have that for other specialities like cardiology or renal so why should it happen for palliative care?\"",

      "This is compounded by the fact that palliative care training is \"virtually non-existent\" for the other staff who pick up the burden, who often lack the confidence to speak to patients and families about dying and prescribe the right drugs, she says.",
      "\"We will come into work and find patients really suffering \u2013 in pain, breathless, agitated or with nausea and vomiting. It is hard to over-state how lamentably badly-resourced palliative care services are.\"",
      "Meanwhile, in the community, GPs are left to pick up the pieces. But Dr Catherine Millington-Sanders from the Royal College of General Practicioners says that, given an \"unrelenting workload\" and staffing shortages, it is difficult to provide the care patients need, particularly home visits.",
      "\"Families and unpaid carers bear the brunt,\" she says.",
      "Money would help - but it won't fix it",
      "So what is the solution? More money would help, but it wouldn't fix everything.",
      "Earlier this year the Health Economics Unit and Nuffield Trust think-tank found that plenty was being spent on people in the final year of their life. Nearly \u00a312bn was going on their healthcare, the report found \u2013 that works out at in excess of \u00a318,000 per person for everyone who dies.",
      "But the overwhelming majority of that \u00a312bn \u2013 85% - goes on hospitals and emergency care, rather than support in the community.",
      "It is, essentially, a false economy, as support in hospital tends to be more expensive.",
      "Dr Sam Royston, executive director of research at the charity, says these findings go a long way to explaining why \"too many people are dying in places where they don't want or need to be\".",
      "He adds: \"There must be a clear long-term ambition for all UK governments to shift health expenditure on people at the end of life from hospital to community.\"",
      "According to Dr Royston, just shifting 20% of the money spent caring for dying people in hospital would be transformative for community services as it would double current spending.",
      "Is better coordination the solution?",
      "What would a better system look like? First of all, more could be done to identify people's needs before they are admitted to hospital, Dr Royston believes.",
      "He points to a service in Bradford called React which works in emergency departments to identify and assess patients and diverting them towards teams in the community who can support them instead.",
      "A study found it reduced average unplanned bed days in patients' final year of life from 38 to 18.",
      "But to reduce the number of people going to hospital in the first place, there needs to be greater co-ordination of services too, given the complexity of support and variety of providers, says Dr Cox.",
      "She says there need to be electronic records that detail the wishes of people who are at the end of life that health and care staff can access: \"These electronic systems are available in some areas but not others,\" she says.",
      "She also argues providing a central hub or phone line to help people navigate and coordinate care would be transformational.",
      "She points to a system that has been set up in Cambridgeshire between a local hospice service, NHS 111 and the local ambulance service. It provides people at the end of their life with access to a specialist nurse 24 hours a day, simply by calling the NHS 111 advice line.",
      "\"A service like this can make a huge difference, providing equipment, responsive visits as well as telephone advice and signposting to other services,\" adds Dr Cox.",
      "And better training for non-specialist staff is also essential, Dr Cox and Dr Clarke agree.",
      "\"My utopia would be that you don't actually need lots of specialist palliative care services because everybody is so good at supporting patients at the end of life,\" adds Dr Clarke.",
      "\"If we were able to support people in the community properly, it would be better for them and would actually cost the NHS less.\"",
      "She adds: \"We need to prioritise this - you only die once.\"",

      "Scientists believe they have discovered how the cheap painkiller aspirin can stop cancers spreading.",
      "In animal experiments they showed the drug enhanced the ability of the immune system to fight back.",
      "The team at the University of Cambridge said it was an exciting and surprise discovery that could eventually lead to cancer patients being prescribed the drug - but not yet and people are advised against just taking the pills themselves.",
      "Regular aspirin comes with risks and trials are still trying to figure out which patients are most likely to benefit.",
      "Tantalising data from more than a decade ago showed people who were already taking a daily aspirin were more likely to survive if they were diagnosed with cancer.",
      "But how?",
      "It appears to centre on a moment of vulnerability for a cancer - when a lone cell breaks off from the original tumour and tries, like a seed on the wind, to spread elsewhere in the body.",
      "This process is called metastasis and is the cause of the majority of deaths from cancer.",
      "Part of our immune defences - a white blood cell called a T-cell - can swoop in and destroy the spreading cancer as it tries to take root.",
      "But the study showed that another part of our blood - the platelets that normally stop bleeding - were suppressing the T-cells and making it harder for them to take out the cancer.",
      "Aspirin disrupts the platelets and removes their influence over the T-cells so they can hunt out the cancer.",
      "Prof Rahul Roychoudhuri, from the University of Cambridge, told me: \"What we've discovered is that aspirin might work, surprisingly, by unleashing the power of the immune system to recognize and kill metastasizing cancer cells.\"",
      "He thinks the drug would work best in cancers that have been caught early and could be used after treatment such as surgery to help the immune system find any cancer that might already have spread.",
      "Should I take aspirin for cancer?",
      "The most natural question for anybody with cancer to ask is should they be taking aspirin.",
      "\"If you are a cancer patient, don't rush to your local pharmacy to buy aspirin just yet, but actively consider participation in ongoing or upcoming trials of aspirin,\" says Prof Mangesh Thorat, a surgeon and cancer researcher at Queen Mary University of London.",
      "He says the study provided \"the missing piece of the jigsaw puzzle\" in understanding how aspirin works, but there were still questions to answer.",
      "Aspirin can cause dangerous internal bleeding including strokes so the risks have to be balanced. It is also not clear whether the effect works for all cancer or just specific ones. And this is still animal research so while the scientists think this would apply in people that will still need to be confirmed.",
      "Some patients - with Lynch syndrome, which increases the risk of cancers - are already recommended aspirin.",
      "But it will still take proper clinical trials to understand whether more patients would benefit too.",
      "These are already under way. Prof Ruth Langley, from the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at University College London, is leading the Add-Aspirin trial to see if aspirin can stop early stage cancers from coming back.",
      "She said the study's results were \"an important discovery\" as they would help to work out \"who is most likely to benefit from aspirin after a cancer diagnosis\".",
      "However, she again warned of the risks of taking aspirin and to \"always talk to your doctor before starting\".",
      "In the long-run, Prof Roychoudhuri suspects new drugs would be developed that take the benefits of aspirin, but with fewer of the risky side-effects.",

      "Instead, some at-home tests are marketed online as a way to \"screen\" for the disease, language the regulator says would be acceptable under the current rules.",

      "A disposable lancet must pierce the skin, before drops of blood can be sucked into a pipette, mixed with a chemical and placed in the test cassette.",
      "Of the five kits analysed by the BBC, one did not produce a readable result; three came back all clear; but one did show a solid dark line, indicating a PSA level above 4.0 ug/l.",
      "A private blood test taken the same day and sent to a laboratory showed a much lower reading of 0.27 ug/l.",
      "\"As your experience shows, these rapid tests appear to have questionable accuracy,\" says Amy Rylance, assistant director of health improvement at Prostate Cancer UK.",
      "\"That's a big problem because they can falsely reassure people who really do have elevated levels of PSA and should seek further testing, or they can cause undue worry among people who are absolutely fine.\"",
      "Online reviews appear to bear that out.",
      "In one, a customer posted that he was \"really scared\" after two rapid home tests indicated a high PSA level. A later NHS test showed his reading was normal.",
      "In another one-star review, a woman wrote that her husband took two home tests for \"peace of mind\" and both were negative. An NHS blood test then showed high levels of PSA and he was diagnosed with stage four prostate cancer.",
      "The British In Vitro Diagnostics Association, which represents the blood testing industry, says that while home tests are appropriate in many circumstances, \"this particular type of [PSA] test may not give an accurate indication of prostate health when taken outside the NHS\".",
      "Instead it says men concerned they may have cancer should see their GP.",
      "In the NHS, doctors often use PSA testing as part of a wider consultation about prostate health, bringing in other risk factors like age, ethnicity and family history.",
      "Dr Sam Merriel, a GP and prostate cancer researcher at the University of Manchester, says a full NHS laboratory test can give a far more detailed picture than a cheap home kit that is either positive or negative.",
      "\"The actual PSA reading is really important to understand because, as a GP, if I saw a PSA of 4.0 I'd be treating that very differently from a PSA of 400,\" he adds.",
      "\"You just don't get that level of information from a fast home test, so patients might not get the full picture.\"",
      "'Dangerously outdated'",
      "Prostate Cancer UK describes the growth of home testing as \"the symptom of a wider problem\".",
      "\"Too many men still don't realise they can access tests through a GP and the guidelines for doctors are dangerously outdated,\" says Amy Rylance from the charity.",
      "Sir Chris Hoy has been calling for the age to be lowered at which those at higher risk, such as black men or those with a family history, can ask their GP for PSA testing.",
      "The government says current guidelines should not stop doctors from offering a test under the age of 50, but critics say the rules are unclear and there are huge variations in diagnosis rates between GP surgeries.",
      "Prostate Cancer UK has also been calling for a change to allow medics to proactively talk to higher risk patients about the pros and cons of testing instead of waiting for them to come forward.",
      "A spokesman for the Department of Health says it has asked the UK National Screening Committee, which advises the NHS, to review the evidence on testing, with a response expected later this year.",

    "story": [
      "An autistic woman with a learning disability was wrongly locked up in a mental health hospital for 45 years, starting when she was just seven years old, the BBC has learned.",
      "The woman, who is believed to be originally from Sierra Leone, and who was given the name Kasibba by the local authority to protect her identity, was also held on her own in long-term segregation for 25 years.",
      "Kasibba is non-verbal and had no family to speak up for her. A clinical psychologist told File on 4 Investigates how she had begun a nine-year battle to release her.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care told the BBC it was unacceptable that so many disabled people were still being held in mental health hospitals and said it hoped reforms to the Mental Health Act would prevent inappropriate detention.",
      "More than 2,000 autistic people and people with learning disabilities are still detained in mental health hospitals in England - including about 200 children. For years, the government has pledged to move many of them into community care, because they do not have any mental illness.",
      "The government promised to take action after a BBC undercover investigation in 2011 exposed the criminal abuse of people with learning disabilities at Winterbourne View private hospital near Bristol.",
      "But all key targets in England have been missed. In the past few weeks, in its plan for 2025-26, NHS England said it aimed to reduce the reliance on mental health inpatient care for people with a learning disability and autistic people, delivering a minimum 10% reduction.",
      "However, Dan Scorer, head of policy and public affairs at the charity Mencap, is not impressed. \"Hundreds of people are still languishing, detained, who should have been freed and should be supported in the community, because we haven't seen the progress that was promised,\" he told us.",
      "Dr Patsie Staite learned of Kasibba's incarceration in 2013 when she was a rookie clinical psychologist carrying out a routine review of her care. But it would take nine years to free her.",
      "\"I hadn't ever seen anyone living in the situation that she was living in. And I think what was really shocking was it was all legitimised,\" Dr Staite told the BBC. She said the apparently legitimate hospital setting masked the reality that Kasibba \"was locked up for sometimes more than 23 hours a day\".",
      "Returning to the site of the hospital - which cannot be named to help protect Kasibba's identity - Dr Staite pointed out a hole in the fence. It had been cut out, she said, so Kasibba could watch people walking by from the outside space of the locked annex where she was held.",
      "It is thought Kasibba, who is now in her 50s, was trafficked from Sierra Leone before the age of five. She lived in a children's home for a while, but that placement broke down and, by the age of seven, she was moved into the long-stay hospital.",
      "Dr Staite said that staff had described Kasibba as \"dangerous\" and an \"eye-gouger\".",
      "She discovered a single incident in the records which appeared to have led to these accusations of violence. Decades earlier, when Kasibba was 19 and before she was placed in long-term segregation, a fire alarm had gone off and the locked ward was being evacuated.",
      "Kasibba was distressed and, in the confusion, she was approached by another patient. She scratched her, causing a cut to the other patient's eye.",
      "\"That was how the incident was talked about ever since, 'she's an eye gouger and she caused so much harm to this other person',\" said Dr Staite. But \"it just didn't ring true\", she said, that a middle-aged woman with a learning disability who had lived in the hospital for decades could be that dangerous.",
      "After months of work, Dr Staite submitted a 50-page report to Camden Council - the local authority in north London which had originally placed Kasibba in the hospital. Dr Staite said it had already been accepted that Kasibba did not have a mental illness and her report concluded she was not dangerous and was safe to live in the community.",
      "A team of health and social care professionals was then set up in 2016, calling themselves \"the escape committee\". Their mission was to free Kasibba.",
      "Lucy Dunstan, from disability rights organisation Changing Our Lives, was appointed to be Kasibba's independent advocate and to build a compelling case for why it was safe for her to leave the hospital.",
      "But Kasibba's release could only be signed off by the Court of Protection, which makes decisions for people who do not have the mental capacity to make their own.",
      "Ms Dunstan said when she first met Kasibba, hospital staff simply introduced her as \"the eye-gouger\".",
      "She said she recalls looking at Kasibba through a small window in the door that kept her locked in. \"She was just lying on the the settee. It was a very empty room. Her life was completely impoverished,\" she said.",
      "It would be six years from first having met Kasibba before Ms Dunstan got a call to tell her that the Court of Protection had ruled she could leave hospital. \"I cried. Joy. Relief. Admiration for her. Pride,\" she said. \"It's not about me and what we did, but that she did it and she showed them.\"",
      "Now Kasibba lives in the community with the help of support workers, who engage with her and communicate with gentle touches, gestures and clear language. Her care manager said she loved fashion, was proud of her home and enjoyed social interaction.",
      "\"She has the most amazing sense of humour. She's a beautiful human being,\" the manager said. \"After about two weeks of working here she actually came up and gave me a hug. This is not an eye-gouger, you know.\"",
      "The Mental Health Bill going through parliament will mean autistic people and those with learning disabilities in England and Wales, who do not have a mental health condition, will no longer be able to be detained for treatment.",
      "But the government has said it will not bring in any changes until it is satisfied there is sufficient alternative support in the community. And it will still allow people to be detained in hospital legally for up to 28 days for assessment.",
      "Jess McGregor, executive director of adults and health at Camden Council, said it was a \"tragedy\" that Kasibba had spent most of her life held in hospital. \"I'm personally sorry,\" she said. \"She shouldn't have experienced what she did.\"",
      "The NHS mental health trust, which cannot be named to protect Kasibba's identity, said at no point had the care it delivered been brought into question and the service was rated as outstanding by the Care Quality Commission.",
      "The trust told File on 4 Investigates that anyone assessed as needing long-term segregation had a self-contained property with their own bedroom, bathroom, living room and garden.",
      "The trust said from 2010 it had been working with local authorities to put plans in place to support the discharge of all long-term residents to more appropriate care, where possible within the community, but said they were prevented from doing so by a legal case brought by the families of other patients.",
      "It said its staff had then worked tirelessly for years supporting local authorities to put the necessary support in place in the community and they were able to successfully close the service in 2023."

      "\"It was like a fist; you know how babies make a fist? Then his index finger; his thumb was sticking out.",
      "\"I just kept thinking, 'He's here because of me,' and you just look for blame. You look, and the first person you are going to blame is yourself.\"",
      "At 14, doctors discovered a tumour in George's hand so large that amputation became a real possibility.",
      "The surgery, experimental at the time, was gruelling. \"When I woke up, I was so full of morphine,\" he remembers.",
      "\"They said it was like climbing Everest with no practice \u2013 my body just shut down.\"",
      "The experience, particularly the smell, left lasting memories. \"They burn flesh as they [operate]: very quiet sizzling, like sausages in a pan. And that's the smell that still comes to you from time to time.\"",

      "Doctors reassured Lisa, saying the only thing she would not be able to do was play the piano.",
      "Just as Fiona Taylor did with George, Lisa initially questioned whether she was responsible for her daughter's condition.",
      "\"There was probably part of me that sat there and went, 'What did I do? Did I do this?'\" she says.",
      "\"Because I've had a couple of miscarriages before Simone... I always thought maybe I was lucky; maybe I was given Simone... but she wasn't quite perfect. But I was lucky to have had that baby and not the two previous ones.\"",

      "\"You're let out into the world with a child that's a little bit different,\" she says.",
      "\"But there was nowhere to go. There was no follow-up or anything, no 'We're going to look into it.' So you just deal with it. And you did, because you had to.\"",
      "Lisa quickly adjusted to life with Simone's condition, saying: \"It shocked other people more than it shocked me. I got used to it really, really quickly.\"",
      "Winning the subsequent legal case against the borough council brought with it overwhelming attention.",
      "\"I'm not famous, but I feel like that's how famous people must feel... It was crazy.\"",
      "Growing up, Simone, now 35, faced relentless bullying.",
      "\"I had a great family and friends... but [school] was hard. I wasn't a very confident child, and I was an easy target,\" she remembers.",

      "\"It was a bit of a front, because if I make a joke about myself, nobody else can. Just accept that's who you are; it's not going to change.\"",
      "At 18, she was offered surgery to reshape her hands, but declined.",

    "summary": "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis of death certificate data carried out for BBC News.",
    "story": [
      "The UK death rate reached a record low last year, according to exclusive analysis carried out for BBC News.",
      "Mortality experts looked at death certificates registered in 2024 and found that deaths per head of the population had returned to pre-pandemic levels and were slightly below the previous record in 2019.",
      "However, the new figure puts the UK back on its long-term trend of only gradual improvement.",
      "The research was carried out by analysts from the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) at the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.",
      "What's been happening to death rates?",
      "\"This is five years of basically flat mortality improvement, it's pretty poor by historical standards,\" said Stuart McDonald from the CMI.",
      "There was also a \"concerning\" rise in the death rate at young working ages, he said.",
      "A Department of Health spokesperson said the government was \"shifting focus from sickness to prevention\".",
      "The registered death rate in the UK steadily halved from 1974 to 2011 largely driven by improvements in tackling heart disease, including smoking prevention and medical advances.",
      "From 2011 to 2019 the improvements drastically slowed, then changed direction during Covid as thousands more people died than normal. The first post-pandemic year of 2022 also saw high numbers of extra deaths.",
      "To calculate the record low 2024 UK figure of 989 deaths per 100,000 people, analysts at the CMI used provisional weekly death registration figures for the four nations of the UK.",
      "\"Clearly, it's very good news that our mortality rate is lower in 2024 than it was,\" says Dr Veena Raleigh, epidemiologist at health think tank The King's Fund. \"But if you look at the broader canvas then it's not so good.\"",
      "Although similar countries also experienced a slowdown since 2011, the UK's has been more severe and our life expectancy is at the \"bottom of the pack of comparable countries,\" she says, adding that nations such as Spain returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023.",
      "Causes and risk factors",
      "Researchers point to a variety of reasons behind the slowdown since 2011. Some of the \"low hanging fruit\" of improvements in heart disease and cancer, such as the cut in smoking rates, had already happened, making further gains harder.",
      "At the same time, the UK saw rising risk factors, including obesity, poor diet and low levels of exercise, against a backdrop of widening social inequality and pressure on the NHS.",
      "Some academics argue that austerity cuts to public services after the 2008 financial crash had a strong impact on life expectancy, while others say it's not possible to prove this directly.",
      "Dementia and Alzheimer's disease is the leading cause of death in England and Wales, according to the latest official figures. Heart disease, lung disease, strokes, lung cancer also feature highly, along with flu in some years.",
      "\"Cardiovascular disease remains a leading killer in the UK,\" said Prof Bryan Williams OBE, chief scientific and medical officer at the British Heart Foundation.",
      "\"The plateau we have seen in reducing the number of deaths... is a serious cause for concern, made worse by the impact of the pandemic on an already overstretched health service.\"",
      "He added that early deaths from cardiovascular disease had grown in the most deprived areas of England and called for \"urgent government action\" in its prevention, detection and treatment.",
      "Deaths at younger ages",
      "Overall death rates are largely a reflection of older people's health as more than three-quarters of UK deaths happen over the age of 70.",
      "So the main trend is driven by what is happening to people in this age group.",
      "But the CMI found \"really significant differences\" at younger ages says Stuart McDonald, with a \"concerning\" upward trend in mortality among 20-44-year-olds.",
      "\"For this age group, death rates have actually been going up slightly, even before the pandemic. If we go back to 2011 we can see a slight increase in death rates year-on-year.\"",
      "UK men and women can expect to live longer, data show",
      "Life expectancy is down but what does this mean?",
      "UK life expectancy progress 'has stopped'",
      "Death numbers among this age group are much lower than at older ages and the causes tend to be different. Fewer than 20,000 people aged 20-44 die in the UK each year, about 3% of all deaths.",
      "\"External and substance-related causes are most important because often that's what people die of in this age group,\" says Antonino Polizzi, researcher at the Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"Things like drug overdoses, alcohol-related deaths, accidents, homicides and suicides.\"",
      "The UK, particularly Scotland, has seen a rise in drug-related death rates, he says.",
      "\"These causes are usually improving for other Western European countries so we are seeing a divergent effect.\"",
      "Commenting on the overall trends at all age groups, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We inherited an NHS that was broken and we are determined to fix it.",
      "\"Through our Plan for Change we are shifting focus from sickness to prevention and targeting the drivers of ill health and catching the biggest killers earlier.",
      "\"We are creating the first smoke free generation, stopping junk food ads being targeted at children and improving detection of diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\"",
      "About the data",
      "The CMI took weekly provisional death registration data from the Office for National Statistics, for England and Wales, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and calculated the 2024 rate.",
      "The rate is age-standardised, which means that you can make comparisons with other years even though the UK population as a whole is getting older.",
      "Changes to the death registration process may mean that more 2024 deaths are registered in 2025 than was the case for the previous year, but the CMI says this is not the main explanation for the return to the pre-pandemic trend.",

      "It is a frequent source of complaints from patients who often find themselves held in long queues, only to be told all the appointments have been booked up.",
      "Not all surgeries work like this though, with others operating telephone call-back services or online triage so that patients can be prioritised.",
      "The new contract\u00a0says patients should be able to arrange appointments online throughout working hours, freeing up the phones for those who need them most, and making it easier for practices to triage patients based on medical need.",

      "Dr Katie Bramall-Stainer, who chairs the BMA GPs' committee, says this contract is a good start, but more work is needed.",
      "\"We have shown that we want to work in good faith with this government and build on this new beginning \u2013 what we now need is certainty about our collective future.",

      "Dr Bramall-Stainer told BBC Breakfast general practice had been pushed to \"desperation point\" over the last 15 years - with \"thousands\" of GPs leaving.",
      "She explained the \"first signs of green shoots\" patients might see following the new agreed measures would include being able to get to know their doctor and local staff and surgeries advertising for more staff.",
      "She indicated patients would \"potentially\" begin to notice a difference in six to 12 months but insisted that, although a step in the right direction, these new measures are \"nowhere near a solution\".",
      "Dr Steve Taylor, a locum GP in Manchester and spokesperson from the lobbying group Doctors' Association UK, said he fears much of the extra money will have to go towards national insurance contributions, staff and running costs.",

She says he was prescribed a high dose to enable him to regain weight after losing four stone in hospital, but it became increasingly difficult to get hold of the medicine.",
      "\"We started to have trouble getting them in the higher dosage, involving me traipsing round pharmacies to find one who could get them. Pharmacies cannot get hold of that dosage. He now has to take a lower dose doubling up on the number of tablets taken, one box now lasts less than a week.",

      "There are other forms of Pert, but the charities and medical experts say while other countries have many brands available, in the UK creon \"holds a very high market share\".

      "The Conservatives have called for the government to overrule planned changes which would make the ethnicity or faith of an offender a bigger factor when deciding whether to jail them.",
      "The Sentencing Council, which issued the new guidance for England and Wales, is independent and ministers do not currently have the power to override it.",
      "But shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC that if necessary, the law should be changed so the government could do so.",
      "Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said she will write to the council to \"register my displeasure\" and recommend reversing the change, after the Tories accused her of overseeing \"two-tier justice\".",
      "\"As someone who is from an ethnic minority background myself, I do not stand for any differential treatment before the law, for anyone of any kind,\" Mahmood said.",
      "\"There will never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch.\"",
      "Downing Street said the prime minister backed the justice secretary's comments, adding that the \"updated guidelines don't represent the views of the government\".",
      "The Sentencing Council said the guidance would ensure courts had the \"most comprehensive information available\" to hand out an appropriate sentence and could address disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system.",
      "Official figures show that offenders from ethnic minorities consistently get longer sentences than white offenders for indictable offences.",

      "Or they allow the guidelines to take effect, facing accusations from the Conservatives that they are not willing to do everything possible to stop something they themselves have described as \"two-tier\".",
      "That \"two-tier\" phrase is especially highly-charged. The government regards that accusation as politically toxic and is desperate to repel any suggestion of two-tier justice.",
      "The updated sentencing guidance, which is due to come into force from April, places a greater emphasis on the need for pre-sentence reports for judges.",
      "Pre-sentence reports give judges details on the offender's background, motives and personal life before sentencing - then recommend a punishment and what would work best for rehabilitation.",
      "But over recent years their use has decreased.",
      "Magistrates and judges will be advised to get a pre-sentence report before handing out punishment for someone of an ethnic or faith minority - alongside other groups such as young adults, abuse survivors and pregnant women.",
      "These factors are not an exhaustive list, the council said. A pre-sentence report can still be necessary if an individual does not fall into one of these cohorts.",
      "However, Jenrick said this was a \"blanket approach\" that in many cases could lead to lesser sentences for certain groups.",
      "He argued this could undermine the principle of equality of treatment under the law.",
      "The shadow justice secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mahmood had a representative at a meeting signing off the changes, who did not raise any objections.",
      "The previous Conservative government was also consulted on the sentencing changes when the council was considering reforms between November 2023 and February 2024.",
      "Pressed over why the Conservatives did not challenge the planned changes when they were in power, Jenrick said \"there was no direction or requirement by government\" for the council to investigate the issue.",
      "He added that draft guidance had adopted less of a blanket approach, only saying a judge may produce a pre-sentencing report, rather than requiring them to do so.",
      "However, he said the justice secretary at the time, Alex Chalk, had branded the idea \"ridiculous and patronising\".",
      "On Wednesday, Jenrick claimed the new guidelines were biased \"against straight white men\".",
      "\"Under Two-Tier Keir [Starmer] our justice system is set to have an anti-white and anti-Christian bias,\" he wrote on social media.",
      "Sentencing Council chairman Lord Justice William Davis said the updated guidelines took into account \"evidence of disparities in sentencing outcomes, disadvantages faced within the criminal justice system and complexities in circumstances of individual offenders\".",
      "He added: \"Pre-sentence reports provide the court with information about the offender; they are not an indication of sentence.\"",
      "The Prison Reform Trust said there were \"very good reasons\" for changes to sentencing guidelines.",
      "Mark Daly, the charity's deputy director, told Radio 4's The World Tonight: \"It has always been a factor that has been on the mind of sentencers and in this guideline it is simply reflecting the fact that if we look at outcomes from sentencing, there is disproportionality.",

      "Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.",
      "Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.",

      "It covers not only the mistakes he thinks he made, but also the disagreements about the right way to manage the economy that he had with Boris Johnson; the radical ideas he wishes he could've implemented; the lessons he learned from being chancellor during the Covid pandemic - and his attitudes to race and faith and Englishness as the first British Asian prime minister.",
      "Sunak is in reflective mood talking about a job he was catapulted into, saying he didn't \"probably have the time to enjoy it in the moment or appreciate it in the moment because of the context in which I was doing it.\"",
      "That context was not just an economic crisis but a political one.",

      "'Stop the boats' slogan was error, says Cleverly",
      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",

      "Four days later, he walked into Number 10 as her successor.",
      "He says he \"had very mixed feelings\u2026given what had happened\" but was driven by Hindu belief in dharma which he says involves \"doing your duty\".",

      "\"It was a very helpful concept for me\u2026I kept coming back to that. I said, 'look, this is my job. This is what I'm here to do. I'm well-placed to try and solve the economic challenge that our country is facing'.\"",
      "Bringing the economy back under control after the markets panicked in the face of Truss's unfunded tax cuts \u2013 or what he calls \"fantasy economics\" - is the achievement he's clearly proudest of.",
      "However, he spells out for the first time the scale of the disagreements he had not just with Truss, but with Boris Johnson, who he served as Chancellor.",
      "\"He and I had quite different views on economic policy. I'm a small state conservative. I believe in prioritising, trying to restrain the growth of public spending, being careful with our borrowing so that we can cut people's taxes...he was less worried about those things.\"",
      "He tells me that at their regular Sunday night dinners in Downing Street they argued over what could and could not be afforded.",
      "He says his worries were inflation and interest rates rising, because \"when they go up it's going to have a big impact on our public finances, because we're going to have to pay more to service the debt that we've got\".",
      "He adds: \"We cannot afford to keep spending and borrowing at this rate, and that means you have to prioritise. We can't do everything.\"",
      "Sunak insisted that any plan to subsidise people's social care costs had to be paid for by higher taxes.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 11:07:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The announcement of new support for courts comes as two reports warn the justice system is struggling.",
    "story": [
      "Ministers have pledged to increase the number of days funded for judges hearing criminal cases in an attempt to cut unprecedented backlogs and delays in Crown Courts in England and Wales.",
      "The Ministry of Justice's announcement follows two highly critical reports which found victims of crime were being failed.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said some victims were so traumatised by delays they had resorted to drugs, alcohol and self-harm.",
      "The funding boosts the total number of sitting days for judges to 110,000 in the new financial year, up from 108,000. But the justice secretary has admitted it is still not enough to handle the record backlog in the courts.",
      "There are currently 73,000 unresolved prosecutions, and this number is expected to rise, said Shabana Mahmood.",
      "Suspects being charged with new offences are regularly told there might not be a trial until 2027, and some courts are already looking for diary space in 2028.",
      "The delays - which have been caused by a combination of cuts to courts, the pandemic and then a barristers' strike over pay - have also led to a record 17,000 defendants being held on remand, taking up one-fifth of spaces in the crisis-ridden jails.",
      "Last November, Baroness Sue Carr, the Lady Chief Justice, told Parliament there needed to be more days given to judges and she had enough judges available to sit for 113,000 days a year in court.",
      "She said a cap on sitting days had a \"drastic effect\", with her local leaders having to reschedule cases and cancel work given to part-time judges, who are critical to clearing the backlog.",
      "A review into how to speed up the criminal courts is ongoing. Mahmood on Wednesday said the increase to the new level in sitting days was \"unprecedented\", but said it would still not be enough to fix the problem.",
      "\"The sheer number of cases coming into the system means that the demand is very high and the backlog, without further policy change, is still going to rise,\" she told the Today programme.",
      "\"We are determined to deliver swifter justice for victims, far too many of whom are paying the price for these delays in our courts,\" she added.",
      "But two reports have raised questions about how quickly the government is acting.",
      "Victims Commissioner Baroness Newlove said in a report published on Tuesday that justice felt \"out of reach\" for many victims, which was causing extra trauma.",
      "One woman, who had suffered sexual abuse, tried to take her own life after the trial of her attacker was put back.",
      "Baroness Newlove urged the government to reverse a planned cut of around 4% to crucial victim support services, which she warned were under \"immense pressure\" because delays meant they are dealing with more clients than ever.",
      "\"With funding cuts looming, we face the very real threat of reduced support,\" she said.",
      "\"I fear this will drive some victims to give up on seeking justice altogether - a second injustice compounding the first.\"",
      "Separately, Parliament's Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned that the MoJ had \"accepted\" court delays getting worse until recommendations from the major review into reforming the courts, led by retired judge Sir Brian Leveson, were implemented.",
      "The report said that the courts could not keep up with the rate of new cases arriving at their doors.",
      "Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the committee's chair, said: \"Our report is a terrible indictment of our criminal justice system and the government urgently need to reorganise it to aspire to that world-class standard for which the UK used to be renowned.\"",
      "Mary Prior KC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association, which represents barristers, said that 110,000 sitting days was the minimum that had been needed since 2022.",
      "\"We welcome these additional sitting days... but to do our collective best to reduce the backlog we must ask for uncapped sitting days in the Crown Court for at least the next five years.\"",
      "Joanna Hardy-Susskind, a defence barrister and host of BBC Radio 4 justice series You Do Not Have to Say Anything, said the extra sitting days would only go so far to improve a system where the length of \"queues for justice\" were \"unacceptable\".",
      "\"This is a lifeboat, and it will help a little - but not for long,\" she told the BBC's Today programme.",
      "She added that the state of courtrooms were in \"a pretty dire way\", and funding was also needed for upkeep.",
      "\"There's not much point in opening courtrooms if I'm sitting there and the ceiling is leaking on my wig - if juror number four is sitting there in a hat and scarf because they're freezing and concentrate on a murder trial or on a rape trial,\" she said."

      "Government politicians needed the help of one opposition MS - Dodds was won over after ministers promised a ban on greyhound racing and \u00a31 bus fares for under-21s.",
      "The Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru opposed the package, which cover the next financial year.",
      "Labour MSs banged Senedd tables as the result of the vote came in with 29 Senedd members in support and 28 against, with one abstention from Dodds.",

      "Welsh Labour had been searching for a deal after the Plaid Cymru co-operation pact came to an end last summer.",
      "If the budget had not been not agreed the Welsh government's funds - which mostly come from the Treasury - would be automatically cut, with potentially \u00a34.15bn over the course of a financial year at stake.",
      "Under the previous Labour first minister Vaughan Gething it had been unclear how a deal could be achieved with all other parties ruling out working with him.",

      "'If you succeeded everything would be lost'",
      "Opening the debate on his budget, Drakeford said: \"Today with this budget, we turned the corner, moving beyond austerity to investment and to growth.",
      "\"While we cannot undo all the damage inflicted on Wales during the austerity years we can begin to rebuild our services and create an economy which truly offers prosperity for all.\"",
      "Attacking the Tories and Plaid Cymru, Drakeford told the Senedd: \"There is no other budget that can be endorsed here this afternoon.\"",
      "He said voting against it was a \"vote against\" extra treatments in the NHS, the employment of teachers, extra child care places and other policies.",
      "Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth intervened and accused Drakeford of a \"spurious argument\".",
      "\"Whilst we can agree with elements of the budget, of course we can \u2013 this is a flawed Labour budget.\"",
      "Drakeford responded: \"If you were to succeed everything I have outlined this afternoon would be lost.\"",
      "The two later clashed on how much they had tried to negotiate. Drakeford said Plaid had not been \"prepared\" to so, claiming to have met a party spokesperson three times. He said the party did not \"return to discuss what you would have wanted in order to be able to have allowed this budget to go through\".",
      "Ap Iorwerth said he had been in a meeting with Drakeford \"who didn't mention how we could work together on their budget\".",

      "\"Let's be clear about this - if the Welsh government lost this vote today, it would effectively bring to an end twenty six years of a failing tired, clapped out Labour government that is devoid of the right ideas to fix the problems and the challenges that Wales faces.\"",
      "His finance spokesman Sam Rowlands said the budget was \"merely a sticking plaster over the problems that far too many people face in Wales\".",
      "\"It won't lead to greater prosperity for our people. It won't put more money in people's pockets and it won't give us the public services that the people of Wales are crying out for.\"",
      "Plaid Cymru's Heledd Fychan said the budget \"falls short of adequately addressing challenges we face as a nation\".",
      "If the budget passed, she said, \"services that people depend on will continue to be cut, some will disappear entirely. Council tax will rise significantly\".",

      "She reiterated Plaid demands for finance reform and extra funding from the Labour UK government.",
      "She said the budget lacked a \"single penny\" of consequential funding from High Speed Rail 2. \"Where is the fair funding formula,\" she asked.",

      "\"But I am proud of the key victories of the Welsh Liberal Democrats.\"",
      "A Wales spokesman for Reform UK, which is hoping to win its first MSs at the next election in 2026, had called for the budget to be rejected, saying it \"did nothing to fix our struggling economy, failing public services, or the cost-of-living crisis\".",
      "Analysis",
      "By Gareth Lewis, BBC Wales political editor",
      "Labour is asking voters to stick with it \u2013 in Wales and in Westminster \u2013  and to allow time for public services to improve.",
      "That could be a challenge, with forecasts suggesting tighter public spending in future years, low economic growth in the UK and global economic and political uncertainty \u2013 all of which could mean less money coming from Westminster for Welsh ministers to spend.",
      "And what if voters simply want change after what will be 27 years of Labour in power come the 2026 Senedd election?",
      "The other parties sense that change in the air and will spend the next year arguing that two Labour governments working together are not doing enough for Wales and that the Welsh government's spending priorities are wrong.",
      "Labour for its part tried to put Plaid on the defensive during the budget debate, accusing it of jeopardising billions of pounds of funding by not backing the spending plans."

    "story": [
      "New leasehold flats in England and Wales are set to be banned under the latest government plans to reform home ownership.",
      "Under the current leasehold system, third-party landlords known as freeholders own the building and a leaseholder buys the right to occupy a flat within it for a fixed time period.",
      "The government says it wants to move to a system of home ownership that is more in line with the rest of the world, known as commonhold, where homeowners own a share of and have control over buildings they live in.",
      "Freeholders say leasehold is the \"most effective way of managing large complex apartment buildings\".",
      "The government has yet to set out specific plans for the conversion of current leasehold properties to commonhold, but says it is \"determined\" to make this easier.",
      "A white paper published on Monday stated the sale of new leasehold flats would be banned and commonhold \"reinvigorated\" with a new legal framework.",
      "A draft Leasehold and Commonhold Reform Bill - including the detail of how the new system would work - will be published later this year, the government has said.",
      "The new legislation would apply in England and Wales. There are an estimated five million leasehold properties in England, 70% of which are flats.",
      "Housing Minister Matthew Pennycook told the BBC the current system is \"inherently unfair\" and reforms are needed to give leaseholders \"better control\" over their homes and associated costs.",
      "Existing leaseholders can feel like they have no control over costs for repairs and maintenance of the outside of their building.",
      "Around 1,000 people contacted the BBC after a BBC investigation about service charges in leasehold blocks last year.",
      "Kasia Tarker bought a one-bedroom flat in Southall, West London, in 2022.",
      "Her service charge bills have increased from roughly \u00a365 per month in 2022 to more than \u00a3200 per month this year.",
      "She said she felt helpless and could not afford the charges.",
      "\"I am going have to try and sell the flat or become homeless, I don't know what I am going to do.\"",
      "FirstPort, who took over management of Kasia's development in 2023, said the \"increases in areas such as insurance and health and safety costs\" were beyond its control.",
      "Kasia said she would like more control over her service charges but the government's commonhold proposals were for new builds, so would not help her in her current situation.",
      "Jean Hopkin, another leaseholder who got in touch with the BBC, said the service charge for her three-bedroom flat in Sheffield had increased 356% - from \u00a3106 a month to \u00a3483 in four years - and was unsellable because of the high charges.",
      "Jenny Baker in Southampton is also struggling to find buyers because of \"unjustified\" service charges that have gone up to \u00a37,200 a year.",
      "\"The state of the apartment block is just terrible. The windows don't get cleaned and there's black mould on the outside of the building - what on earth am I paying for?",
      "\"I feel stuck \u2013 I can never come out of it. I feel like I have absolutely no control, and it makes me feel really anxious.\"",
      "Rendall & Rittner, which manage Jean and Jenny's buildings, said the company did \"not profit from or mark up any costs\".",
      "According to property company Hamptons, the amount of money leaseholders pay for communal maintenance and services in their building has risen by 11% in England and Wales between 2023 and 2024 to an average of \u00a32,300.",
      "Companies responsible for managing buildings have said a rise in costs can be attributed to legitimate expenses including energy prices and higher inflation rates but many leaseholders felt the costs were unfair.",
      "Under the current system, it is the freeholder or landlord that appoints a managing agent. Under a commonhold system, residents would have more autonomy over what they pay and who they appoint to do maintenance, the government said.",
      "What is the difference between leasehold and commonhold?",
      "A leasehold property reverts to the freeholder after a fixed amount of time. A commonhold property is owned outright, like a freehold house.Under commonhold, homeowners have a say on the annual budget for their building. Under the leasehold system, a freeholder or landlord sends a bill to residents for communal costs. The residents will be able to hire and fire a managing agent.There is no ground rent charge in a commonhold property.Forfeiture is not possible under commonhold, meaning a resident cannot be threatened with losing their home.",

      "Natalie Chambers, director of the Residential Freehold Association (RFA), said the measures \"should not be seen as a trade-off between leasehold and commonhold\".",
      "\"Millions of leaseholders across the country are perfectly content with the tenure and we firmly believe that leasehold is the most effective way of managing large complex apartment building.\"",
      "She added that a commonhold system would mean \"residents would face greater financial and legal responsibilities for block maintenance and management\".",
      "'Significant step'",
      "The National Leasehold Campaign (NLC) said it was \"delighted\" about the announcement and called today's white paper a significant step forward.",
      "But NLC founder Katie Kendrick said it was \"paramount\" that those currently living in leasehold buildings were not forgotten.",
      "She said: \"While focusing on preventing future leasehold abuses is crucial, it's equally vital to address the plight of existing leaseholders currently bound by the inequitable leasehold system.",
      "\"Commonhold conversion mechanisms are essential to offer an escape route for those trapped.\"",
      "Mr Pennycook said the government would \"continue to implement reforms to help millions of leaseholders who are currently suffering\".",
      "\"Want we don't want is a two-tier system,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"All existing leaseholders in blocks will be able to convert to commonhold,\" he said, adding the government will introduce a system that makes it \"very easy\" to do so, with a draft plan set to be outlined later this year.",
      "He acknowledged there will be a \"remnant of existing leasehold blocks\" once the ban on new leaseholds is brought in and a new system to convert existing leaseholds to commonhold is brought in, but said those remaining leaseholders will still have \"greater protections\".",
      "In 2023, Conservative housing secretary Michael Gove expressed a desire to abolish the leasehold system entirely, but later opted for reforms instead.",
      "Several of these reforms have now been implemented, including the end of a \"two-year\" rule on extending a lease, and new rules on the right-to-manage properties in a mixed-use building.",

      "\"The government's impact assessment did not produce compelling evidence on the day-one rights issue, so there may yet be unforeseen consequences.\"",

      "\"The new rate is good for workers and fair on businesses as part our plan to boost rights and make work pay, while delivering our plan for change,\" Kendall said.",

      "More workers to get sick pay and parental leave rights",
      "The change to sick pay is part of a number of updates to the Employment Rights Bill expected to be announced on Tuesday, and aims to keep more people off benefits and boost living standards.",
      "The bill, which was published last year, set out plans to improve sick pay and allow workers greater rights to ask for flexible working and unpaid parental leave.",
      "However, the planned increase in workers' rights, together with the rising minimum wage and hike in employers' National Insurance, has led to criticism from many businesses, who say the combined impact will hit growth and employment.",
      "At the weekend it emerged that the government would not be including the \"right to switch off\" for workers in the bill.",
      "This measure had been proposed to stop employers contacting staff out-of-hours on phones, emails and texts.",
      "A government source told the Sunday Times that: \"The right to switch off is dead. We have to lower business compliance costs as much as possible.\""

      "When asked about the welfare budget, the Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood said: \"Our current situation is unsustainable\u2026 we've seen a huge rise in that welfare budget.\"",
      "BBC Verify has examined this budget and where the cuts might fall.",
      "How big is the welfare budget?",
      "Before looking at where the welfare budget might be cut, it is necessary to understand the size of the budget and how it has grown.",
      "At the time of the October 2024 Budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that total spending on health and disability benefits would rise from \u00a364.7bn in 2023-24 to \u00a3100.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "And the OBR projected that the biggest contributor to this increase would be from welfare spending on working-age adults, defined as those aged between 16 and 64.",
      "The OBR projected spending on this sector would rise from \u00a348.5bn in 2023-24 to \u00a375.7bn in 2029-30.",
      "Why is the welfare bill growing?",
      "The OBR cited rising numbers of people coming on to incapacity and disability benefits as driving its latest forecasts.",
      "The forecaster is essentially assuming the trend of rising benefits claims in recent years will continue.",
      "In the five years after 2009-2010, more people were coming off incapacity benefits than on.",
      "But in recent years - and especially since the 2020-21 Covid pandemic - more people have been coming on to benefits than off them.",
      "And the OBR forecast the share of the working-age population in receipt of an incapacity benefit would rise from 7% in 2024 to a record high of 7.9% in 2029.",
      "The reasons for this are not totally clear.",
      "Some experts point to the damaging and lasting impact of the pandemic on physical health.",
      "Others reference the rise in mental ill health, especially among younger people.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has reported that the number of people aged 18 to 24 who are not in education, employment or training (Neet) rose to 907,000 at the end of last year, a 30% increase on the level before the pandemic in 2020 (although the ONS also cautioned the survey used to collect the data was potentially unreliable).",
      "Other experts place the emphasis on financial incentives in the welfare system - where people can get higher payments for being on sickness benefits than from being unemployed or in low-paid, part-time work.",
      "The standard allowance for a single person on Universal Credit is \u00a3311.68 per month. If someone is deemed to have \"limited capacity for work-related activity\", the criteria to receive incapacity benefits, they are eligible for an extra \u00a3416.19 per month on top.",
      "But there is no consensus on what's causing the trend.",
      "\"It is not yet known what factors are driving this increase,\" says Eduin Latimer of the Institute for Fiscal Studies.",
      "\"Figuring out what is behind the recent rise must surely be a top priority for the government if it is going to be able to respond appropriately.\"",
      "Which elements of the welfare bill might be cut?",
      "Ministers have not said where they will seek cuts, but the largest element of the working-age welfare bill is incapacity or long-term sickness benefits - paid via Universal Credit or the legacy system of Employment and Support Allowance.",
      "If the government wants to make significant savings from the working-age welfare bill it will probably need to find some savings here.",
      "But the second largest single element of the working-age welfare bill is Personal Independence Payments (PIP) - a benefit for people under state pension age who need help with daily activities because of a long-term illness or disability. PIP claimants can be in work.",
      "In 2023-24, PIP totalled \u00a318bn and that's projected to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30. That would mean the number of claimants rising from 2.7 million to 4.2 million.",
      "As with the rise in the overall welfare bill, there's no consensus among experts on what's driving rising PIP claims, but this is also somewhere the government might well look to make some savings.",
      "The previous Conservative government had explored making it harder for younger people with mental health conditions to claim PIP.",
      "Can significant savings be made?",
      "Many experts, such as the Resolution Foundation think tank and the Institute for Employment Studies, agree that more working-age people should be helped and encouraged into work, and that there is a case for reform of the working-age welfare system.",
      "But some argue that making sustainable, long-term savings requires upfront government investment in employment support programmes - schemes which aim to help people overcome barriers to getting into work.",
      "Analysts also warn that reducing spending on the welfare bill has been historically difficult.",
      "At the 2015 general election, the Conservative manifesto promised to cut \u00a312bn from the annual welfare budget.",
      "While some significant savings were initially found, ministers were forced to change policy after a political backlash over some of the cuts.",
      "The OBR later concluded \u00a34bn of the \u00a312bn a year promised cuts had not been achieved.",

    "summary": "The briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant.",
    "story": [
      "The government briefing that Rachel Reeves will make large spending cuts this month is very significant, in several different ways.",
      "First, it confirms what had been rumoured - that the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), the independent forecaster, believes that the chancellor's 'headroom' has been eliminated.",
      "This is the \u00a310bn worth of leeway which, as of last October, the OBR believed the government had before breaking its self-imposed borrowing rules.",
      "Why has that headroom disappeared? The government's clear view is that this is because of global factors  - tariffs being imposed by President Trump, broader uncertainty emanating from the new US administration, persistent inflation in the UK and elsewhere, and the rising cost of government borrowing.",
      "But there will be a big political argument about this.",
      "The Conservatives will contend that the cost of government borrowing was rising even before President Trump took office and that the tax rises in Reeves's Budget in October were a major factor, as well as in stunting growth.",
      "Chancellor set to cut welfare spending by billions",
      "Labour ministers tread carefully as welfare reform looms",
      "What is the OBR and why does it matter?",
      "Relatedly, it is worth stressing that this month was not meant to be a big economic moment for the government.",
      "Over recent years, a fiscal rhythm has developed where there is one Budget a year and then a second (spring or autumn) statement which also contains significant tax and spend measures and is akin to a mini-budget.",
      "Reeves wanted to end that, with an autumn Budget and then a much more limited event in spring at which the OBR published updated forecasts but the government did not respond with major economic measures.",
      "Government sources say that this will not be a fiscal event because it will not include tax rises, only spending cuts.",
      "Yet the Charter for Budget Responsibility, recently updated by the Labour government, said that it was committed to one major fiscal event a year in order to \"give families and business more certainty\" not only about tax but \"spending changes\" too.",
      "The government did reserve the right to change that approach \"in the case of an economic shock\".",
      "Does that mean the government believes the effect of President Trump has been an economic shock?",
      "There are clear political sensitivities in where the cuts are likely to fall. The Labour Party has many factions and ideological nuances but all of its MPs are committed to a generous welfare state and many will be antsy at the prospect of welfare cuts.",
      "Those in government are adamant, though, that the numbers - which are rising fast - of claimants and the amount being spent by government are simply unsustainable.",
      "There will be reform as well as cuts  - Reeves has identified what she sees as \"perverse incentives\" in the system.",
      "In a preview of the potential rows to come, one Labour MP, speaking on the condition of anonymity, was critical, saying: \"There is always money for war, yet none left for the most vulnerable to lift them out of hardship.\"",
      "\"Austerity is a choice. Poverty is a political choice,\" they added.",
      "However others, including from the left of the party, said they recognised the welfare system was \"old fashioned\" and needed reform.",
      "\"We have people who can work but don't just automatically because the system is inflexible,\" one said.",
      "Notably the next target for cuts appears to be the civil service.",
      "Privately ministers and officials have been dismayed by the quality of the Whitehall machine.",
      "The government is expected to demand major reductions in the numbers of civil servants, though this is unlikely to take the form of a specific numerical target.",
      "Ministers are also understood to have discussed major changes to the machinery of government, namely how government departments are organised, though this work is considered unlikely to come to fruition this month."

    "summary": "The prime minister will soon need evidence to show he can be a bridge between Trump and Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine may well prove to be one of the most significant moments in the conflict since Vladimir Putin launched his full-scale invasion.",
      "As far as the UK is concerned, it will not change Sir Keir Starmer's approach, but makes the issues he has been focusing on for the past few days more acute and more urgent.",
      "The prime minister still views his core tasks as finding a way to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together, and drawing up the foundations of a workable peace deal that can be presented to the US.",
      "As we saw in the House of Commons on Monday, where MPs from different parties lined up to laud the prime minister for his sure-footed diplomacy, it is a strategy with broad support across the political spectrum.",
      "But how deep is that support? We may be about to find out.",
      "UK won't be derailed by Ukraine aid freeze - Rayner",
      "Ukraine's shock over US military aid pause",
      "It is one thing for the prime minister to vow to do all he can to bring presidents Trump and Zelensky back together.",
      "But to be a bridge between both countries, Sir Keir will in time need evidence that he has influence on both sides of that bridge.",
      "Towards the end of his statement in the Commons, the prime minister was asked about US media reports that Trump was considering withdrawing military aid.",
      "He replied that this was not his understanding of the US position. Evidently, this shortly turned out to be wrong.",
      "We now know that at some point later on Monday, Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone - their third phone call in four days.",
      "But we do not know whether Trump gave Starmer prior warning of his decision on military aid or not.",
      "It may be that Starmer tried to persuade Trump not to go ahead and failed. Or it may be that Trump did not tell Starmer what he was about to do.",
      "Neither of those scenarios would be especially positive for the prime minister.",
      "Vance comments row",
      "As it is, it seems Downing Street is still waiting on full details of the US administration's decision and how it will work.",
      "And it is worth stressing that this is a temporary pause in aid, not a permanent cessation. It may simply be another attempt by Trump to pressure Zelensky. The aid may resume.",
      "Or, this may be the clearest example that  - despite the unquestionable warmth Starmer has managed to foster with the US president - the fundamental frames through which they view this conflict and the western alliance more generally are irreconcilably different.",
      "Into this increasingly fraught transatlantic environment has come JD Vance, the US vice-president, scoffing at the idea Ukraine could be protected by \"20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years\".",
      "So far only the UK and France have publicly committed troops towards policing any potential peace deal in Ukraine, and his comments were interpreted by many as having been a jibe at both countries.",
      "Vance has now insisted he was talking about other, unnamed countries - confining the diplomatic fallout for the time being.",
      "Yet even if Vance was referring to other countries which might be willing to take on some of the military burden of protecting Ukraine, it is hardly encouraging for the UK in its convening role in Europe if the response of the US vice-president is to mock their capabilities.",
      "Perhaps that is merely a more blunt-speaking approach from a new US administration determined to do away with niceties.",
      "After all, most European countries are now admitting themselves that their defence spending has been far too low for far too long.",
      "But all the signs suggest that before long, questions about Sir Keir Starmer's approach to Ukraine may give way to much more fundamental questions about Britain's place in a profoundly changed world."

      "It came in the form of a question - was it all worth it? Was this gathering of European powers enough to shift the diplomatic dial? Or had the United States made up its mind to go it alone on finding a ceasefire in Ukraine?",
      "The prime minister's answer was very much that Europe still had a role to play. He said the UK, France and others would work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting and then discuss that plan with the US.",
      "He said Europe would keep military aid flowing now and, in the event of a peace deal, it would boost Ukraine's own defensive capabilities, building up the country's \"armed forces and border defences\" to ensure that \"Ukraine can draw on munitions, finance and equipment to defend itself,\" according to the official conclusions of the summit.",
      "And Sir Keir said there would be a \"coalition of the willing\" to defend Ukraine and guarantee peace.",
      "Who or what that would involve is not yet clear. The prime minister merely said that there would be \"a force consisting of European and other partners\".",
      "The UK and France have already said they would be willing to put boots on the ground in Ukraine to help deter Russian aggression.",
      "The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, said the purpose was to turn Ukraine into a \"steel porcupine that is indigestible for potential invaders\".",
      "The aim, it would appear, is to beef up the European offer for post-war security guarantees for Ukraine in an attempt to convince Donald Trump to promise a US military backstop.",
      "The president has thus far been reluctant to go down that route, suggesting the presence of US mining firms on the ground in Ukraine would be enough to keep the peace.",
      "Sir Keir does not share this view, saying explicitly \"to support peace on our continent and to succeed, this effort must have strong US backing\".",
      "This summit was in many ways an attempt by Europe to take some ownership of the diplomacy. In recent weeks, efforts to end fighting in Ukraine have been led by Trump speaking to Russian's President Vladimir Putin and at his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky.",

    "story": [
      "The US-UK trade deal warmly suggested by President Donald Trump should help insulate the UK from the direct impact of global trade tensions.",
      "It signals that the White House has accepted the statistical logic that the US and UK have a balanced trade position.",
      "Essentially each country roughly exports the same amount of goods to one another. Indeed, rather helpfully, according to the US numbers it exports more.",
      "There is no general case that the UK is, in the words and logic of the president,  \"ripping off\" or \"screwing\" the US, as he has suggested of many other countries and the EU.",
      "So a deal to avoid the further trade barriers is very much on the cards.",
      "But this is not the wideranging US-UK free trade agreement to lower almost all existing tariffs, that was the subject of so much debate in the Brexit era.",
      "It is important to remember that the wider deal was never properly prioritised by Trump's own team, because, as they told me, they never truly believed that the UK would find it in its interest to make the necessary hard break from the EU.",
      "It is difficult to see that the UK government would want to further aggravate farmers, or its own base, by putting US farm imports or NHS pricing on the table.",
      "In addition, on goods trade, the government is already prioritising its \"Brexit reset\" - a food standards deal, and some customs arrangements to bring down newish trade barriers with the European Union. Tellingly, the top official on that negotiation was in the Oval Office.",
      "UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump",
      "Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump",
      "How could Trump's tariffs affect the UK?",
      "The narrower \"economic deal\", as it was termed by Sir Keir Starmer, centres around technology and what the UK has referred to as the \"further integration of our two countries' tech sectors\".",
      "Perhaps the best analogy is that the tech expertise held within the London-Oxford-Cambridge triangle could become for a booming AI-driven Silicon Valley what London's financial City became to New York's Wall Street. The fact that Vice President and big tech ally JD Vance will be leading some of the US negotiation is key here.",
      "This strategy will have consequences. Trump's team are already railing against digital services taxes.",
      "The UK's digital services tax was introduced in 2020 and imposes a 2% charge on revenues made by big tech firms running social media, internet search engines or online marketplaces.",
      "While the \u00a3700m-\u00a31bn a year it raises in the UK is smallish beer, since the UK and France introduced a hit to big tech's revenues, many other countries have followed suit.",
      "The White House wants to \"stop the contagion\", and that could mean persuading the UK to lower or abolish it. Chancellor Rachel Reeves advocated raising it from 2% to 12% just four years ago.",
      "Likewise the vice president in the Oval Office mentioned US tech firms being unfairly affected by what he called \"freedom of speech\" issues.",
      "This appears to be a reference to the Online Safety Act. This aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material, although some have argued it risks stifling free expression online. My understanding is that, right now, movement may be less likely here.",
      "The prize will be integration into the massive investments from the best capitalised tech companies in the world.",
      "Could the UK start to attract back some of the investments lost to Dublin, for example? Would the EU stand back and allow the UK to develop as an offshore hub for US tech companies to service the whole of Europe?",
      "There are two other significant issues. It is not unknown for warm words in the Oval Office to be somewhat contradicted by actions soon after. While sat next to the PM, President Trump described the EU's levying of VAT as a trade restriction, seemingly unaware that the UK does exactly the same thing.",
      "And even if it avoids direct new tariffs from President Trump, the open UK economy would be affected by any wide-ranging trade war involving most of the G7 and other countries.",
      "That is still on the cards. Not only would that collapse world growth and potentially spike up inflation again, but could upend entirely the workings of the World Trade Organization.",
      "The PM says the UK doesn't have to choose between the US and other allies, but it may appear like that to them.",
      "The strategy appears to be to become the Switzerland of global economics. Neutrality in a world of trade turmoil, not so much sat on a fence, but tiptoeing along a rather wobbly one."

    "story": [
      "A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.",
      "A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, \"Where you from, ma'am?\"",
      "\"England.\"",
      "\"Hope you enjoy Estelle,\" he says.",
      "\"Do you?\" I ask.",
      "\"A lot better than where I was before.\"",
      "Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.",
      "Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.",
      "The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.",
      "Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.",
      "Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.",
      "No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.",
      "Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.",
      "He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.",
      "\"I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,\" he says. \"If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.\"",
      "Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.",
      "The \"good time credit\" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.",
      "Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.",
      "Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.",
      "\"They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,\" he says. \"I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.\"",
      "The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).",
      "The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.",
      "\"The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,\" Ms Mahmood says. \"They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.\"",
      "She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. \"It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.\"",
      "The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.",
      "\"The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,\" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. \"And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.\"",
      "What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: \"To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.\"",
      "As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of \"diversion programmes\" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.",

      "More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.",
      "Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.",
      "\"I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,\" Ms Mahmood says.",
      "It's a plan with \"huge potential in the UK\" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.",
      "\"It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,\" he says.",

      "\"Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,\" she says. \"It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.\"",
      "It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding \u2013 and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 09:40:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthews, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthews agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "Its main role is to chop up old proteins into smaller chunks so they can be recycled to make new ones.",
      "But a series of experiments, detailed in the journal Nature, shows the proteasome detects when a cell has been infected by bacteria.",

      "More than a million people a year are estimated to die from infections that are resistant to drugs like antibiotics.",
      "Drug-resistant infections killing millions - study",
      "But despite the need, there has been a lack of research into developing new antibiotics to keep up with demand.",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",

      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds.

    "story": [
      "The world's largest iceberg has run aground in shallow waters off the remote British island of South Georgia, home to millions of penguins and seals.",
      "The iceberg, which is about twice the size of Greater London, appears to be stuck and should start breaking up on the island's south-west shores.",
      "Fishermen fear they will be forced to battle with vast chunks of ice, and it could affect some macaroni penguins feeding in the area.",
      "But scientists in Antarctica say that huge amounts of nutrients are locked inside the ice, and that as it melts, it could create an explosion of life in the ocean.",
      "\"It's like dropping a nutrient bomb into the middle of an empty desert,\" says Prof Nadine Johnston from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "Ecologist Mark Belchier who advises the South Georgia government said: \"If it breaks up, the resulting icebergs are likely to present a hazard to vessels as they move in the local currents and could restrict vessels' access to local fishing grounds.\"",
      "The stranding is the latest twist in an almost 40-year story that began when the mega chunk of ice broke off the Filchner\u2013Ronne Ice Shelf in 1986.",
      "We have tracked its route on satellite pictures since December when it finally broke free after being trapped in an ocean vortex.",
      "As it moved north through warmer waters nicknamed iceberg alley, it remained remarkably intact. For a few days, it even appeared to spin on the spot, before speeding up in mid-February travelling at about 20 miles (30km) a day.",
      "\"The future of all icebergs is that they will die. It's very surprising to see that A23a has lasted this long and only lost about a quarter of its area,\" said Prof Huw Griffiths, speaking to BBC News from the Sir David Attenborough polar research ship currently in Antarctica.",
      "On Saturday the 300m tall ice colossus struck the shallow continental shelf about 50 miles (80km) from land and now appears to be firmly lodged.",
      "\"It's probably going to stay more or less where it is, until chunks break off,\" says Prof Andrew Meijers from British Antarctic Survey.",
      "It is showing advancing signs of decay. Once 3,900 sq km (1,500 sq miles) in size, it has been steadily shrinking, shedding huge amounts of water as it moves into warmer seas. It is now an estimated 3,234 sq km.",
      "\"Instead of a big, sheer pristine box of ice, you can see caverns under the edges,\" Prof Meijers says.",
      "Tides will now be lifting it up and down, and where it is touching the continental shelf, it will grind backwards and forwards, eroding the rock and ice.",
      "\"If the ice underneath is rotten - eroded by salt - it'll crumble away under stress and maybe drift somewhere more shallow,\" says Prof Meijers.",
      "But where the ice is touching the shelf, there are thousands of tiny creatures like coral, sea slugs and sponge.",
      "\"Their entire universe is being bulldozed by a massive slab of ice scraping along the sea floor,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "That is catastrophic in the short-term for these species, but he says that it is a natural part of the life cycle in the region.",
      "\"Where it is destroying something in one place, it's providing nutrients and food in other places,\" he adds.",
      "There had been fears for the islands' larger creatures. In 2004 an iceberg in a different area called the Ross Sea affected the breeding success of penguins, leading to a spike in deaths.",
      "But experts now think that most of South Georgia's birds and animals will escape that fate.",
      "Some Macaroni penguins that forage on the shelf where the iceberg is stuck could be affected, says Peter Fretwell at the British Antarctic Survey.",
      "The iceberg melts freshwater into salt water, reducing the amount of food including krill (a small crustacean) that penguins eat.",
      "The birds could move to other feeding grounds, he explains, but that would put them in competition with other creatures.",
      "The ice could block harbours or disrupt sailing when the fishing season starts in April.",
      "\"This will be the most ice from an iceberg we will have ever dealt with in a fishing season, but we are well-prepared and resourced,\" says Andrew Newman from Argos Froyanes.",
      "But scientists working in Antarctica currently are also discovering the incredible contributions that icebergs make to ocean life.",
      "Prof Griffiths and Prof Johnston are working on the Sir David Attenborough ship collecting evidence of what their team believe is a huge flow of nutrients from ice in Antarctica across Earth.",

      "How mega icebergs change the ocean",
      "\"Without ice, we wouldn't have these ecosystems. They are some of the most productive in the world, and support huge numbers of species and individual animals, and feed the biggest animals in the world like the blue whale,\" says Prof Griffiths.",
      "A sign that this nutrient release has started around A23a will be when vast phytoplankton blooms blossom around the iceberg. It would look like a vast green halo around the ice, visible from satellite pictures over the next weeks and months.",
      "The life cycle of icebergs is a natural process, but climate change is expected to create more icebergs as Antarctica warms and becomes more unstable.",

      "Over the last nine months, many scientists have raised concerns about the controversial billionaire's behaviour, which has been called a \"threat to science\".",
      "A meeting on Monday evening did not result in Mr Musk's expulsion, but it has drawn the world's oldest scientific academy into a divisive, political row.",

      "Two eminent scientists have resigned their fellowships in protest - Dr Dorothy Bishop of Oxford University and Prof Andrew Millar from University of Edinburgh.",
      "More than than 3,300 scientists also put their names to a letter, written by Prof Stephen Curry, emeritus professor of structural biology at Imperial College London, who is not a fellow, that expressed \"deep concern\" about the billionaire's fellowship and the society's \"continued silence and apparent inaction\" with regard to the controversy.",
      "Prof Curry told the BBC he was glad that the society had gathered fellows to discuss these concerns.",
      "But, he added that he was \"disappointed that they have so far given only a very short statement summarising the meeting\".",
      "\"It makes no mention of the one [member] whose actions contrary to their code of conduct have prompted it\".",
      "Dr Dorothy Bishop, emeritus professor of development neuropsychology at Oxford University and the first fellow to resign over the issue, told BBC News she had complained to the Royal Society twice last year.",
      "\"On both occasions they consulted lawyers, and it may well be the case that the lawyers are concerned about the prospect of legal action,\" she said.",
      "There are more than 1,700 fellows of the Royal Society and more than 60 of them have signed Prof Curry's letter. Many more have expressed their concern about Mr Musk's behaviour.",

      "Other scientists who spoke to the BBC pointed out that an attempt to remove Mr Musk's fellowship could be seen as political interference and a curtailment of freedom of expression.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 00:39:34 GMT",
    "summary": "How a new atomic clock might be the way to tackle attacks on plane GPS systems",
    "story": [
      "As a Ryanair flight from London approached Vilnius, Lithuania, on 17 January, its descent was suddenly aborted. Just minutes from touching down, the aircraft's essential Global Positioning System (GPS) suffered an unexplained interference, triggering an emergency diversion.",
      "The Boeing 737 MAX 8-200 had already descended to around 850ft (259m) when the disruption occurred. Instead of landing, the plane was forced to climb back into the sky and divert nearly 400km (250 miles) south to Warsaw, Poland. Lithuanian air authorities later confirmed the aircraft had been affected by \"GPS signal interference\".",
      "This was not an isolated incident. Over the last three months of 2024, more than 800 cases of GPS interference were recorded in Lithuanian airspace. Estonia and Finland have also raised concerns, accusing Russia of deploying technology to jam satellite navigation signals near Nato's eastern flank \u2013 though the country has denied that. Last March the then Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, was on a plane that had its GPS signal jammed while flying close to Russian territory.",
      "The threat of GPS jamming extends beyond aviation. Without GPS, our lives would grind to a halt: in 2017, a government report stated that systematic GPS jamming could bring the UK's financial, electricity and communications systems to a standstill.",
      "To pinpoint our exact location, we need to know the exact time. GPS works by users receiving signals from multiple satellites. The length of time it takes each signal to reach a device is used to determine exactly where on Earth we are.",
      "Very large atomic clocks communicate directly with the satellites, allowing them to know the time to within 100 billionths of a second, and this precision timing is key to a variety of economic activities around the world, including communication systems, electrical power grids, and financial networks.",
      "The potential cost of losing GPS has been put at \u00a31.4bn each day \u2013 no wonder GPS jamming is on the government's national risk register as one of the UK's greatest threats.",
      "With this in mind, a group of British scientists \u2013 dubbed the \"Time Lords\" \u2013 has been asked to come up with a solution.",
      "The plan is simple: to develop a more secure alternative to GPS by enabling the portable use of new atomic clocks, rather than relying on signals from satellites in space that can be jammed. But its execution is fiendishly difficult: to harness the power of the atom, develop a new type of clock, and even change the way we measure time itself \u2013 all within a few years.",
      "In recent months, the UK government has set up research initiatives to tackle the threat of GPS jamming. But turning prototypes into robust devices that could one day be incorporated into our phones is an enormous undertaking \u2013 and the need for the new technology is getting ever more urgent.",
      "A new way of measuring time",
      "The challenge can be compared to the invention of a portable clock for marine navigation by John Harrison in the 18th Century, which solved the so-called longitude problem, allowing a new era of trade and a golden age of exploration.",
      "Three hundred years on, researchers are once again racing to perfect a new clock to solve the GPS problem \u2013 and the impact could be at least as transformative.",
      "\"History shows that each time we have an improvement in the ability to measure time, new applications follow to make things possible that people didn't dream of before,\" says Dr Helen Margolis, head scientist (time and frequency) of the UK's timing laboratories at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in south-west London.",
      "In 1967, the world's timekeepers, an intergovernmental body called the General Conference on Weights and Measures, agreed to define time using atomic clocks, rather than by the Earth's rotation.",
      "The switch transformed our world just as radically as Harrison's clock, laying the foundation for GPS and similar space-based systems. These provided precise timekeeping from atomic clocks on satellites, which allowed rapid and huge volumes of communications, computation, and transactions to be carried out everywhere in the world near instantaneously, as well as more precise navigation.",
      "The search for a new portable alternative to GPS involves a field called quantum technologies, finding ways to manipulate atoms. Much of the buzz around the subject in recent years has been about the development of powerful quantum computers which, the narrative goes, will make our fastest supercomputers seem like abacuses by comparison.",
      "But a quieter revolution to improve navigation and measurement of time has flown under the radar, and it is in this field that quantum technology is set to make its earliest impact, according to Prof Douglas Paul of the UK Hub for Quantum Enabled Position Navigation and Timing (QEPNT), which was set up last December by the government to develop these new devices.",
      "\"We are expecting to see some sort of navigation system within two to five years in the marketplace,\" he says. \"So, some of these technologies are already quite advanced.\"",
      "The 'Time Lords'",
      "Prof Paul and his quantum scientists are working with Dr Margolis and her fellow researchers at NPL, who have been given the \"Time Lords\" nickname by other horologists. In 1955, the NPL invented the first atomic clock of the sort that is used today, based on the frequency of radiation from an atom of the element caesium.",
      "GPS and other satellite navigation systems reset their own clocks by touching base with these more accurate clocks on the ground. For the alternative to GPS, the scientists will need a new type of atomic clock that can eventually be miniaturised and robust enough to work in everyday situations, rather than the carefully controlled conditions inside a lab.",
      "The NPL researchers are perfecting a so-called optical clock to achieve this, which is 100 times more accurate than the most accurate caesium clocks used today. It looks as if it might be part of Dr Who's Tardis and is stimulated with laser light rather than microwaves.",
      "When optical clocks take over from caesium ones as the timepieces that determine Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), the way the passage of time is defined will also have to change, according to Dr Margolis.",
      "\"The international community has drawn up a road map for the redefinition of the second,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "The NPL's immediate hope is to have a national network by 2030, connecting four atomic clocks across the UK that businesses can plug into for secure accurate timekeeping and for developing new innovative applications that harness ultra-fast time.",
      "Eventually, critical systems in the UK in finance, telecommunications, energy, utilities and national security could switch over \u2013 though that would take longer. \"To convert everything is at least a decade away, and probably significantly longer,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Yet the stakes are high, and the alternative this new technology offers is significant. \"The US Department of Defence might decide to stop supporting GPS, it could be taken out in a conflict or by an accident,\" he says. \"There is no guarantee GPS \u2026 will always be available. With all the jamming and spoofing [where a criminal gives a false signal with an incorrect time and location], you cannot always guarantee you have an assured signal, so if you cannot get or trust the information then people will stop using it.\"",
      "While this type of research is taking place around the world, it's being led by the UK. When an aircraft with the technology on board carried out a test flight in May 2024, the then science minister Andrew Griffith described it as \"further proof of the UK as one of the world leaders on quantum\". According to the government, it was the first test of this type of technology in the UK on an aircraft in flight, and \"the first such flight worldwide that has been publicly acknowledged\".",
      "By carrying a group of atoms cooled to -273C on the plane itself, rather than relying on an external signal, the technology can't be interfered with by jamming.",
      "But the problem is that the equipment is still too large to be used routinely on planes.",
      "Henry White, part of the team from BAE Systems that worked on the test flight, told BBC News that he thought the first application could be aboard ships, \"where there's a bit more space\".",
      "Quantum clocks, gyroscopes and accelerometers are large, bulky and incredibly expensive, with an accurate quantum clock costing around \u00a3100,000. Yet military research is allowing the creation of smaller, better and cheaper systems.",
      "GPS jamming is causing problems for the British military in conflict zones such as Ukraine. One of the main challenges faced by scientists at the government's Defence, Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) is making the sensitive technology work not just in the real world, which in the Navy's case is often in very choppy seas, but also in the harshest of environments; the battlefield, according to a lead researcher at the DSTL, who has to remain anonymous for security reasons.",
      "\"We are harnessing atoms,\" she points out.",
      "\"You have vibrations, you have pressure changes, you have temperature changes, and you have environments which have all of these different variables going on while you are trying to manipulate the properties of light. So, it's precision that is needed\".",
      "Atomic clocks in our pockets",
      "The ultimate aim for some of those working on this new technology is for each of us to have the equivalent of our own personal GPS system incorporated into our phones.",
      "This would comprise a miniaturised optical clock as well as a tiny gyroscope, so we know which direction we are going in, and a device called an accelerometer, which will tell us how fast we are going.",
      "QEPNT has been set up by the government to shrink the devices on to a chip, making them robust enough for everyday life and affordable for everyone.",
      "That process isn't going to happen soon, though. \"This is many decades away from happening for all critical national infrastructure across the UK,\" says Prof Paul.",
      "Quantum clock researchers are facing exactly the same problems experienced by John Harrison when he was developing his portable marine clock in the 18th Century. Mr Harrison had to build a clock whose timekeeping was not affected by changes in temperature, pressure or humidity, and was able to function in a constantly moving ship \u2013 his greatest difficulty was to make it small.",

      "Three years on, Ukraine's extinction nightmare has returned",
      "Race policies or Israel - what's really driving Trump's fury with South Africa?",
      "But it turned out that his difficulty was also the path to his solution. The smaller he made his clocks, the more robust he found they were at sea.",
      "\"Harrison found that it was it easier to isolate them from all those external influences,\" says another DSTL scientist.",
      "\"As was the case 300 years ago, as we make these systems smaller, it will become easier to control the environment around them and isolate them from the effects of vibration, temperature, pressure, and humidity.\"",
      "Prominent 18th-Century scientists, including Sir Isaac Newton, thought that navigation with marine clocks was impossible. But eventually Mr Harrison, a simple clockmaker and carpenter, proved his more illustrious colleagues wrong.",
      "Bringing prototype optical clocks first into the battlefield and then eventually into everyday life is just as challenging. Will the scientists working on the problem be able to find solutions fast enough?",
      "One day we might have them in our pockets, but the more urgent aim is to get them in a state where we can safely fly, as incidents of GPS jamming on planes and critical computer systems increase. The Time Lords and quantum scientists hope to continue the humble clockmaker's legacy \u2013 transforming the measurement of time, and protecting the UK's critical systems from GPS attack.",

      "Hunted to extinction in Britain four hundred years ago, beavers have in the last two decades been making a comeback.",
      "But some farmers are concerned that without proper management the large rodents could have negative impacts on food production.",
      "It's thought that about five hundred beavers already live in England, some in the wild and others in enclosures. Many more are in Scotland, where wild releases are already permitted.",
      "Conservationists call beavers \"ecosystem engineers\" because of how they redesign where they live. The dams they build slow the flow of rivers and streams and create habitats where other creatures can thrive. They've also been credited with reducing flooding further downstream.",
      "\"This is an incredibly exciting moment, a real landmark for nature recovery in England,\" Tony Juniper, the head of Natural England, told me next to a beaver dam in Devon.",
      "\"We're bringing back a missing animal that's been absent for centuries, and an animal that we know will bring huge benefits for the rest of the wildlife that is already depleted across much of England,\" he says.",
      "The beavers will be released under a licensing system overseen by Natural England.",
      "It says long term plans will need to be in place to avoid impacts on farming, food production and infrastructure.",
      "That's something the National Farmers Union say is vital. It wants culling beavers  to be an option if they prove disruptive.",
      "NFU Deputy President David Exwood said that while beavers could provide certain benefits, \"we are concerned about the negative impacts beavers can have on productive farmland, as well as the management requirements, costs and risks involved\".",
      "\"Beavers can flood and waterlog fields, feed on agricultural crops like maize, as well as damage and fell trees such as cricket bat willow.\"",
      "We met up with Tony Juniper of Natural England at the site of the pilot project for wild beaver release in England, the River Otter catchment in Devon. Beavers first appeared here more than a decade ago - it's not clear where they came from. They may have escaped from enclosures or have been illegally released, so called \"beaver bombing\".",
      "Since then the wild beavers have been allowed to stay, with their impact on the landscape and the way they interact with local farmland closely monitored.",
      "\"All of this open water is down to the beavers,\" Peter Burgess of the Devon Wildlife Trust tells me as we splash our way through the boggy land.",
      "\"They want this water because it makes them feel safe and secure. It means that they can transport their food as well.\"",
      "Along the River Otter Mr Burgess tells me the beavers have created wetlands that now host species such as great white egrets and kingfishers. Dragonfly numbers have soared as have frogs and toads. Water voles now roam the network of channels, streams, and ponds the beavers use to navigate the flood plain.",
      "Not everyone in the area is delighted by the thought of beaver dams popping up everywhere.",
      "Clinton Devon Estates manage several farms in the Devon catchment area where the trial wild beaver project has been running. Though broadly supportive of the beavers' return there are concerns about whether enough thought has been given to managing their impacts.",
      "\"We've also seen farmland flooded, we've seen properties flooded. We've seen people's trees in their gardens felled,\" says John Varley, the chief executive of Clinton Devon Estates.",
      "\"There are positives with the beaver, huge positives, but there's also some quite significant negatives, particularly for small farmers.\"",
      "Scotland is several years ahead of England and has already approved the release of beavers and it's thought there are now more than 1,500 living wild. In some areas the beavers have been so successful at breeding that they have had to be relocated or as a last resort culled.",
      "The first wild release of beavers in England is now expected to take place in the next few days. Dr Roisin Campbell-Palmer from the Beaver Trust, which is managing the release, told the BBC the male and female had been taken from \"conflict sites\" in Scotland and were now undergoing medical checks ahead of being moved south.",

    "summary": "Government-backed heat pump installations in the UK reached record levels for 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The number of UK homes installing heat pumps supported by government-funded incentives rose to a record level last year.",
      "Figures released on Thursday showed 52% more of the low-carbon heating systems were installed than in 2023.",
      "Experts said part of the rise was due to an increase in the grant offered by the government's Boiler Upgrade Scheme (BUS) to persuade people to switch from gas boilers.",
      "But the heat pump industry warned that running costs needed to fall for the government to hit its targets to install hundreds of thousands of the devices each year as part of its Net Zero plan to tackle climate change.",
      "A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero spokesperson said: \"The energy shocks of recent years have shown the urgent need to upgrade British homes and help more people benefit from homegrown energy.",
      "\"That's why we have almost doubled the budget for the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to \u00a3295 million for the next financial year, and just launched a new campaign to help make more families aware of our offer of a \u00a37,500 heat pump grant.\"",
      "What is a heat pump and how much do they cost?",
      "Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told",
      "Most UK homes use gas boilers to meet their heating needs but gas is a fossil fuel that when burnt produces planet-warming gases.",
      "With home heating accounting for 14% of the UK's carbon emissions, switching households from gas boilers to heat pumps is a key part of the government's climate pledges.",
      "Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, so as the country moves to generating electricity from renewable energy sources, like solar and wind, heat pumps will be responsible for far fewer planet-warming emissions than boilers.",
      "About half of heat pumps currently being installed in the UK are supported by government funding - the remainder are made up of commercial installations and new builds which do not receive support.",
      "One of the most popular government support mechanisms is the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which provides a \u00a37,500 grant to households to offset the cost of installation.",
      "Ed Matthews, UK programme director for think tank E3G, said the decision by the previous government to increase the grant by 50% has had the biggest impact on the installation figures.",
      "\"It has been absolutely critical for making it affordable for households to buy this technology,\" he said.",
      "In its first year, the scheme only spent a third of the funding allocated due to low public interest. But for 2024-2025 it is expected to overspend its budget.",
      "Mr Matthews said it was critical that in the government's June spending review recommits to the programme and provides greater funding for low-income households as the current costs - even with the grant - can be prohibitive.",
      "\"They do not want to take their foot off the brake here. If they suddenly start slashing the heat pump grant that's going to make the market crash,\" he said.",
      "He also \"strongly welcomed\" the government's announcement on Thursday that it was launching a new communication campaign to build public understanding of heat pumps, which he hoped would combat misinformation about the technology.",
      "Despite the progress, the total number of heat pump sales, including those not supported by government programmes, was just shy of 100,000 last year, according to the Heat Pump Association (HPA). This is significantly below the government's target of 600,000 a year by 2028.",
      "But Charlotte Lee, chief executive of the HPA, remained positive because of future planning policy changes expected later this year.",
      "\"The future homes and building standards will see the market move. 200,000 homes are potentially being built every year, [and] the vast majority of those will be required to have a heat pump - it will absolutely create a gear change in the market,\" she said.",
      "Madeleine Gabriel, head of sustainable mission at charity Nesta, agreed that changes to planning rules could also help to address the regional disparities in installation.",
      "\"The key thing is removing a rule that meant that you could only install a heat pump if you were more than one metre away from your property boundary, which made it difficult if you've got a small garden,\" she said.",
      "This explains why dense urban areas, like London, has some of the lowest installation rates as a large share of people live in flats, she added.",
      "Ms Gabriel and Mr Matthews agreed with the UK government's independent climate advisors, the UK Climate Change Committee (UKCCC), that the biggest barrier is the high price of electricity.",
      "In a major report published last month, the UKCCC said that the cost of electricity could be brought down if the levies applied to electricity bills, to fund the cost of social and environment schemes, were removed or placed on gas bills.",
      "\"Once the consumer can save money [with heat pumps], I think it really changes the level of interest. We're moving from early adopters that think it's the right thing to do to, actually, this is just a sensible financial investment choice,\" Ms Lee said.",

      "Criticism has flooded in, including that engineering mammoth-like creatures is a big stretch from making mice hairier, as well as being unethical, and that the whole project is a publicity stunt.",
      "But the company says it has been misjudged and that the mouse is an important tool on the path to restoring Earth's depleted nature.",
      "Colossal Biosciences says that the experiments with hairy mice was a step towards genetically modifying elephants to be hairy and better able to withstand the cold.",
      "Its stated goal is to create herds of what it calls mammoth-like creatures to live in the arctic tundra. The company says the creatures' grazing habits would encourage grasslands to flourish and reduce the amount of carbon dioxide being released from melting permafrost.",
      "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas which is one of the main drivers of global warming.",
      "But critics say there are significant scientific challenges to overcome before these changes in mice can be tried out on elephants.",
      "Colossal's co-founder and CEO, Ben Lam, told BBC News that the woolly mice marked a big step forward.",

      "In response, the Colossal researchers say they feel misjudged. Their mouse is a tool, they say, with which to test whether different genetic alterations they have planned are effective and safe before they try them out on elephants.",
      "\"Validation that this works is really exciting for this project,\" says the firm's chief science officer, Prof Beth Shapiro.",
      "She adds that the firm has other research programmes running in parallel, such as studying embryo development and creating artificial wombs for the genetically modified elephants to grow in, and which the company says will ensure that they achieve their target of creating cold adapted elephants in a few years.",
      "Prof Shapiro firmly disputes the allegation that the work is pointless. She says that the firm's plan to reintroduce extinct species, such as the Dodo and Tasmanian Tiger, as well as the mammoth, will fill ecological niches that have been lost, and so restore biodiversity and benefit the environment.",
      "The genetic tools it is developing in the meantime are already helping species at risk of extinction, she adds. These include developing a vaccine for elephants against a deadly virus; the creation of genetically modified marsupials in Australia known as quoll to be resistant to neurotoxins produced by the cane toad; and reintroducing genetic diversity in the pink pigeon in Mauritius.",
      "And Prof Shapiro says that elephants won't suffer. The team is developing techniques to screen only viable embryos, and she believes that they won't be treated as outcasts either.",
      "\"We really are only going to be changing a few letters in their DNA code. The elephants will be born to mothers who are not going to see them as freaks because they are going to be very much the same as them, just a lot more hair and can survive colder climates\".",

    "summary": "Ireland is investing billions of euros to revamp its healthcare service - will AI help?",
    "story": [
      "For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology.",
      "They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics.",
      "In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E.",
      "Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online.",
      "But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare.",
      "That includes a programme called Sl\u00e1intecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its \u20ac22.9bn (\u00a320bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's.",
      "To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved.",
      "It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department.",
      "That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen.",
      "\"In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,\" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater.",
      "Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment.",
      "To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: \"We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures.\"",
      "The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to.",
      "\"Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,\" he says.",
      "Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges.",
      "Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends.",
      "Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin.",
      "But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a \"synthetic MRI\" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries.",
      "That was done by feeding a \"generative AI\" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person.",
      "Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments.",
      "And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends.",
      "Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008.",
      "But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally.",
      "That will \"severely delay\" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon.",
      "Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge.",
      "\"Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,\" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin.",
      "\"Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,\" he says.",
      "Using AI in healthcare is not without problems.",
      "An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing.",
      "But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication.",
      "To prevent such AI from hallucinating, \"you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,\" says Prof MacMahon.",
      "AIs can have biases, but \"humans have biases too\", he points out.",
      "A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot.",
      "\"For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error\", than in new health technology where \"the acceptable risk is zero\", says Prof Se\u00e1n Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "This means we \"continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans\", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says.",
      "Healthcare regulators, who already have a \"weak enough\" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University.",
      "For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured.",
      "But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. \"For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,\" he points out.",
      "AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them.",
      "That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin.",

    "story": [
      "New Zealand has fired its most senior envoy to the United Kingdom over remarks that questioned US President Donald Trump's grasp of history.",
      "At an event in London on Tuesday, High Commissioner Phil Goff compared efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine to the 1938 Munich Agreement, which allowed Adolf Hitler to annex part of Czechoslovakia.",
      "Mr Goff recalled how Sir Winston Churchill had criticised the agreement, then said of the US leader: \"President Trump has restored the bust of Churchill to the Oval Office. But do you think he really understands history?\"",
      "His comments were \"deeply disappointing\" and made his position \"untenable\", New Zealand's Foreign Minister Winston Peters said.",
      "His comments came after Trump paused military aid to Kyiv following a heated exchange with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office last week.",
      "He contrasted Trump with Churchill who, while estranged from the British government, spoke against the Munich Agreement as he saw it as a surrender to Nazi Germany's threats.",
      "Mr Goff quoted how Churchill had rebuked then UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain: \"You had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, yet you will have war.\"",
      "Peters said Mr Goff's views did not represent those of the New Zealand government.",
      "\"When you are in that position you represent the government and the policies of the day, you're not able to free think, you are the face of New Zealand,\" local media reported Peters saying.",
      "\"It's not the way you behave as the front face of a country, diplomatically,\" he said, adding that he would have taken the same course of action no matter which country was being spoken about.",
      "Mr Goff is a veteran politician who had been high commissioner since January 2023. Before that, he served for two terms as mayor of Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, and was leader of the Labour Party from 2008 to 2011. He had also held several ministerial portfolios, including justice, foreign affairs and defence.",
      "Peters, who is also deputy prime minister, told reporters that he had made the decision to sack Phil Goff without first consulting Prime Minister Christopher Luxon.",
      "When it was pointed out that Luxon was the leader of New Zealand, Peters responded: \"I know he's the prime minister, I made him the prime minister.\"",
      "The 79-year-old, who has previously worked with Mr Goff in government, leads the New Zealand First political party - which joined Luxon's National Party and the Act Party in 2023 to form the current ruling centre-right coalition government.",
      "Luxon, for his part, said Peters' decision to fire Mr Goff without first consulting him was \"entirely appropriate\".",
      "Former Prime Minister Helen Clark was among those who criticised Mr Goff's sacking, saying it was backed by a \"very thin excuse\".",

      "In December, he nominated former World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) CEO and his transition co-chair, Linda McMahon, as his pick for education secretary. The Senate has yet to schedule confirmation proceedings for McMahon.",
      "What does the Department of Education do?",
      "A common misconception is that the Department of Education operates US schools and sets curricula - that responsibility actually belongs to states and local districts.",
      "The agency does oversee student loan programmes and administers Pell grants that help low-income students attend university.",

    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 22:47:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The \"Made in China\" juggernaut was built over decades. Can Trump's moves set it back?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has hit China with a second tariff in as many months, which means imports from there now face a levy of at least 20%.",
      "This is his latest salvo against Beijing, which already faces steep US tariffs, from 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles to 15% on clothes and shoes.",
      "Trump's tariffs strike at the heart of China's manufacturing juggernaut - a web of factories, assembly lines and supply chains that manufacture and ship just about everything, from fast fashion and toys to solar panels and electric cars.",
      "China's trade surplus with the world rose to a record $1tn (\u00a3788bn) in 2024, on the back of strong exports ($3.5tn), which surpassed its import bill ($2.5tn).",
      "It has long been the world's factory - it has thrived because of cheap labour and state investment in infrastructure ever since it opened its economy to global business in the late 1970s.",
      "So how badly could Trump's trade war hurt China's manufacturing success?",
      "What are tariffs and how do they work?",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",
      "Most tariffs are set as a percentage of the value of the goods, and it's generally the importer who pays them.",
      "So, a 10% tariff means a product imported to the US from China worth $4 would face an additional $0.40 charge applied to it.",
      "Increasing the price of imported goods is meant to encourage consumers to buy cheaper domestic products instead, thus helping to boost their own economy's growth.",
      "Trump sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue. But economic studies of the impact of tariffs which Trump imposed during his first term in office, suggest the measures ultimately raised prices for US consumers.",
      "Trump has said his most recent tariffs are aimed at pressuring China to do more to stop the flow of the opioid fentanyl to the US.",
      "He also imposed 25% tariffs on America's neighbours Mexico and Canada, saying its leaders were not doing enough to crack down on the cross-border illegal drug trade.",
      "China retaliates against US tariffs - but it also wants to talk",
      "Three reasons Trump tariffs aren't China's only problem",
      "Can Trump's tariffs hurt China's factories?",
      "Yes, analysts say.",
      "Exports have been the \"saving grace\" of China's economy and if the taxes linger,  exports to the US could drop by a quarter to a third, Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's analytics, told the BBC.",
      "The sheer value of China's exports - which account for a fifth of the country's earnings - means that a 20% tariff could weaken demand from overseas and shrink the trade surplus.",
      "\"The tariffs will hurt China,\" Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong, told the BBC. \"They really need to do much more. They need to do what Xi Jinping has already said - boost domestic demand.\"",
      "That is a tall task in an economy where the property market is slumping and disillusioned youth are struggling to find high-paying jobs.",
      "Chinese people have not been spending enough to recharge the economy - and Beijing has just announced a slew of stimulus measures to boost consumption.",
      "While tariffs can slow Chinese manufacturing, they cannot stop or replace it that easily, analysts say.",
      "\"Not only is China the big exporter, it is sometimes the only exporter like for solar panels. If you want solar panels you can only go to China,\" Ms Garcia-Herrero said.",
      "China had begun pivoting from making garments and shoes to advanced tech such  as robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) long before Trump became president. And that has given China an \"early mover\" advantage, not to mention the scale of production in the world's second-largest economy.",
      "Chinese factories can produce high-end tech in large quantities at a low cost, said Shuang Ding, chief China economist at Standard Chartered.",
      "\"It's really difficult to find a replacement... China's status as a market leader is very difficult to topple.\"",
      "How is China responding to Trump's tariffs?",
      "China has responded with counter tariffs of 10-15% on US agricultural goods, coal, liquefied natural gas, pick-up trucks, and some sports cars.",
      "And it has targeted US firms in aviation, defence and tech with export restrictions and announced an anti-monopoly investigation against Google.",
      "China has also spent years adapting to tariffs from Trump's first term. Some Chinese manufacturers have moved factories out of the country, for instance. And supply chains have come to rely more on Vietnam and Mexico by exporting from there to bypass the tariffs.",
      "And yet, Trump's recent  tariffs on Mexico would not hurt China too much because  Vietnam is a bigger backdoor for Chinese goods, Ms Garcia-Herrero said.",
      "\"Vietnam is the key here. If tariffs are imposed on Vietnam, I think it will be very tough,\" she said.",
      "What concerns China more than tariffs, analysts says, is US restrictions on advanced chips.",
      "These restrictions have been a major sticking point between the two countries but they have also fuelled China's determination to invest in homegrown tech that is independent of the West.",
      "It's why Chinese AI firm DeepSeek shocked Silicon Valley and unnerved Washington when it released a chatbot that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT. The firm had reportedly stockpiled Nvidia chips before the US began cutting off China's access to the most advanced ones.",
      "Although this could \"impact China's competitiveness, I don't think that would affect China's status as a manufacturing power,\" Mr Ding of Standard Chartered said.",
      "On the other hand, any ground China gains in advanced tech manufacturing will  boost its high-value exports.",
      "Trump's tariffs hit China hard before - this time, it's ready",
      "The truth behind your $12 dress: Inside the Chinese factories fuelling Shein's success",
      "How did China become a manufacturing superpower?",
      "It happened because of state support, an unrivalled supply chain and cheap labour, analysts say.",
      "\"The combination of globalisation, as well as China's pro-business policies and market potential, helped to attract the initial wave of foreign investors,\" Chim Lee, an analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit, told the BBC.",
      "The government then doubled down, investing heavily in building a sprawling network of roads and ports to bring in raw materials and take Chinese-made goods to the world. What also helped was a stable exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the US dollar.",
      "A shift in recent years towards advanced tech has made sure that it will continue to be relevant and ahead of its competitors, analysts say.",
      "China already has plenty of economic clout from being a manufacturing powerhouse. But there is also a political opportunity as Trump's tariffs upend America's relationship with the world.",
      "\"The door is ajar for China to position itself as an advocate of free trade and a stable global force,\" said Mr Cruise of Moody's.",
      "But that is not easy, given Beijing has been accused of flouting international trade norms, such as imposing a tariff of more than 200% on imports of Australian wine in 2020.",
      "Analysts say China must also look beyond the US, which is still the top destination for its exports. China is the third-biggest market for US exports, after Canada and Mexico.",
      "Chinese trade with Europe, South East Asia and Latin America has been growing, but it's hard to imagine that the world's two biggest economies can stop relying on each other."

    "summary": "One in five Indian households invest in the stock market, but the recent crash has left investors anxious.",
    "story": [
      "Two years ago, on his bank adviser's suggestion, Rajesh Kumar pulled out his savings - fixed deposits included - and shifted to mutual funds, stocks and bonds.",
      "With India's stock market booming, Mr Kumar, a Bihar-based engineer, joined millions investing in publicly traded companies. Six years ago, only one in 14 Indian households channelled their savings into the stock market - now, it's one in five.",
      "But the tide has turned.",
      "For six months, India's markets have slid as foreign investors pulled out, valuations remained high, earnings weakened and global capital shifted to China - wiping out $900bn in investor value since their September peak. While the decline began before US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, they have now become a bigger drag as more details emerge.",
      "India's benchmark Nifty 50 share index, which tracks the country's top 50 publicly traded companies, is on its longest losing streak in 29 years, declining for five straight months. This is a significant slump in one of the world's fastest-growing markets. Stock brokers are reporting that their activity has dropped by a third.",
      "\"For more than six months now, my investments have been in the red. This is the worst experience in the last decade that I have been invested in stock market,\" Mr Kumar says.",
      "Mr Kumar, 55, now keeps little money in the bank, having shifted most of his savings to the stock market. With his son's 1.8 million-rupee ($20,650; \u00a316,150) private medical college fee due in July, he worries about selling investments at a loss to cover it. \"Once the market recovers, I'm thinking of moving some money back to the bank,\" he says.",
      "His anxieties reflect those of millions of middle-class Indians who have poured into the stock market from cities big and small - part of a financial revolution.",
      "The go-to investment route is Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), where funds collect fixed monthly contributions. The number of Indians investing through SIPs has soared past 100 million, nearly trebling from 34 million five years ago. Many first-time investors, lured by the promise of high returns, enter with limited risk awareness - often influenced by a wave of social media \"finfluencers\" on platforms like Instagram and YouTube, a mixed bag of experts and amateurs alike.",
      "Meet Tarun Sircar, a retired marketing manager, and you get a glimpse of India's new investor.",
      "When his public provident fund - a government-backed tax-free investment - matured last year, he sought a way to secure his retirement. Burnt by past stock market losses, he turned to mutual funds - this time with an adviser's help and a buoyant market.",
      "\"I've put 80% of my savings into mutual funds, keeping just 20% in the bank. Now my adviser warns me - Don't check your investments for six months, unless you want a heart attack!\"",
      "For now, Mr Sircar isn't entirely sure if moving his retirement fund into the stock market was the right decision. \"I'm both ignorant and confident,\" he says with wry candour. \"Ignorant about what's happening and why the market is reacting this way, yet confident because Instagram 'experts' make investing sound like a fast track to millions. At the same time, I know I might be caught in a web of deception and hype.\"",
      "Mr Sircar says he was drawn to the markets by TV shows hyping stocks and excited chatter in WhatsApp groups. \"The TV anchors talk up the market and people in my WhatsApp group boast about their stock market gains,\" he says.",
      "In his sprawling apartment complex, even teenagers discuss investments - in fact, during a badminton game, a teenager gave him a hot tip on a telecom stock. \"When you hear all this around you, you start thinking - why not give it a shot? So I did, and then the markets crashed.\"",
      "Mr Sircar lives in hope. \"My fingers are crossed. I am sure the markets will recover, and my fund will be back in green.\"",
      "There are others who have taken more risks and already lost money. Lured by get-rich-quick videos, Ramesh (name changed), an accounting clerk from a small industrial town in western India, borrowed money to invest in stocks during the pandemic.",
      "Hooked to YouTube influencers, he dived into risky penny stocks and trading in derivatives. This month, after losing over $1,800 - more than his annual salary - he shut his brokerage account and swore off the market.",
      "\"I borrowed this money, and now creditors are after me,\" he says.",
      "Ramesh is one of 11 million Indians who lost a combined $20bn in futures and options trades before regulators stepped in.",
      "\"This crash is unlike the one during the Covid pandemic,\" says financial adviser Samir Doshi. \"Back then, we had a clear path to recovery with vaccines on the horizon. But with the Trump factor in play, uncertainty looms - we simply don't know what's next.\"",
      "Fuelled by digital platforms, low-cost brokerages and government-driven financial inclusion, investing has become more accessible - smartphones and user-friendly apps have simplified market participation, drawing a broader, younger audience seeking alternatives to traditional assets.",
      "On the flip side, many new Indian investors need a reality check. \"The stock market isn't a gambling den - you must manage expectations,\" says Monika Halan, author and financial educator. \"Invest in equity only what you won't need for at least seven years. If you're taking on risk, understand the downside: How much could I lose? Can I afford that loss?\"",
      "This market crash couldn't have hit India's middle class at a worse time. Economic growth is slowing, wages remain stagnant, private investment has been sluggish for years and job creation isn't keeping pace. Amid these challenges, many new investors, lured by rising markets, are now grappling with unexpected losses.",
      "\"In normal times, savers can take short-term setbacks, because they have steady incomes, which keep adding to their savings,\" noted Aunindyo Chakravarty, a financial analyst.",
      "\"Now, we are in the midst of a massive economic crisis for the middle-class. On the one side, white-collar job opportunities are reducing, and raises are low. On the other, the real inflation faced by middle-class households - as opposed to the average retail inflation that the government compiles - is at its highest in recent memory. A stock market correction at such a time is disastrous for middle-class household finances.\"",
      "Financial advisers like Jaideep Marathe believe that some people will start taking money out of the market and move them to safer bank deposits if the volatility continues for another six to eight months. \"We are spending a lot of time telling clients not to liquidate their portfolios and to treat this as a cyclical event.\"",
      "But clearly, all hope is not lost - most believe that the market is correcting itself from previous highs.",
      "Foreign investor selling has eased since February, suggesting the market downturn may be nearing its end, says veteran market expert Ajay Bagga. Following the correction, valuations for many stock market indices have dipped below their 10-year average, providing some respite.",
      "Mr Bagga expects GDP and corporate earnings to improve, aided by a $12bn income-tax giveaway in the federal budget and falling interest rates. However, geopolitical risks - Middle East and Ukraine conflicts, and Trump's tariff plans - will keep investors cautious.",
      "In the end, the market meltdown might serve as a hard lesson for new investors.",
      "\"This correction is a much-needed wake-up call for those who entered the market just three years ago, enjoying 25% returns - that's not normal,\" says Ms Halan. \"If you don't understand markets, stick to bank deposits and gold. At least you have control.\"",

    "story": [
      "Veteran actor Tony Danza says his current role as a tough-talking character as mob boss Stefano in \"Power Book III: Raising Kanan\" has allowed him to showcase a side of him that differs from the family-friendly persona established in classic sitcoms like \"Taxi\" and \"Who's the Boss?\"",
      "\"I get to do something that I wouldn't usually get called for,\" Danza told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"It's toward the end of your career, and to get something like this \u2014 one of the great things is we shoot in New York. So I sleep in my own bed.\"",
      "The 73-year-old actor appears to relish playing against type in the series, now entering its fourth season. He said he enjoys the show's dialogue, comparing it to being in a \"'40s gangster movie\" with lines like \"somebody's going to be wearing cement sneakers.\"",
      "Danza said the network has also been supportive of the show.",
      "\"I can tell when I'm in a good one,\" he said. \"This is the first time they have gone out of their way to promote it.\"",
      "When asked about a possible \"Who's the Boss?\" revival, Danza clarified it would be a sequel rather than a reboot.",
      "\"It's, 'Where are these people 30 or 40 years later?' And dealing with the issues of today in a funny way.\"",
      "Danza also discussed his involvement with a youth organization called Stars of Tomorrow Project Inc., which recently performed at New York's Triad Theater. Drawing from his own upbringing in Brooklyn during the 1950s and '60s, he described it as \"the toughest neighborhood in the city\" but also \"the greatest time to be alive.\"",
      "When asked about his decades-long acting career, Danza mentioned taking piano lessons and booking performance dates, emphasizing the importance of keeping an active mind.",
      "\"Exercise and moisturize,\" he said. \"And keep trying to expand.\"",

    "story": [
      "Actor Ione Skye, known for her breakout role in the 1989 film \"Say Anything,\" is giving fans a look behind her glamorous but tumultuous Hollywood life in a new memoir titled \"Say Everything.\"",
      "In her memoir, the 54-year-old actress reflects on a journey that began when she was just 15, starring alongside Keanu Reeves in \"River's Edge\" before sharing the screen with River Phoenix, Matthew Perry and John Cusack in the films that would cement her status as a teen idol.",
      "\"When I look back on the pictures, I almost can't take in how young I look,\" Skye said.",
      "The memoir also details her relationship with Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis, which began when she was 16 and he was 24.",
      "\"I liked the idea of this dangerous dark prince of a rock n' roller,\" she writes, though her perspective has shifted with time.",
      "\"It shocks me. And I also feel bad for myself,\" Skye said. \"I'm happy I knew Anthony Kiedis and \u00a0[Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist] Flea, but I wish I'd met them ten years later and never dated them.\"",
      "Kiedis struggled with heroin addiction during their relationship. When asked why she stayed, Skye said: \"I thought I had to save him.\"",
      "The actress later married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys at age 21, a relationship that lasted seven years before ending due to affairs Skye had with women. The end of this relationship in particular, Skye said, is difficult to look back on \u2013 even more than 25 years later.",
      "\"I discovered writing this book, it was very clear that I'm not good with grief. I'm not good with loss at all,\" she said. \"I still find it painful. I can't even listen to a Beastie Boys song. It feels like a death to me.\"",
      "She said she feels the pain comes from not only hurting a \"sweet person\" but also hurting herself.",
      "Much of Skye's memoir explores how her relationships were shaped by the absence of her father, Scottish singer Donovan Leitch, who left when she was born.",
      "\"Hearing his beautiful music was very painful sometimes because it's hard to see someone do beautiful art and think, 'Where is that for me?,\" she said.",
      "The book reveals a disturbing chapter when Leitch's attorney sent a letter requesting a paternity test when Skye was already a successful actress.",
      "\"I couldn't believe it,\" she said.",
      "Ultimately, Skye decided against taking the paternity test. Skye says she didn't meet her father until just before her 18th birthday.",
      "\"It was strange. I was really self-conscious in thinking we're touching right now for the first time and hugging,\" she recalled. \"The sad thing is I wanted more. Yeah, I just, and I still do. I wanted to just see him again.\"",
      "Skye would have another revelation when she was pregnant and splitting up with her fianc\u00e9, designer David Netto.",
      "\"I was in the shower, pregnant and sobbing because it was so stressful. And then I thought my mother probably was pregnant with me in a shower in 1969,\" she said. \"That's a very direct repeat of a pattern.\"",
      "Now living in Australia with her husband, musician Ben Lee, and their family, Skye says they share the same unique experience of early fame.",
      "\"Our careers were really big when we were teenagers and we've both had to deal with the ups and downs of keeping our careers going,\" she said.",
      "Five years ago, Skye took her family to visit her father and stepmother in Ireland, a trip she describes as healing. She also found connection with her father through her role in the film \"Zodiac,\" which featured one of his songs.",
      "Reflecting on completing her memoir, Skye called it \"an act of self-forgiveness.\"",
      "\"I felt very proud. I felt like I learned a lot about myself,\" she said. \"I felt like it's a bit of whiplash for a long time, but I do settle in a nice place.\"",

    "story": [
      "TV funnyman Conan O'Brien\u00a0took the stage as host of the 97th annual Academy Awards on Sunday night as the 2025 Oscar nominees competed for top honors.",
      "O'Brien inherited hosting duties from fellow comedian and late-night star\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel, who presided over the Oscars four times before.",
      "\"America demanded it and now it's happening: Taco Bell's new Cheesy Chalupa Supreme. In other news, I'm hosting the Oscars,\" O'Brien said in a statement when he was announced as host.",
      "O'Brien kept things moving in the broadcast and delivered some few comedic interludes, including a musical number in which he sang about not wasting the audience's time.",
      "The Oscars ceremony was broadcast on ABC on Sunday night from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood, in Los Angeles. \"Anora\" went home with five awards, including best picture. See the full list of winners here.",
      "Who is Conan O'Brien?",
      "Conan O'Brien is best known for hosting the late-night talk shows \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien,\" \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Conan.\"",
      "O'Brien, now 61, spent nearly three decades as a late-night host. In 2015, he became the \"longest-working current late night talk show host\" in the U.S., following David Letterman's retirement, according to TBS.",
      "This was his first time as the Oscar host, but he has done the honors for other high-profile awards shows, including hosting the Emmys in 2002 and 2006.",
      "Before he became a well-known TV personality, O'Brien was a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons.\"",
      "Who hosted the Oscars in the past?",
      "O'Brien joined an illustrious list of Oscar hosts that includes the likes of Johnny Carson, Billy Crystal, David Letterman, Whoopi Goldberg, Chris Rock, Jon Stewart, Hugh Jackman and Neil Patrick Harris.",
      "\"He joins an iconic roster of comedy greats who have served in this role, and we are so lucky to have him center stage for the Oscars,\" said Craig Erwich, president of the Disney Television Group, when O'Brien was named.",
      "Jimmy Kimmel, Whoopi Goldberg and Jack Lemmon have each hosted the show four times, while three-timers include Jerry Lewis and David Niven.",
      "Carson hosted five times and Crystal hosted for the ninth time in 2012.",
      "Bob Hope holds the record for the most times hosting the Oscars, serving as master of ceremonies 19 times.",
      "In 2014, Ellen DeGeneres, in her second time hosting the Academy Awards, set a record for the most retweets with a\u00a0celebrity-packed selfie\u00a0that included Bradley Cooper, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep.",
      "However, not all hosting choices work out quite as well.",
      "When Anne Hathaway co-hosted the ceremony with James Franco in 2012, it was widely panned\u00a0as the Academy's awkward attempt to attract younger viewers.",
      "In 2018, the Hollywood Reporter called being the Oscars host \"the least wanted job in Hollywood\" following Kevin Hart's\u00a0sudden departure\u00a0ahead of his planned 2019 hosting duties, amid controversy over some past comments.",
      "That year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences decided against having a host for the first time in 30 years and didn't have an official host again until 2022, when Regina Hall, Amy Schumer and Wanda Sykes co-hosted the ceremony. That show, however, was overshadowed by\u00a0Will Smith slapping Chris Rock\u00a0in the face onstage over a joke Rock made about Smith's wife,\u00a0Jada Pinkett Smith.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-hollywood-has-changed-filmmaking-in-the-age-of-streaming/",
    "published": "Sun, 02 Mar 2025 10:58:46 -0500",
    "summary": "Has the rise of streaming services, and the ability to watch movies on mobile phones, changed what we expect, or want, movies to be? A leading filmmaker, critic, and movie executives discuss the evolution of Hollywood's \"Dream Factory.\"",
    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "summary": "As host of \"The Tonight Show\" for 30 years, Johnny Carson was the king of late-night TV. But the public rarely saw his private side. A new biography, \"Carson the Magnificent,\" examines the late-night host's enduring impact, and his difficulties off-camera.",
    "story": [
      "It may not look like much now, but once upon a time, Stage 1 at the Burbank Studios was where the king of comedy held court, addressing his subjects at the end of each day. Johnny Carson presided over not just late night, but American popular culture.",
      "\"Johnny Carson was the biggest star in America,\" said writer Mike Thomas. \"Movie stars, rock stars, I don't think anybody was bigger than Johnny, because he was on night after night after night.\"",
      "Thomas' new book is \"Carson the Magnificent,\" a biography of Carson his late friend Bill Zehme started.",
      "Everybody who was anybody appeared on \"The Tonight Show,\" and 17 million Americans tuned in \u2013 many from their beds. It was Johnny Carson vs. sleep, and sleep usually lost. \"It did!\" said Thomas. \"I think Johnny brought a lot of people peace at the end of the day. People love to laugh, but I think he gave them hope that the world would go on the next day no matter what was happening.\"",
      "His audience \u2013 more than triple the size of all three current network late-night shows combined \u2013 made him the national agenda setter of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s.\u00a0 \"Johnny would say things and do things that became water cooler conversation the next morning,\" said Thomas.",
      "It also made Johnny the pre-eminent Hollywood talent broker for several generations. Fifty-seven years after comedian Robert Klein made the first of his 97 appearances on \"The Tonight Show,\" he's still grateful for the rocket fuel career boost that Carson's imprimatur provided. \"He's one of the most important people in my life, and we were not personal friends,\" Klein said.",
      "For his career, Klein said Carson was the most important: \"Appearances on that show were everything. I am a creature of 'The Tonight Show.' That was the vertebra of my career.\"",
      "Comedian George Wallace knew what was on the line when he did Carson: an invitation to \"The Tonight Show\" was a necessary bullet point on his resume \u2013 and each appearance was a climb up comedy's Everest. And then, when the routine would end, comedians would look nervously at the desk, waiting to see if Carson gave then the OK. \"Always got that,\" said Wallace.",
      "I asked, \"Were you looking for it?\"",
      "\"Hell, yeah. I was looking for it!\" he said.",
      "But what he was also looking for was a gesture from Carson to come over to the couch. \"I didn't get that,\" he said.",
      "Forty years later, this big-time comedy headliner still feels he didn't make the \"Tonight Show\" summit. I asked, \"What did that mean to get called over?\"",
      "\"That meant that you're in,\" said Wallace. \"You got called over, you're in the club.\" He said the fact that he did get that \"kinda hurts today.\"",
      "All that power, rested in the hands of a complicated man: master connector at work, cold and aloof at home. \"I think there were two Johnnys to a certain degree,\" said Thomas. \"On screen, impossibly cool guy. But there was also the side of Johnny that was introverted off-screen. I think some of the aloofness may have been introversion.\"",
      "In Mike Wallace's classic \"60 minutes\" profile in 1979, Carson acknowledged the dichotomy. He said, \"If I pulled out my old high school annual book and read some of the things, people might say, 'Oh he's conceited, he's aloof.' Actually that was more shy. See, when I'm in front of an audience, it's a different thing.\"",
      "Life with no audience was challenging for Carson. He was married four times. \"Johnny needed to be married for some reason; he needed to be with someone,\" said Thomas. \"He didn't need to stay married. They would fall out. Johnny's behavior would pry them apart. They just never lasted.\"",
      "But actress Dyan Cannon has a different story to tell. \"Aloof and cold? Never.\" She described him as \"Warm, open, willing. I've never known anyone like him. I've never known anyone like Johnny.\"",
      "And this from a woman who was married to Cary Grant. \"Cary was more of an enigma,\" said Cannon. \"Much more of a, 'Can I approach him or can't I?'\u00a0 But people would approach Johnny as if he were family.\"",
      "\"So, it was a different kind of star?\" I asked.",
      "\"There was nobody as big a star as Johnny.\"",
      "In a \"Tonight Show\" episode from October 1985, where Cannon and Carson are chatting, she flustered the normally unflappable Carson as she held his hand. \"Hi, sweetheart,\" she said.",
      "\"We've gone out a couple of times, right?\" he said.",
      "Cannon erupted in laughter \u2013 as did Cannon today, re-watching the video. \"He still makes me laugh,\" she said.",
      "Asked what exactly was going on there, Cannon laughed again: \"Well, you will never know! You will never, never know!\"",
      "\"You gotta give me a little somethin' here.\"",
      "\"Oh, no, I don't!\" she laughed.",
      "To hear her tell it, this was not a man who had trouble understanding women. \"How do I describe a relationship where you're so intimate with somebody, and yet, you haven't been intimate physically? We were closer than that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Would you describe it as a love affair?\"",
      "\"Yes, absolutely, a love affair,\" Cannon said. \"Absolutely. Real love. Physically, we were never together. But spiritually, we were.\"",
      "\"In some ways, it sounds like you're describing the love of your life?\"",
      "\"Isn't that interesting?\" said Cannon. \"Wow. Hope you're hearing this, Johnny!\"",
      "Maybe Carson was just like so many of us, full of contradictions \u2026 only ours aren't examined by millions under the brightest lights our culture has to offer. Whoever Johnny Carson was, safe to say, in our deeply fragmented culture, there will never be another.",
      "As Mike Thomas put it, \"We're all siloed. We're all watching things that either confirm our own biases or that are attuned to our own specific sense of humor. There will never be that communal experience again where people watch the show at the same time and then talk about the show the next day. It was a communal experience. That was part of the magic of Carson: community.\"",

      "What set Hackman apart? \"He was definitely part of a crop of interesting young Hollywood actors that kind of reinvented the mold,\" Rooney said. \"They were getting away from the traditional movie star, into something more approaching real people. He wasn't sort of a matinee idol-look, but it was at the point when people were looking beyond that to try and find some other kind of realism in movies.\"",

    "summary": "Many actors have launched their careers in horror movies. But two of our most acclaimed stars are now headlining a low-budget horror film: \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" about a psychopath terrorizing his fellow nursing home residents with a sinister doll puppet.",
    "story": [
      "It might be known as winter elsewhere, but in Hollywood, they call it \"awards season\" \u2026 and just about everyone's in town for tonight's grand finale. One of the stars of \"Conclave,\" John Lithgow, is looking forward to it. \"Yes, I haven't been to the Oscars in years.\"",
      "Lithgow says he really likes playing the bad guy.",
      "\"Everything you do seems like it's a lot of fun for you,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, I try to find things that are fun,\" Lithgow said. \"I don't go looking for them. They come to me. By now, I'm on a short list of actors, who is well known for being ready, willing, and able to do just about anything. So, wild roles come my way. Nothing normal!\"",
      "Also in town: esteemed actor Geoffrey Rush. He might live Down Under, but he's picked up a few awards up here, including a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy, or as he puts it, \"a TOE.\"",
      "We got both Rush and Lithgow in the same room to talk about something they've done together. In \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" Rush plays a wheelchair-bound stroke patient recovering in a nursing home, and Lithgow is the merciless bully who terrorizes his fellow residents, often with a sinister doll puppet, named Jenny Pen.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"The Rule of Jenny Pen,\" click on the video player below:",
      "If it looks like a low-budget horror film, that's because it is!",
      "\"Lot of times, this is how people get their start in the business \u2013 they do a low-budget horror movie,\" I said.",
      "\"This is where we ended up!\" said Rush.",
      "\"Geoffrey's just one of the great actors,\" said Lithgow. \"And you just read the script and said, 'This is a hell of a double act.'\"",
      "\"I thought I was reading for the doll!\" said Rush.",
      "Lithgow's character starts out as merely sinister, and quickly graduates to terrifying. It's the classic horror film villain, and for Lithgow, a role with teeth.",
      "Rush said, \"Typical John, he said, 'I've had some teeth made.' And I thought, 'You're my kind of actor,' because really, the first time I saw the face, I just went, 'This guy is creepy.'\"",
      "\"Look, we're in the impact business,\" Lithgow said. \"You're after making people laugh, cry, or scream out in terror. And this was scream-out-in-terror time, with deep feeling sort of invested in it.\"",
      "Lithgow's been evoking deep feelings for more than half a century. But before he was the acclaimed movie star. He was the acclaimed stage actor, the guy in David Storey's play \"The Changing Room\" who made winning a Tony look easy, picking up the award just two weeks after making his first appearance on a Broadway stage. \"I think I must have the record for the quickest win sprint from Broadway debut to a Tony Award,\" he said.",
      "Rush has a similar story: He also won a Tony for his Broadway debut, 2009's \"Exit the King.\" And the movie \"Shine,\" about real-life pianist David Helfgott, was only his second feature film. He still can't believe he took home the Oscar for best actor. \"It still doesn't make sense,\" he said.",
      "But it was hardly beginner's luck. Both Rush and Lithgow have had once-in-a-lifetime roles \u2026. again and again.",
      "I asked, \"Has there ever been a role that the guy sitting next to you had that you looked at and said either, 'Wow. That was perfect,' or, 'Ooh, I wish I could have played that'?\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"I don't know. I defer to an actor who does a much better job than I could possibly do in that role. I was the second choice for Hannibal Lecter. If Tony Hopkins had turned it down, it was coming to me. And there's no way I could have played that part as well as he did.\"",
      "\"Wow, that's a bold statement,\" said Rush.",
      "\"It's true! And I feel that way about Geoffrey in 'Shine.' That was his role. It belonged to him. And there's no point being \u2026\"",
      "\"What John doesn't know is that I got offered most of the roles that he's got first!\" Rush laughed.",
      "Truth is, just about any role they play is iconic. And with director James Ashcroft's \"Jenny Pen,\" they get to do something extra-special: act their age.",
      "Rush recalled, \"I said to James Ashcroft, 'How old is this judge in the film?' He said, 'How old are you now?' I said, 'I'm 73.' He said, 'Let's make him 73.' And that's the first time I've played my own age.\"",
      "Lithgow said, \"Geoffrey and I have the great advantage of having grown to a certain age where we are each other's only competition. You get the great old man roles dealing with big issues like mortality and facing the loss of your own viability and the loss of your own cognition. It's been a blessing. I mean, my career has sort of aged along with me. And who would have believed I would still be going strong at this point?\"",

      "The resignation of Thomas Corry, a Trump administration appointee, was first reported by Politico. Corry did not respond to multiple requests from CBS News for comment.",
      "Corry's departure came just days after Kennedy faced criticism for how he handled a question about the growing measles outbreak in Texas at a White House Cabinet meeting, calling it \"not unusual\" and misstating the number of deaths reported in the state.",
      "A former HHS official and a person familiar with Corry's thinking said that he had voiced disappointment with how Kennedy handled the question. It was a missed opportunity, making headlines for appearing indifferent to the deadly outbreak.",
      "But Corry's frustrations extended beyond that, as his office triaged a deluge of inquiries on agency actions ranging from canceled vaccines meetings to stalled research funding.",
      "Unlike previous officials in the role, who usually closely work with the secretary, Corry had been cut off from Kennedy, one former HHS official said. Federal officials said they were unsure if Corry had the trust of Kennedy or his inner circle, undermining his authority.",
      "In an interview with Fox News that aired Tuesday, Kennedy claimed he never met Corry and did not know much about his former top spokesperson.",
      "\"I think that individual had personnel problems and was about to be terminated, and so they may have made up a story to explain their termination, and then, you know, quit before he got that news,\" Kennedy said.",

      "Other factors driving spread that were cited by PAHO include increased movement of people around the Americas and an uptick in dengue, a mosquito-borne viral infection that can mask the spread of measles due to similar symptoms.",
      "What is measles elimination?",
      "The U.S. achieved measles elimination in 2000, after documenting a year of no endemic spread of the virus. WHO officials declared North and South America free of measles in 2016, making the Americas the first region to reach this milestone in the world.",
      "Health officials define \"measles elimination\" as proof of no endemic spread of the highly contagious virus within an area for at least 12 months. A continuous chain of transmission persisting for at least a year would reverse that goal.",
      "While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention usually reports hundreds of measles cases every year around the U.S., many are from short-lived outbreaks linked to unvaccinated young children who were recently outside the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 An Australian man credited with saving 2.4 million babies through his record-breaking blood plasma donations over six decades, has died, his family said Tuesday. He was 88.",
      "James Harrison, a retired state railway department clerk, died in a nursing home on the central coast of New South Wales state on Feb. 17, according to his grandson, Jarrod Mellowship.",
      "Harrison's plasma contained a rare antibody known as anti-D. It's used to make injections that protect unborn babies from hemolytic disease of the newborn, in which a pregnant woman's immune system attacks her fetus' red blood cells. The disease is most common when a woman has an Rh-negative blood type and her baby's is Rh-positive.",
      "Australia has only 200 anti-D donors. They help 45,000 mothers and their babies annually.",
      "Despite an aversion to needles, Harrison made 1,173 donations after he turned 18 in 1954 until he was forced to retire in 2018, at the age of 81.",
      "\"He did it for the right reasons. As humble as he was, he did like the attention. But he would never do it for the attention,\" Mellowship said, adding his grandfather had been surprised to be recognized by Guinness World Records in 2005 as the person who had donated the most blood plasma in the world.",
      "The record was beaten in 2022 by American Brett Cooper from Walker, Michigan.",
      "Australian blood service pays tribute to James Harrison",
      "The Australian Red Cross Blood Service\u00a0said Harrison was renowned as the \"Man with the Golden Arm.\"\u00a0That national agency, which is responsible for collecting and distributing blood products, is also known as Lifeblood.",
      "Its chief executive, Stephen Cornelissen, said Harrison had hoped that someone in Australia would one day beat his donation record.",
      "\"James was a remarkable, stoically kind and generous person who was committed to a lifetime of giving, and he captured the hearts of many people around the world,\" Cornelissen said in a statement.",
      "\"It was James' belief that his donations were no more important than any other donors' and that everyone can be special in the same way that he was,\" Cornelissen added.",
      "Lifeblood said that, \"It's with enormous gratitude that we acknowledge the generous life of James Harrison. ... We thank James for the incredible contribution he made and the millions of lives he has saved.\"",
      "Mellowship said his mother, Tracey Mellowship, Harrison's daughter, needed the treatment when he and his brother, Scott, were born.",
      "Jarrod Mellowship said his own wife, Rebecca, also needed the treatment when three of their four children were born.",
      "How James Harrison's blood might have acquired its unique feature",
      "There is speculation that Harrison developed high concentrations of anti-D as a result of his own blood transfusions during major lung surgery when he was 14.",
      "\"After the surgery, his dad, Reg, told grandad you're only really alive because people donated blood,\" Jarrod Mellowship said. \"The day he turned 18, he started donating.\"",
      "The application of anti-D in fighting hemolytic disease of the newborn wasn't discovered until the 1960s.",
      "Harrison, who was born in New South Wales, is survived by his sister, Margaret Thrift, his daughter, two grandsons and four great-grandchildren.",

      "A recent Harvard Business Review\u00a0article identified a phenomenon called \"meeting hangovers\" which new research shows can derail productivity well beyond the meeting itself.",
      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",

      "Best Buy CEO Corie Barry said this week that the electronics retailer is particularly exposed to the tariffs, noting that China and Mexico are the two largest suppliers of the company's products.",
      "\"[W]e expect our vendors across our entire assortment will pass along some level of tariff costs to retailers, making price increases for American consumers highly likely,\" Barry said in a March 4 call with Wall Street analysts to discuss the company's latest financial results.",
      "The new 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada, plus a move to tack an additional 10% levy on to an existing 10% tariff on Chinese imports, took effect Tuesday. Those costs are borne largely by U.S. importers, usually leading to price hikes for shoppers.",
      "While Barry said the tariffs will lead to price increases, she didn't specify how big they would be.",
      "\"I think it is fair to say... that tariffs at this level will result in price increases. I think it is very difficult to say given the backdrop that we're in, exactly precisely how big that is,\" Barry added later in the call in response to a question from an analyst.",
      "A Walmart executive told\u00a0NBC News\u00a0in February that it would not be \"immune\" to the impact of such levies.",

      "The\u00a0U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0this week urged the Trump administration to reconsider the sweeping new tariffs, saying they force businesses to choose between hiking prices or risk going out of business.",

      "Franco Salerno, who owns Darianna Bridal and Tuxedo in Warrington, Pennsylvania, told the Chamber of Commerce the company is printing new price tags to reflect the increased costs dress designers expect to incur and pass along to Darianna's, due to the tariffs.",
      "\"Dress designers are already notifying us that they are raising prices to cover any tariffs,\" Salerno told the trade group.",
      "The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), a trade organization representing retailers, also called on President Trump to reconsider his tariff policy.",
      "\"The American people are counting on President Trump to bring down costs and grow the U.S. economy,\" Michael Hanson, RILA's senior executive vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. \"Tariffs on Canada and Mexico put those goals in serious jeopardy and risk destabilizing the North American economy.

    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

      "Because importers pay the tariffs \u2014 such as Walmart, which imports goods from China and other nations \u2014 U.S. businesses will shoulder the added costs. While some companies may opt to swallow all or part of the expense, some of the costs are likely to be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices, economists say.",
      "\"If there is a significant increase in tariffs ... those costs will likely be passed onto U.S. consumers and businesses,\" Brian Peck, executive director of University of Southern California's Center for Transnational Law and Business, told CBS Los Angeles.",
      "The typical American family could face higher annual costs of between $1,600 to $2,000 due to the new tariffs, according to a new analysis from the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan public policy research center.",
      "What will cost more with tariffs?",
      "Products imported directly from Canada, Mexico and China could see price hikes as businesses pass along the tariff costs, either in full or in part, to consumers. But some products that are made in the U.S. but which use imported materials could also see higher prices, such as automobiles that are manufactured domestically but rely on parts imported from Canada, Mexico or China.",
      "Consumers could start seeing higher prices for some products fairly quickly, such as gasoline, with some regions expected to see gas prices jump as much as 40 cents per gallon within days, according to GasBuddy energy analyst Patrick De Haan.",
      "But other goods, such as cars, might not reflect higher prices for several months, experts say.",
      "Vegetables, fruit, beef, beer and spirits",
      "The U.S. imported more than $45 billion worth of agricultural products from Mexico in 2023. Almost three-quarters of such imports consisted of vegetables, fruit, beer, tequila and other drinks and spirits,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "At the same time, the U.S. imported roughly $40 billion worth of Canadian agricultural products, including beef, pork, grains, potatoes and canola oil, the USDA notes.",
      "Subject to 25% tariffs, prices on such products could rise substantially, depending on how much of the cost increase businesses pass along to shoppers. Fresh produce prices could increase by about 3%, while food prices overall may increase by 2%, according to a new analysis from Democrats on Congress' Joint Economic Committee.",
      "According to the\u00a0Atlanta Fed, the tariffs on three key U.S. trading partners would bring up prices on everyday purchases, including food and beverages, by as much as 1.63%, if businesses pass along anywhere from half to all of the added costs to consumers.",
      "Electronics",
      "The tariffs are likely to drive up prices on a range of consumer goods, including laptops and tablets, video game consoles and smartphones, according to an analysis from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).",
      "Computers, phones and other electronics could see prices jump by 11%, according to the Joint Economic Committee analysis.",
      "That's a reality electronics retailer Best Buy acknowledged last year\u00a0as Mr. Trump spoke about relying on tariffs to achieve his economic goals.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told investors in the company's Nov. 26 earnings call, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "Automobiles",
      "Vehicles are expected to be hit hard by the tariffs, given their complex supply chains which can involve car parts crossing borders multiple times over the course of assembly, exposing them to the same levies more than once.",
      "The sweeping tariffs could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, which could dent automobile sales, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told\u00a0CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Some automakers could ditch uneconomical product lines as a result of the tariffs. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Gasoline",
      "Fuel prices could quickly reflect the new tariffs, according to De Haan of GasBuddy. Oil, natural gas and electricity imported from Canada will be subject to a 10% levy that could lead to higher prices almost immediately for U.S. motorists.",
      "\"Some U.S. regions will see price impacts rather quickly, while others will see a delay of 1-3 weeks,\" De Haan wrote in a March 4 blog post.",
      "Drivers in the Northeast are likely to see the biggest immediate impact, with gas prices jump by between 20 to 40 cents per gallon by mid-March, he added. \"For a typical 15-gallon fill-up, that's an additional $3-$6 every time you visit the pump,\" he said.",
      "Other regions are also likely to see higher gas prices, with Midwest drivers seeing an increase of 5-20 cents per gallon and Great Lakes motorists likely to pay about 10-25 cents per gallon more due to the new tariffs, he added.",

    "story": [
      "Beijing \u2014 China has responded to President Trump's trade war with defiance, something Mr. Trump is not accustomed to. Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs. The air of strength from Beijing was projected clearly on Wednesday at the opening of the National People's Congress.",
      "Thousands of delegates from around the country descended on the Chinese capital's central Tiananmen Square. Dressed in their finery, including some in traditional garments, they came to Beijing for the most important event in China's political calendar. But for the members of China's rubber-stamp legislature, certain topics were clearly off limits when speaking with CBS News.",
      "None of the legislators would respond when asked about any concerns they might have regarding the trade war between the world's two largest economies, or whether Presidents Trump and Xi Jinping might be able to get over their differences.",
      "Once inside the cavernous Great Hall of the People, the cameras turned to the main event. While the NPC is focused mainly on China's sluggish economy, this year, that discussion and the public proclamations are being overshadowed by geopolitical events \u2014 and the trade war with the U.S. in particular.",
      "President Xi, who's government announced its retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. just one day before the NPC opened, was an observer at the massive gathering on Wednesday. His deputy, Premier Li Qiang, delivered the keynote address.",
      "He announced an ambitious\u00a0GDP growth target of 5% and committed more fiscal resources aimed at stimulating the economy, which is mired in youth unemployment and weak consumer spending, in addition to the lingering fallout from a property crisis.",
      "Li acknowledged the geopolitical tension China is facing, including a reference to the escalating trade war that, at least from public view, shows no signs of abating.",
      "But some of the Chinese delegates in attendance tried to remain hopeful, at least when speaking with CBS News.",
      "\"As this sort of rivalry goes on, there will come a point where we can have a good settlement,\" predicted Delegate Lin Shun-chao, from Hong Kong.",
      "While many Chinese people hope Beijing and Washington will eventually reach a trade deal, it's worth noting how stock markets in both countries have reacted to the tit-for-tat tariffs thus far: Chinese stocks overall are up about 15% from the beginning of the year, while U.S. markets are down almost 2%.",
      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

    "story": [
      "The Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports near the Panama Canal has agreed to sell shares of its units that operate the ports to a consortium including BlackRock Inc., after President Trump alleged Chinese interference with the operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "In a press release, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and all shares in Hutchison Port Group Holdings, in a deal valued at $22.8 billion. The two units hold 80% of the Hutchison Ports group that operates 43 ports in 23 countries, including two of the four major ports that exist along the Panama Canal. The deal will give the BlackRock consortium control over 43 ports in 23 countries, including Mexico, the Netherlands, Egypt, Australia, Pakistan and elsewhere.",
      "The consortium, comprised of BlackRock, Global Infrastructure Partners and Terminal Investment Limited will acquire 90% interests in Panama Ports Company, which owns and operates the ports of Balboa and Cristobal in Panama, according to the filing.",
      "\"This agreement is a powerful illustration of BlackRock and GIP's combined platform and our ability to deliver differentiated investments for clients. These world-class ports facilitate global growth,\" BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said in a joint announcement with TilL of the deal. \"Through our deep connectivity to organizations like Hutchison and MSC/TIL and governments around the world, we are increasingly the first call for partners seeking patient, long-term capital. We are thrilled our clients can participate in this investment.",
      "In January, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, raised concerns that China could exploit or block passage through the canal and that the ports \"give China ready observation posts\" to take action. \"This situation, I believe, posts acute risks for U.S. national security,\" Cruz said.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio visited Panama in early February and told President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino that Panama had to reduce Chinese influence over the canal or face potential retaliation from the United States. Mulino rejected the idea that China had any control over canal operations.",
      "Panama quit China's Belt and Road Initiative following Rubio's visit, drawing condemnation from Beijing.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the move in his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, saying that \"to further enhance our national security, our administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.\"",
      "\"Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal, and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal, and a couple of other canals,\" the president said.",
      "Victory for Trump",
      "With 40 million container ships passing through every year, the Panama Canal \u2014 a 51 mile waterway that cuts through Central America, linking the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans \u2014 is vital to the U.S. economy. Disputes over the canal were first sparked in 2024 when Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, made accusations that Chinese companies have taken control of the ports.",
      "But while much attention was focused on Mr. Trump's threat to retake control of the canal, his administration trained its sights on Hutchison Ports, the Hong Kong-based consortium that manages the canal's key ports, at either end of the canal. As a result of BlackRock's deal with CK Hutchison Holding, those two key ports will be placed under American control.",
      "The United States is the canal's largest user, with about 70% of shipping traffic going through the canal either coming to or from the U.S. Its second largest user is China.",
      "Hutchison Ports had recently been awarded a 25-year no-bid extension to run the ports, but an audit looking at that extension was already underway. Observers believed the audit was a preliminary step toward eventually rebidding the contract, but rumors had swirled in recent weeks that a U.S. firm close to the White House was being lined up to take over.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's imposition of blanket 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico drew swift vows of retaliation from the United States' immediate neighbors on Tuesday. China, which was hit with a second 10% tariff on U.S. exports since Mr. Trump took office, bringing the total levy to 20%, immediately announced its own reciprocal measures \u2014 deliberately targeting America's agricultural sector.",

      "Below is a look at the measures being imposed or planned by Canada, China and Mexico, and the rhetoric coming from officials in those countries as Mr. Trump ramps up his trade war against one of America's biggest adversaries, and its two closest neighbors.",
      "Canada announces reciprocal tariffs; Trudeau calls Trump's move \"a very dumb thing to do\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced immediate retaliation to the new U.S. tariffs in a statement late Monday evening. He said Canada would impose a $30 billion counter-tariff on goods imported from the U.S. immediately, escalating to $155 billion worth of American products within the next 21 days. Trudeau has said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances, along with Florida orange juice, with its measures.",
      "\"Canada will not let this unjustified decision go unanswered,\" Trudeau said, adding that he was already discussing with Canada's provincial leaders various non-tariff measures that could be imposed if the Trump administration doesn't lift its tariffs.",
      "\"Because of the tariffs imposed by the U.S., Americans will pay more for groceries, gas, and cars, and potentially lose thousands of jobs. Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship. They will violate the very trade agreement that was negotiated by President Trump in his last term,\" Trudeau said.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Trudeau lashed out at President Trump's decision.",
      "\"We should be working together to ensure even greater prosperity for North Americans in a very uncertain and challenging world,\" he said. \"Now, it's not in my habit to agree with the Wall Street Journal, but Donald, they point out that even though you're a very smart guy, this is a very dumb thing to do.\"",
      "\"Today the United States launched a trade war against Canada, their closest partner and ally, their closest friend. At the same time, they're talking about working positively with Russia, appeasing Vladimir Putin, a lying murderous dictator. Make that make sense,\" said Trudeau. \"We two friends fighting is exactly what our opponents around the world want to see.\"",
      "Trudeau also said Canada will challenge the U.S. action by filing dispute resolution claims at the World Trade Organization and through the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the trade deal that replaced NAFTA.",
      "Mr. Trump responded with a post on social media threatening to raise tariffs further: \"Please explain to Governor Trudeau, of Canada, that when he puts on a Retaliatory Tariff on the U.S., our Reciprocal Tariff will immediately increase by a like amount!\"",
      "Some of Canada's state leaders have pushed for a tougher response.",
      "\"If they want to try to annihilate Ontario, I will do everything, including cut off their energy with a smile on my face. And I'm encouraging every other province to do the same; Quebec, Manitoba, BC [British Columbia], we all have to act in unison,\" Doug Ford, the Premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, said at an industrial convention on Monday. \"They rely on our energy. They need to feel the pain. They want to come at us hard. We're going to come back twice as hard.\"",
      "Ford said retaliatory measures that Canada could consider going forward included halting shipments of critical minerals such as uranium, potash and nickel, in addition to cutting the energy supply, which he said could leave 1.5 million people without power in New York, Michigan and Minnesota, potentially causing significant disruptions to the U.S. economy.",
      "He said he had also asked officials in his province to end billions of dollars in contracts with the U.S. and to stop the import of American alcohol to Ontario.",
      "\"It's going to be an absolute disaster for both countries,\" he acknowledged in a separate interview with NBC News. \"I don't want to respond, but I will respond like they have never seen before.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has framed his tariffs on Canada as a response to what he says is the country's failure to stem the flow of both undocumented immigrants and fentanyl across the northern U.S. border \u2014 though very little of the drug enters that way, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency.",
      "In a message posted to his own Truth social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump also took issue with Canadian banking regulations, saying the country \"doesn't allow American Banks to do business in Canada, but their banks flood the American Market,\" but providing no further context.",
      "\"I heard he talked about banking again this morning,\" Trudeau said during his Tuesday news conference, \"which doesn't make any sense, because American banks \u2014 of 16 American banks currently active in Canada \u2014 holding about $113 billion worth of assets in this country. So the American banks are alive and well and prospering in Canada. It's an example of not really being able to see what it is that he [Trump] wants, because even the excuse that he's giving for these tariffs today of fentanyl is completely bogus, completely unjustified, completely false. So we actually have to fall back on the one thing he has said repeatedly, that what he wants is to see a total collapse of the Canadian economy, because that will make it easier to annex us.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that Canada should become a U.S. \"51st state.\"",
      "Trudeau defended Canada's actions on border control and the illegal flow of fentanyl on Monday, saying that between December 2024 and January 2025, seizures of the drug from Canada by U.S. authorities dropped 97%, to just 0.03 pounds. That drop came, he said, after Canada implemented a $1.3 billion plan to deploy more helicopters and more boots on the ground, and to appoint a \"Fentanyl Czar.\"",
      "China announces tariffs, warns against \"maximum pressure\" tactic",
      "Mr. Trump has long accused China of giving its manufacturers and other businesses an unfair advantage in trade with the U.S. and vowed to balance the extremely lopsided flow of goods. But he has framed his latest round of tariffs on the country as punishment for what he claims is a Chinese refusal to crack down on the flow of fentanyl and the chemicals used to make it to the U.S.",
      "China's government has refused to back down in the face of the escalating trade war with the Trump administration, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian telling reporters in Beijing on Tuesday that the \"Chinese people cannot be swayed by fallacies, deterred by intimidation, and bullying tactics are not the right way to deal with China.\"",
      "\"Attempting to exert maximum pressure on China is targeting the wrong opponent and is a misreading of the situation. If the U.S. truly wants to resolve the fentanyl issue, it should engage in consultation with China built on the principles of equality, respect, and mutual benefit to address each other's concerns,\" he said, according to China's official media.",
      "\"If the U.S. has other intentions and is committed to waging a tariff war, trade war, or any other kind of war, China will respond in kind,\" Lin said, adding a call for the White House \"to abandon its bullying tactics and return to the necessary track of dialogue and cooperation at an early date.\"",
      "China retaliated immediately, announcing its own 10-15% tariff on U.S. agricultural products and foods, from wheat, corn and cotton to soybeans, beef, chicken and dairy. Beijing also placed 25 U.S. firms under export and investment restrictions, citing what it said were national security concerns.",
      "Veteran Chinese analyst Victor Gao told CBS News that while China's counter-tariffs will impact U.S. farmers \u2014 perceived by Beijing to be among Mr. Trump's support base \u2014 he believes Beijing is being measured in its response and that it doesn't want to inflame the situation.",
      "Gao, who has worked with the country's leadership and is now vice president of the Center for China and Globalization in Beijing, said China is better prepared for a trade war with the U.S. than it was during Mr. Trump's first term, as it has diversified into other, non-U.S. markets.",
      "He said if President Xi Jinping really wanted to step up Beijing's retaliation, it could halt imports of U.S. gas and oil, but he warned against the implications for both nations if the trade war continues to escalate, saying at best, it would end in a \"bloody tie.\"",
      "But Gao said he believed talks were still going on behind the scenes between U.S and Chinese officials, and that both countries likely have little interest in a deteriorating, tit-for-tat tariffs battle.",
      "Mexican president vows retaliation to \"inconceivable\" tariffs",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that her country would respond to the 25% tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with its own retaliatory tariffs and non-tariff measures, but held off announcing exactly what those would be, promising a statement on Sunday in Mexico City's main square. She said she was scheduled to have a call with Mr. Trump this week, probably on Thursday.",
      "She said the reciprocal measures Mexico would take were \"not in any way or with the purpose of starting an economic or commercial confrontation that unfortunately and regrettably is the opposite of what we must be doing.\"",
      "\"It's inconceivable that they don't think about the damage this is going to cause to United States citizens and businesses with the increase in prices for things produced in our country,\" Sheinbaum said. \"Also, the damage it will cause by stopping job creation in both countries. No one wins with this decision.\"",
      "Sheinbaum stressed how Mexico had been working alongside the U.S. to respond to requests by Mr. Trump to stop the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and to reinforce the U.S.-Mexico border to curb migration.",
      "\"We collaborate to avoid illegal drug trafficking to the United States, but as we have said on multiple occasions, that country's government must take responsibility, too, for the crisis of opioid consumption that has caused so many deaths in the United States,\" the Mexican leader said.",
      "\"There is no motive or reason, nor justification that supports this decision that will affect our people and our nations,\" added Sheinbaum.",

      "\"Everything from cars to agricultural products will see cost surges, exacerbating inflationary pressures that had only recently shown signs of easing,\" said Nigel Green, the CEO of investment advisory firm de Vere Group, in an email.",
      "Stocks tumbled on Monday after Mr. Trump said the tariffs would move forward on March 4, with the S&P 500 shedding 1.8%, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. Wall Street continued the sell-off on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite both losing 1.7% in early morning trading. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 1.5%.",
      "China, Canada and Mexico react",
      "China responded immediately, announcing it would put additional tariffs of up to 15% on imports of key U.S. farm products, including chicken, pork, soy and beef. They're slated to take effect March 10. China also imposed export controls and other curbs on about two dozen more U.S. companies.",
      "What's more, foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said, \"If the United States ... persists in waging a tariff war, a trade war, or any other kind of war, the Chinese side will fight them to the bitter end,\" according to Agence France-Presse.",
      "Faced with Trump's tariffs, some Chinese firms simply relocate",
      "Faced with Trump's tariffs, some Chinese firms simply relocate",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his nation would respond with 25% tariffs on some $107 billion worth of U.S. goods over the course of three weeks \u2014 with $20.7 billion immediately \u2014 if the U.S. levies remained in effect. He had said previously that Canada would target American beer, wine, bourbon and home appliances and Florida orange juice.",
      "\"Tariffs will disrupt an incredibly successful trading relationship,\" the Reuters news agency quoted Trudeau as saying.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford told NBC News he was prepared to retaliate by ending shipments of nickel and the transmission of electricity to the U.S. from his province.",
      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico will respond with its own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Sheinbaum said she will announce the products Mexico will target on Sunday in a public event in Mexico City's central plaza, perhaps indicating Mexico still hopes to de-escalate the trade war set off by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Did Canada have tariffs on U.S. products before?",
      "Canada had imposed some limited tariffs on U.S. products before 2025, and vice versa. Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, which was signed by President Trump in 2020, the countries had negotiated a complex set of rules aimed at promoting trade.",
      "One of the biggest changes in the USMCA pact was providing American farmers greater access to Canada's dairy markets. That included a plan\u00a0eliminating existing Canadian-imposed tariffs on some U.S. dairy products over a number of years, including whey and margarine.",
      "The U.S. has also previously imposed tariffs on some Canadian products, including duties placed by the first Trump administration on imported softwood lumber. Under the Biden administration, the tariffs on Canadian lumber rose from 8% to 14.5% in 2024.",
      "Impact on markets, consumers",
      "Economists warn that the new tariffs could lead to higher prices for American consumers and a trade war among major U.S. trading partners.",

      "Trump's new tariffs could hike car prices by $12,000, report says",
      "Investors\u00a0reacted negatively\u00a0to Monday's news that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada would take effect as planned, with the stock market slumping on Monday and Tuesday. Trade war fears sent markets falling in Asia and Europe, as well on Tuesday.",
      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in an email. \"The sell-off that we are beginning to see has room to run (to the downside) as long as the tariff threats remain more than idle talk.\"",
      "On Monday, a reporter asked Mr. Trump if there was room left for Canada and Mexico to arrive at a deal before the deadline.",
      "\"No room left for Mexico or for Canada, no,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"The tariffs, they're all set, they go into effect tomorrow.\"",
      "He has wielded tariffs as an instrument to extract concessions from foreign governments and encourage manufacturing in the U.S.",
      "\"It's a very powerful weapon that politicians haven't used because they were either dishonest, stupid, or paid off in some other form,\" he said at the White House Monday after announcing a $100 billion investment by a Taiwanese semiconductor company. \"And now we're using them.\"",
      "The tariffs are in response to what Mr. Trump views as Mexico and Canada's irresponsible handling of the southern and northern borders, including\u00a0fentanyl entering the United States. Both countries won last-minute delays on the tariffs in February after Sheinbaum and Trudeau vowed to do more to crack down on fentanyl and illegal border crossings.",

The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks.",

      "\"The market finally took the Trump administration at its word, and the realization that the tariff talk wasn't just a negotiating tactic is starting to sink in,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management in a note yesterday. The market's trajectory could continue downward, he added, depending on how long the tariffs remain in effect.",
      "The burgeoning trade war between the U.S., China, Canada and Mexico is helping to extend a recent slump for U.S. stocks that was prompted by signs of weakness in the economy. Shares of Target and Best Buy fell on Tuesday after the retailers warned of higher prices for consumers due to tariffs.",
      "Markets in Europe fell sharply while stocks in Asia saw more modest declines.",

      "\"I don't think China will buy any more U.S. farm products. The orders will go to South America,\" Lun said. \"I think all in all, it's a lose-lose situation. Nobody gains anything.\"",
      "Anxiety over tariffs is also bleeding into the corporate side of the economic equation. Target reported Tuesday that sales and profit in the crucial holiday quarter both fell from a year ago, though they were better than expected. The Minnesota retailer said there will be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year because of tariffs and other costs.",
      "Shares of Target and Best Buy fell after the retailers warned of pressure on sales and higher prices for consumers. Target shares tumbled $3.62, or 3.0%, to $117.14.",
      "Many had hoped Mr. Trump would choose a less painful path on global trade. Monday's loss shaved the S&P 500's gain since Election Day down to just over 1% from a peak of more than 6%. That rally had been built largely on hopes for policies from Mr. Trump that would strengthen the U.S. economy and businesses.",
      "After the S&P 500 set a record  last month following a parade of fatter-than-expected profit reports from big U.S. companies, the market began diving following weaker-than-expected reports  on the U.S. economy, including a couple showing U.S. households are getting much more pessimistic  about inflation because of the threat of tariffs. Such pessimism is not unwarranted, according to analysts.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:57:59 -0500",
    "summary": "A spike in cryptocurrency prices Monday morning after President Donald Trump's surprise Sunday announcement quickly fizzled by Monday afternoon.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Sunday that his administration is working toward creating a \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin and ethereum, along with lesser-known cryptocurrencies XRP, solana, and cardano. He later followed up with another post saying his planned reserve would also include bitcoin and ether, the two most popular cryptocurrencies.",
      "The announcement helped crypto prices rebound after recent sell-offs, but only for a few hours. After rising to $90,000 Monday morning, bitcoin fell to roughly $87,000, or 7.3%, by Monday afternoon. Ethereum tumbled 14.6% to $2,153. Massive price spikes in XRP, solana and cardano also fizzled, dropping 12.1%, 13% and 12.3%, respectively.",
      "Nic Puckrin, financial analyst, investor and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, said in a note that the cause of the temporary price boost was most likely a \"combination of 'hopium' with a classic short squeeze,\" adding that more concrete information on the crypto reserve plan is needed to reassure investors of its worth.",
      "\"While the crypto reserve announcement was a bullish catalyst for crypto prices in the short term, its long-term impact remains questionable. For one thing, no actual details have been disclosed yet,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That said, the creation of digital currency reserve is a milestone moment for bitcoin and blockchain technology.",
      "\"The launch of a U.S. crypto strategic reserve marks a pivotal moment for digital assets, reflecting a major step in the government's engagement with the crypto industry,\" said Federico Brokate, head of the U.S. business at 21Shares, in an analyst note. \"This initiative not only reinforces Bitcoin's role as a maturing store of value but also highlights the importance of blockchain networks like ethereum, solana, XRP and cardano in financial infrastructure, payments and decentralized finance.\"",
      "What is a crypto strategic reserve?",
      "As described in the president's executive order\u00a0from January 23, the crypto strategic reserve would be a national stockpile of digital assets created under a federal regulatory framework developed by the newly established Presidential Working Group on Digital Asset Markets.",
      "The working group will be chaired by high ranking officials, including the White House AI & crypto czar, the secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, among others.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump pledged support for a \"strategic national bitcoin\" stockpile, which would include bitcoin the U.S. government has previously seized in law enforcement actions. Sunday's announcement was the first time he advocated for the government to hold other types of cryptocurrencies.",
      "How the crypto strategic reserve would be structured and maintained is not yet clear, as the White House did not immediately provide additional details, including how much of each type of cryptocurrency Trump wants the U.S. to hold, and how the government would acquire them.",
      "But more information could be revealed this week, as Trump has also recently announced he will speak at and host industry leaders on Friday at a White House \"Crypto Summit.\"",
      "\"The first White House Crypto Summit on Friday will be crucial to watch,\" said Puckrin. \"We will be waiting to see who will be there, what will be discussed, and whether any actual steps toward implementation are outlined. The key question is, how will they fund and legislate this reserve? Until we have some answers, there's little substance to support this rally, and it could fizzle out as quickly as it started.\"",
      "What's the point of a strategic crypto reserve?",
      "Similar to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which protects the U.S. economy from disruptions in oil supplies, a national crypto reserve would help diversify government holdings and hedge against financial risks, according advocates of the plan.",
      "Critics, however, say the volatility of cryptocurrencies makes them a poor choice as a reserve asset.",
      "Potential hurdles",
      "Creating a crypto strategic reserve is likely to require an act from Congress, just as with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which was created in December 1975 when then President Gerald Ford signed the Energy Policy and Conservation Act.",
      "Also, the inclusion of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin is likely to face sustained pushback among some corners of the heavily divided cryptocurrency industry. Bitcoin is the oldest and by far most popular cryptocurrency, and accounts for more than half of the world's global crypto market cap.",
      "The president has cast himself as hero to the crypto industry, which he said in his announcement had been the target of \"years of corrupt attacks by the Biden administration.\" The crypto industry felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win election.",
      "The first several weeks of his administration have seen several moves to boost crypto, including ending or pausing high-profile enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Crypto prices soared after Trump's victory last year, and when the price of bitcoin first crossed $100,000 in early December, Trump took credit and posted \"YOU'RE WELCOME!!!\" on social media.",
      "But prices have fallen since Trump's inauguration and Trump has faced criticism, including from allies within the crypto industry, for helping launch a personal meme coin just before he took office that has since collapsed in value.",
      "The crash of meme coins linked to First Lady Melania Trump and Argentine President Javier Milei, along with a massive hack of a major cryptocurrency exchange that the FBI has said was undertaken by North Korea, have also dimmed enthusiasm for crypto.",

    "published": "Mon, 03 Mar 2025 17:55:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's how new tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China could impact car prices for consumers, according to a new analysis.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's tariffs on three key U.S. trade partners, which are set to go into effect\u00a0Tuesday, could drive up automobile costs for U.S. consumers by thousands of dollars and put a dent in U.S. car sales, industry analysts and U.S.-based automakers say.",
      "The 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers.",
      "The price hikes from Mr. Trump's tariffs are likely to be substantial enough that some car buyers might balk at the higher costs, according to AEG CEO Patrick Anderson.",
      "\"Our analysis shows the proposed tariffs would have a very big effect on North American assembled cars by multiple automakers,\" Anderson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"These are cost increases that cannot be hidden from the consumer. Substantial portions, or perhaps all of it will be passed along to consumers, or manufacturers will stop producing them.\"",
      "Some product lines and equipment combination could become uneconomical for automakers to continue producing, he noted. \"It would be a huge disruption to the industry,\" Anderson said.",
      "Which vehicles could see the greatest price increases?",
      "The range of added costs on vehicles could run from $4,000 to $10,000, with the cost of producing some electric vehicles that rely heavily on components from China rising by as much as $12,200, according to AEG's analysis.",
      "Here are the projected impacts of the tariffs on some types of popular vehicles, according to the study:",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200Full-size SUV: $9,000Pickup truck: $8,000Small car: $6,200",
      "Battery-powered electric crossover vehicles: +$12,200",
      "Full-size SUV: $9,000",
      "Pickup truck: $8,000",
      "Small car: $6,200",
      "Tariff-driven cost increases may lead to a \"potential loss of sales\" for domestic automakers, given that consumers might turn to the used car market, or seek out automobiles assembled in Japan, for example, for cheaper alternatives, Anderson added.",
      "\"Or, they could decide simply not to buy one at all,\" he said.",
      "Automobile supply chains are complex because they involve numerous parts, some of which can cross borders more than once over the course of the assembly process. With tariffs added to the equation, costs could quickly escalate for automakers.",
      "\"The automobile sector, in particular, is likely to see considerable negative consequences, not only because of the disruption of the supply chains that crisscross the three countries in the manufacturing process, but also because of the expected increase in the price of vehicles, which can dampen demand,\" Cornell University professor of government and public policy Gustavo Flores-Macias said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Dan Hearsch, Americas leader of the automotive & industrial practice at AlixPartners, a global consulting firm, said the tariffs will present at least a momentary advantage for manufacturers that assemble vehicles in Japan, Korea or Europe, for example.",
      "\"For automakers that don't import from Canada or Mexico, they'll end up with a little bit of an advantage, because they won't be hit with this brand-new tariff,\" he said. \"So for some period of time, vehicles coming in that aren't subject to additional tariffs will have a big advantage over domestic companies, or those that are producing in Canada, Mexico or the U.S.\"",
      "He added, \"It's basically penalizing companies relative to those that are importing vehicles from other places, for now.\"",
      "Ford CEO says tariffs would have \"huge impact\"",
      "In an earnings call with analysts on last month, Ford Motor Company CEO Jim Farley said a prolonged period of higher tariffs would wipe out the company's profits, drive up vehicle prices and slow economic growth.",
      "\"There is no question that tariffs at 25% level from Canada and Mexico, if they're protracted, would have a huge impact on our industry with billions of dollars of industry profits wiped out and adverse effect on the U.S. jobs as well as the entire value system in our industry,\" Farley said. \"Tariffs would also mean higher prices for customers.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, insisted in a\u00a0post on social media that such tariffs would be a \"win\" for American industry by driving \"massive amounts of auto manufacturing\" to Michigan, for one.",

    "summary": "Investors wary of President Trump's plan to add tariffs of 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as a negative GDP forecast.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks fell sharply on Monday after President Trump said he has decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, with Wall Street concerned that the import duties could threaten U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation.",
      "The broad-based S&P 500 index tumbled 105 points, or 1.8%, to 5,850, marking its biggest one-day decline so far this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index shed 2.6%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.5%.",
      "Additionally, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta is forecasting an economic contraction in the first quarter, with gross domestic product projected to\u00a0decline an annualized 2.8% in the current quarter \u2014 a reversal from growth of almost 3% that was forecast as recently as early February.",
      "Economists are sounding alarms about growing economic uncertainty caused by Mr. Trump's tariffs, which could push up prices in the U.S. and undermine the president's pledge to eliminate the inflation that ate into consumers' purchasing power during the Biden administration. At the same time, recent economic data is showing some cracks in the financial health of U.S. households, with consumer confidence dropping in February to its lowest in four years.",
      "\"We expect that inflation in the U.S. will be stoked by between 1.1% and 1.4% from tariffs on Canada and Mexico, with another 0.7% coming from those slapped on China,\" said Nigel Green, CEO of financial advisory firm deVere Group, in an email. \"The economic implications are vast: the price of everyday goods will rise, corporate profits will feel the squeeze and consumers will ultimately foot the bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Americans say their outlook for the next year is mixed, with more people likely to say the economy is getting worse than better, according to CBS News polling. Consumers say they believe the economy and inflation should be Mr. Trump's top issues, but most say they see the president prioritizing other issues, such as downsizing the federal workforce, another CBS News poll found.",
      "The push behind Mr. Trump's tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump views tariffs \u2014 taxes on imports \u2014 as an economic elixir that can restore factories to the American heartland, raise money for the government and pressure foreign countries to do what he wants.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump put tariffs on most Chinese goods and on imported solar panels, washing machines, steel and aluminum. The tax increases might have raised prices on those items, but they had little or no impact on overall inflation, which remained modest. Nor did they do much to restore factory jobs.",
      "Economists agree that a second Trump trade war could be far costlier than the first.",
      "\"That was then. This is now,'' said trade analyst William Reinsch of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, his trade team carefully focused its tariff hit list to avoid or at least delay the impact on consumers. They targeted industrial products and not those \"that would show up on Walmart's shelves,\" said Reinsch, a former U.S. trade official. \"That tamped down the impact.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's latest round of tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession, said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco.",
      "Because U.S. businesses must bear the added costs from tariffs, they largely pass on the costs to American consumers. That, in turn, could weigh on consumer spending at a time when households are still grappling with the fallout from post-pandemic inflation.",
      "The Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through widespread job cuts, could have a ripple effect, curtailing spending by U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Monday that a leading Taiwanese semiconductor chip company plans to invest $100 billion in new manufacturing plants in the U.S.",
      "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductor chips, and plans to make the major investment over the next several years. Mr. Trump made the announcement in the White House Roosevelt Room alongside the company's CEO, C.C. Wei.",
      "\"Today, Taiwan Semiconductor is announcing that they will be investing at least $100 billion in new capital in the United States over the next short period of time to build state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing facilities,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think mostly it's going to be in Arizona which is what I understand, which is a great state. I like it because I won it.\"",
      "The president called TSMC the \"most powerful company in the world,\" and said the economic development announcement is a \"matter of economic security\" and a \"matter of national security for us.\"",
      "The Wall Street Journal was first to report the investment pledge. TSMC was promised $6.6 billion in funding under the Biden-era CHIPS and SCIENCE Act of 2022, and announced plans for its first U.S. plant in Arizona.",
      "The anticipated announcement comes amid Mr. Trump's threats to impose tariffs on semiconductor chip imports, which TSMC could avoid by manufacturing the chips in the U.S. The president has also floated expedited permits for companies that invest at least $1 billion in the U.S. Mr. Trump noted Monday that if Wei's company made the chips in Taiwan and exported them to the U.S., they'd face 25% tariffs.",
      "Speaking at the White House, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick credited the tariffs with the TSMC announcement.",
      "\"Under the Biden administration, TSMC received a $6 billion grant, and that encouraged them to build $65 billion. So America gave TSMC 10% of the money to build here. And now you're seeing the power of Donald Trump's presidency,\" Lutnick said. \"TSMC, the greatest manufacturer of chips in the world, is coming to America with a hundred-billion-dollar investment, and of course that is backed by the fact that they can come here because they can avoid paying tariffs.\"",
      "Semiconductor chips are small but critical components for today's technology, with small pieces of silicone that contain electronic circuits. Semiconductor chips are found in everything from iPhones to cars, and demand has boomed in recent years thanks to the explosion in artificial intelligence, which requires an enormous amount of computing power.",
      "\"Semiconductors are the backbone of the 21st century economy,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"And really, without the semiconductors, there is no economy, powering everything from AI to automobiles to advanced manufacturing.\"",
      "The vast majority of semiconductor chips are manufactured in Asian countries, with Taiwan at the top, and the Trump administration is hoping to draw more manufacturing to the U.S. Both the Biden and Trump administrations have viewed increasing U.S. chip manufacturing a matter of national security.",
      "\"We must be able to build the chips and semiconductors that we need right here in American factories with American skill and American labor,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And that's exactly what we're doing. As you know, Taiwan pretty much has a monopoly on that market.\"",

      "A survey conducted by University of North Carolina Charlotte and other institutions found that more than 90% of employees occasionally experience these \"meeting hangovers,\" with over half reporting that these negative effects hurt their overall workflow and productivity.",
      "\"A meeting hangover is the idea that when we have a bad meeting, we just don't leave it at the door. It sticks with us and it negatively affects our productivity,\" said Steven Rogelberg, a professor at UNC Charlotte and author of \"The Surprising Science of Meetings.\"",
      "The study found that employees often ruminate about bad meetings and feel compelled to share their frustrations with colleagues, creating what Rogelberg terms \"co-rumination\" that can spread negative impacts throughout an organization.",
      "Common factors contributing to negative meeting experiences include unnecessary meetings that could have been emails, irrelevant agenda topics, poor facilitation, too many attendees, excessive length, domination by a few participants, and unclear decisions.",
      "Rogelberg recommends several strategies to prevent meeting hangovers:",
      "\"Keep the attendee list as small as possible,\" Rogelberg said. \"Remember that the more the leader talks, the lower the rating of effectiveness. Thus, the meeting leader needs to talk less and facilitate more.\"",
      "Rather than organizing agendas as topics to be discussed, Rogelberg suggests structuring them as questions to be answered.",
      "\"By framing agenda items as questions, you have a better sense of who really has to be invited to the meeting,\" he said. \"You know when to end the meeting and if the meeting has been successful \u2014 the questions have been answered.\"",
      "This question-based approach creates an engaging challenge that draws people in, he said, adding that \"if you just can't think of any questions, it likely means you don't need to create a meeting.\"",
      "For employees already suffering from meeting hangovers, Rogelberg suggests venting but centering on problem-focused conversations with colleagues.",
      "\"Chatting with your colleague about how to deal with the situation for the future, getting their thoughts, engaging in sense-making where you're trying to understand, taking different perspectives on what just happened \u2014 those types of conversations increase your skills and your resilience when you do have a bad meeting,\" Rogelberg said.",

    "story": [
      "Hollywood has been re-inventing itself for more 100 years. Change is part of the culture. But a pocket-sized \"Sunset Boulevard\"? That's not a close-up!",
      "We visited the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. Built in 1922, it was home of the very first Hollywood premiere, when Douglas Fairbanks debuted \"Robin Hood\" there. It was a big, spectacular night in Tinsel Town. Today, the Egyptian is owned by the world's largest streaming service, Netflix, which spent $70 million to renovate the movie palace.",
      "Why? According to Ted Sarandos, the co-CEO of Netflix, seeing movies in a theater is inspiring. \"I could think back to my first time being in a movie theater watching 'Jaws' at 11 years old. And I remember like it was yesterday \u2013 popcorn went this way, and the soda went this way, and the audience screamed. And that's a very unique and different experience.\"",
      "And an increasingly distant one. Today, screens are smaller, and ticket prices higher. It all leads to a common refrain: \"They don't make 'em like they used to.\"",
      "\"It's probably like everything else; the thing we grew up on is what we want,\" said Sarandos. \"It's oftentimes the art forms move on, and advances in ways that we kind of miss the old version of it. But they do make movies like they used to. And I think they're better than ever.\"",
      "That, of course, is debatable. What's not in doubt is that the big movies are far more predictable than ever. In 2024, the top 15 films at the box office were all franchises, sequels, or reboots.",
      "Sarandos said, \"The business has become very stratified. Either movies are gigantic spectaculars built to make billions of dollars, or they're very small, independent films. And there's not much in the middle anymore.\"",
      "Tom Rothman, who runs Sony's motion picture group, said, \"Movies still do really well, and big movies are still really big, right? But what's missing at the moment, I believe, is a range and a breadth of originality.\"",
      "Rothman, like Sarandos, is among the most powerful people in this business. His films do stream on Netflix, but only after they play in theaters. \"You can have quality or you can have quantity; it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to have both quality and quantity together,\" said Rothman. \"What does streaming have? It has quantity. Okay, so that's a very broad, wide net. And \u2026 it's a very low bar.\"",
      "Nancy Meyers has made films that have earned more than $1.5 billion. She's the writer and director of hit romantic comedies like \"The Holiday,\" \"Something's Gotta Give,\" and \"It's Complicated.\" She believes the shift to, let's call it \"the super-hero formula\" has killed off the types of movies many of us have loved for generations.",
      "\"There is an enormous difference,\" Meyers said. \"I felt in the '90s a freedom to have ideas that people would want to make \u2013 I wasn't worried that they wouldn't be open to the kind of movies that I make.\"",
      "\"Creativity and originality, you saw as an asset?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, I did!\" she laughed. \"Character, wit, comedy, heart, big screen. I had no crystal ball. I couldn't see into the future of how movies were gonna change.\"",
      "The change, says Meyers, means films like \"Chinatown,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" even \"Dirty Dancing\" might not get made today. \"Movies, it's always been a business to make money, always,\" she said. \"But they were less afraid, I think. They were less afraid. They took more chances.\"",
      "Michael Schulman, who writes about movies and culture for The New Yorker, and is author of the book \"Sscar Wars,\" said, \"I would love for the movies to be a little bit less like they used to. Every two seconds there's a new 'Superman,' 'Beetlejuice,' 'Lion King,' 'Alien,' 'Mission: Impossible,' 'Bridget Jones,' 'Indiana Jones.' The goal is to not come up with the next great idea, but to excite the shareholders about a sure bet for the next quarter.\"",
      "Schulman says the movies we grew up on are still out there, produced by the independent studios behind \"Anora\" (Neon), \"The Brutalist\" (A24), and other best picture nominees. Schulman said, \"I often hear people say when the list comes out for the Academy Awards, 'Well, I haven't heard of half of those movies.' \u00a0If you go to the movie theater and they have ten screens showing 'Captain America: Brave New World' and no 'Brutalist,' then there's your problem.\"",
      "Netflix's Sarandos said, \"Even now, the average American goes to the movie theaters twice a year. The average Netflix member watches seven movies a month. So, I feel like that's gotta be good for the business, and it's gotta be good for the art of storytelling to have a platform, and an audience of 700 million people who still watch movies, when they could watch TikTok videos, they could watch YouTube clips, they could be listening to podcasts. But they still watch movies.\"",
      "What Sarandos knows (and what many of us may be trying to avoid admitting) is this:\u00a0 If they don't make movies like they used to, it might be because we don't watch 'em like we used to. \"There's all this opportunity, I think, to get the history of this art form, the history of storytelling, the history of humans, on the screen,\" he said. \"If the screen is gigantic here, or a good-sized at home, or even small on your phone, I don't think it's sacrilege for someone to watch a great movie on their phone. I'd much rather them do that than not watch movies at all.\"",
      "Tom Rothman and Nancy Meyers concede there's value in streaming movies at home. But what they want \u2013 and what they believe the audience wants \u2013 is something cinematic.",
      "\"The movie experience is not on your phone,\" Rothman said. \"A movie experience is a collective, big-screen experience. You're there, you're in the dark.\"",
      "Hollywood, said Meyers, \"used to be called a dream factory, right? And somebody's dream is up on the screen \u2013 somebody's version of a world that you get pulled into and you get sucked into. The lights come up at the end and, you know, you've been somewhere. You've had an experience when we're in a movie theater. That's what a movie is.\"",
      "Watch an extended interview with Nancy Meyers:",
      "I said, \"There are movies being made that meet the standard of bold originality. But there aren't many. And it feels \u2013 and maybe it always felt this at all moments where there was a sea change in Hollywood \u2013 but it feels like the hill is too steep to climb.\"",
      "\"I love that question,\" said Rothman. \"The hill is steep, and the climb is hard. But it is not too steep, and it is not too hard, if you're tough and bold enough, right? And if it were easy, anybody could do it. And it's not easy. And you have to be willing to risk, and you have to be willing to fail.\"",
      "His advice? \"Tighten up your boots and climb.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure,\u00a0rose\u00a02.5% in January on an annual basis, matching economists' expectations and providing some reassurance on the heels of hotter-than-expected inflation data earlier this month.",
      "The PCE index and other inflation yardsticks, such as the Consumer Price Index, measure the change in prices over time of a typical basket of goods and services.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The January numbers match forecasts that the PCE rose 2.5% on an annual basis, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "While inflation has plunged from its recent peak of about 9% in June 2022, it still remains higher than the Fed's goal of driving it to an annual rate of 2%. Today's PCE data follows on the heels of the most recent CPI report, which showed that inflation accelerated in January to 3% on an annual basis.",
      "What economists say",
      "The PCE report shows that inflation \"rose at a mild pace in January, which offers some relief after a string of economic reports suggesting that inflation is heating up again,\" said Key Wealth managing director of fixed income investments Rajeev Sharma in an email.",
      "The recent sticky CPI report had reinforced the Fed's decision in January to\u00a0pause\u00a0on additional rate cuts, but today's data suggests that the central bank could still introduce more reductions this year. That said, \"thoughts of multiple rate cuts for 2025 may be overly optimistic based on today's data,\" Sharma added.",
      "Many consumers are also expressing their concerns about stubborn inflation, with a large majority of Americans telling CBS News polling that their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation. Some are expressing concern about their ability to save or buy extras, the poll found.",
      "Consumer sentiment is souring amid stubborn inflation and other headwinds, according to some recent measures. \"The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for Democratic-leaning consumers plunged to the lowest since the economic collapse of 2008 in February,\" noted Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in an email.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 17:41:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump officials remain on course to hit Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs on March 4, with a wave of other levies ready to roll.",
    "story": [
      "Experts are expressing concern that steep new U.S. tariffs primed to take effect on March 4, along with planned levies on other trading partners, could fan inflation and slow the nation's growth \u2014 an economic malaise known as \"stagflation.\"",
      "President Trump on Thursday said on social media that 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, which had been delayed for a month while the sides negotiated, will now roll out\u00a0next week as scheduled. He also this week announced an additional 10% tariff on imports from China, on top of those already in place, set to kick in next week, while\u00a025% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are lined up for March 12. Sweeping reciprocal tariffs and levies on\u00a0automobile imports\u00a0may be deployed as soon as early April, while Mr. Trump has threatened to hit imports from the European Union with 25% duties.",
      "Mounting uncertainty about the scale and potential impact of such tariffs, including the \"somewhat abrupt and arbitrary way\" in which they've been announced, risks throttling spending by consumers and businesses, said Marcus Noland, director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a nonpartisan research firm.",
      "\"Normally I'd say tariffs alone would damage the economy, but won't send the U.S. into recession,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What gives me pause about that now is the unsettling way that that the administration is going about its business and general confusion about tariffs. It's not so much the actual tariffs but confusion about them that's causing an increase in uncertainty and is really pushing down investment.\"",
      "EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco said the Trump tariffs, \"if pushed to their extreme,\" could even trigger a recession. U.S. businesses would bear the added costs from taxes on imports and mostly pass them along to American consumers, which would weigh on spending.",
      "A recent survey from EY-Parthenon found that 50% of business executives said they would pass on two-thirds or more of any increased costs they incur from tariffs to consumers.",
      "\"In a world where your imports cost 25% more, or even 10% more, there is going to be a notable impact on prices and inflation,\" Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That will lead to demand destruction, so if the administration presses too hard on the tariff front there is a negative effect on our import prices and on inflation.\"",
      "Fears of a trade war are raising concerns among businesses and consumers, he added. U.S. consumer confidence plunged in February in what was the biggest monthly decline in more than four years, a sign that growing uncertainty over Mr. Trump's policies is taking a toll, the Conference Board said this week.",
      "\"They are fearful of incoming inflation so if anything, the policies put in place have the tendency to be inflationary, and there is not only a risk of a recession, but stagnation,\" Daco said, referring to the periods intense economic distress in the 1970s marked by stagnant economic growth and high inflation.",
      "U.S. consumer spending fell in January compared to the previous month, dropping for the first time in nearly two years, according to data from the Commerce Department. The 0.5% slump was partly attributed to weather, but was also \"another illustration that President Trump's tariff threats are not sitting well with households,\" analysts with Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "Another potential drag on the economy, according to economists: the Trump administration's push to shrink the U.S. government, including through mass job cuts. That will have a spillover effect and could limit spending at U.S. businesses.",
      "\"Federal workers all support jobs in the local economy by spending on Uber drivers, at restaurants, sporting events and barber shops,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So there will be some negative effects elsewhere in the economy.\"",

    "summary": "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\"one Social Security Administration employee said of the agency's plans to slash its workforce.",
    "story": [
      "Social Security Administration workers are warning that the Trump administration's plan to significantly shrink the agency could cause chaos and hinder their ability to provide service to the millions of retirees, disabled people and other Americans who rely on the program.",
      "The SSA's restructuring comes after President Trump vowed on the campaign trail not to touch the old-age and disability insurance program, which provides monthly financial payments to almost 70 million people, or about 1 in 5 Americans. At the same time, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla who is serving as a close adviser to the president, are vowing to cut what they say is fraud and abuse across federal agencies through the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "But current Social Security employees caution that cutting the already strained Social Security workforce could impact beneficiaries in numerous ways, such as longer waits to qualify for disability benefits and for assistance on customer service issues.",
      "\"We are already short-staffed as it is,\" said one current Social Security Administration employee, an attorney who works on disability applications and who spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern that speaking publicly could jeopardize his job at the agency.",
      "\"Right now we are working on applications generally from 2023-ish,\" he noted. But, he added, a significant workforce reduction could mean that \"easily the wait times will be extended by one year.\"",
      "Each year, thousands of people awaiting disability decisions die before they receive their benefits, with former Social Security Administration Commissioner Martin O'Malley telling Nextgov/FCW in 2024 that about 30,000 people died while awaiting their determinations during fiscal 2023.",
      "Most workers qualify for Social Security disability coverage through their payroll taxes, which provides a backstop in case you get injured and aren't able to continue working, the Social Security worker noted. But cutting agency staff likely means it could become even more difficult for many disabled workers to get their benefits approved, he added.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Cuts come amid boomers turning \"peak 65\"",
      "The SSA on Thursday sent an email to all employees stating that the agency would soon undergo a restructuring, including \"significant workforce reductions.\" On Friday, the agency said it plans to trim staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers.",
      "The agency is also offering financial incentives ranging as high as $25,000 to some employees who choose to voluntarily resign.",
      "The agency's workforce cuts come as the ranks of Americans receiving Social Security benefits have swelled to an all-time high, largely due to the aging baby boomer population. An average of about 11,000 boomers are set to turn 65 each day this year through 2027, according to a\u00a0report\u00a0from the Alliance for Lifetime Income.",
      "That demographic change, called \"peak 65,\" is causing major economic and societal changes, with Social Security on the receiving end. Since 2014, the number of retired workers and their dependents receiving Social Security payments has surged by almost 30%, reaching 54 million people as of last year, according to agency data.",
      "At the same time, the number of full-time workers at the Social Security Administration has declined almost 10% from about 63,000 employees in 2014 to about 57,000 workers in 2022, agency data\u00a0shows.",
      "Even before these pending cuts, some recipients were struggling with service issues at the Social Security Administration, Nancy Altman, the president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've got wait times, you have phone calls that get dropped, you get put on hold for hours \u2014 and this will make it so much worse,\" she said.",
      "Long wait times for callers seeking help from the Social Security Administration's workforce was identified as a trouble spot in the agency's most recent\u00a0annual performance report. Its goal: To shave an average 34-minute on-hold wait time to 12 minutes, although the agency said it was evaluating that \"aspirational goal\" as it was unable to hire additional workers last year.",
      "Workers taking buyouts",
      "Some Social Security employees are already opting for the buyouts, which could lead to a brain drain at the administration, another agency employee told CBS MoneyWatch. The employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his job safety, noted that several people in his group told him they planned to accept buyout offers.",
      "Because Social Security workers with 25 years of experience are eligible for the buyouts, the agency will lose some of its most experienced workers, he added.",
      "\"You are going to see a slowdown in everything,\" he said.",
      "Morale at the agency is at \"an all-time low,\" a third Social Security employee said, who spoke on condition of anonymity as she is still employed at the agency.",
      "Employees were also distressed by Acting Social Security Commissioner Lee Dudek's response to Elon Musk's demand that workers detail five recent work accomplishments. In an email sent to staff, Dudek singled out firing probationary workers as one of his personal achievements. \"It left a very bad taste in our mouths,\" the employee said.",
      "Many agency workers receive modest salaries, the third Social Security worker added. All the Social Security employees who spoke with CBS MoneyWatch said they were drawn to the agency because they wanted to help people.",
      "About 80% of Social Security workers earn somewhere between Grades 5 to 12 on the federal general schedule pay scale, which includes a starting pay range between about $33,000 to $74,000 a year, agency data shows.",
      "Americans fund the Social Security Administration's services through their payroll taxes, or FICA contributions, noted Rich Couture, the spokesman for the Social Security General Committee of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\"The public paid for access to services with their FICA contributions,\" Couture said. \"We're at a 50-year staffing low in the midst of a customer service crisis \u2014 now is the time for us to invest in Social Security with proper staffing to make further improvements.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:45:27 -0500",
    "summary": "The man who launched the Economic Blackout said he is \"trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians,  to stand for the people.\"",
    "story": [
      "After years of railing against corporate greed on social media, John Schwarz had an idea that suddenly caught fire: an \"economic blackout\" aimed at resisting what he maintains is an alliance between corporations and politicians to rig the system against ordinary Americans.",
      "The 57-year-old Chicago resident, founder of the People's Union USA, the fledgling advocacy group leading the campaign, expresses surprise at suddenly finding himself and his movement in the spotlight. Yet while he initially found the attention overwhelming, Schwarz said that in other ways it's a moment he's been preparing for all of his life.",
      "\"I've been online for 10 years trying to do this in kind of a nice way, not really speaking as bluntly on specific topics,\" Schwarz told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And then after that, I said, no, this is great because this is exactly what I wanted to do. And I just dove in head first and we're not stopping.\"",
      "Schwartz, a father of three and meditation teacher, said the idea for a blackout came to him while recording the latest in a series of videos posted on social media in which he presents himself as a common man who is also president of the United States.",
      "\"When I was into about the third or fourth one of those, I said even a president should be calling for an economic blackout and to unionize citizens. And when I kind of said that, it sparked that idea in me. And I said, you know what, as a matter of fact let's do this. Let's do an economic blackout \u2014 get a bunch of people together for one day, if they want to take part and start something, and try to work on unionizing the people.\"",
      "Over the past month, word has spread quickly of the Feb. 28 Economic Blackout, which urges Americans to refrain from spending any money at any major retailer for 24 hours. The People's Union says it is apolitical and that its call for a boycott \u2014 communicated by punchy posts on Instagram and TikTok set to music, as well by text an email \u2014 is meant to fire a shot across the bow of corporate giants from Amazon to McDonald's.",
      "\"Mega corporations have driven up prices, underpaid their workers and outsourced jobs while raking in record profits,\" the group said on its website. \"Banks and financial institutions have trapped generations in debt, inflating interest rates and making homeownership nearly impossible. Politicians 'both left and right' have accepted corporate bribes, passed laws that serve billionaires and ignored the needs of the people they claim to represent.\"",
      "Schwarz said he grew up in the 1970s and '80s \"in the projects,\" referring to the subsidized housing where he was raised in Queens, New York. He describes that neighborhood as a melting pot of Jewish, Black, Polish, Russian and other families.",
      "\"We didn't walk around going, 'Oh, you're white, you're black, you're Russian.' It was just, we were all from the neighborhood,\" he said. \"I think there's a way to kind of get to that feeling with everyone in this country, because we're so divided today. We're more divided today on more subjects than any other time in history.\"",
      "Schwarz underlines that the goal of reunifying Americans is fundamental to him and the People's Union. His idols include Muhammad Ali, Martin Luther King Jr., social activist Abbie Hoffman, and politician and civil rights leader Harvey Milk, individuals he said he admires for dedicating their lives to speaking out 'for the people.' \"",
      "What does the People's Union USA stand for?",
      "Schwarz founded the People's Union USA only in February, and as a grassroots organization the group is still in the process of setting up its structure and registering as a legal entity. To cover the costs, Schwarz has set up a GoFundMe page with the goal of raising $100,000, and as of Friday has raised more than $90,000.",
      "Schwarz sees the blackout as a way for Americans to use their economic might in the form of their purchasing power to fight corporate greed and corrupt politicians.",
      "\"What we're doing here is trying to cause economic resistance, against the corporations and politicians, to stand for the people. I think people may be able to at some point begin to kind of realize those things they're letting divide us don't really exist,\" he said.",
      "Another goal for The People's Union is abolishing federal income\u00a0taxes for average Americans, which Schwarz said can be achieved by requiring large businesses to pay \"their fair share.\"",
      "Added Schwarz, \"And even, you know, the administration is just putting their foot in their mouth with wanting to do, you know, gold card visas for $5 million. So they're talking about bringing in more money, all the more reason we shouldn't have to pay federal taxes.\"",
      "Schwarz also favors imposing a government cap on corporate profits. \"Companies need to prove what their expenses are in comparison to their profits. And there has to be a reasonable cap.\"",
      "More broadly, Schwarz underlines the importance of Americans gaining a measure of freedom from an economic system that he believes normalizes financial struggle and traps people in a perpetual cycle of debt.",
      "What's the point of the boycotts?",
      "Schwarz doesn't expect the Economic Blackout to change things for the better overnight but he does think it will send corporations a message.",
      "\"We want companies to bend the knee \u2014 we've been kissing the ring our entire lives. It's time to turn that around,\" he said, adding \"We're the consumers. We are the economy. Without us, they're nothing.\"",
      "Schwarz said messages of support for the Economic Blackout have also been pouring in from people outside of the U.S. \"It's gone international, from Australia to Spain. Every country has messaged me, people from all over the world commenting on the videos. 'How can we stand in solidarity?'\"",
      "\"I just started telling them, you too, in your country, don't buy anything that day,\" he added.",
      "The Feb. 28 blackout began at 12 a.m. EST Friday and is scheduled to go on until 11:59 p.m. the same day. For the boycott, the People's Union is asking participants to refrain from making purchases, which includes avoiding fast food or filling their gas tanks. It adds that shoppers with emergencies or in need of essentials should support local small businesses and try not to use a credit or debit card.",
      "The group plans to hold a second broad-based economic blackout on March 28, but it's also organizing targeted boycotts against specific retailers \u2014 Walmart and Amazon \u2014 as well as global food giants Nestle and General Mills. For the boycott against Amazon, the organization is encouraging people to refrain from buying anything from Whole Foods, which the e-commerce company owns.",

      "Microsoft in late 2012\u00a0scrapped its own instant-messaging\u00a0tool, Messenger, after buying Skype the prior year. But in the more than decade since, services including FaceTime, Messenger and WhatsApp have let people connect in ways that made it difficult for Skype to compete.",
      "The difficulties were illustrated in particular during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic that saw people\u00a0stuck at home flocking to Zoom. Microsoft launched Teams for consumers in 2020, while saying at the time it remained committed to Skype.",
      "Skype was launched in 2003 by entrepreneurs Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, with the company's name combining \"Sky\" with a reference to peer-to-peer networks, the technology that during the dotcom boom became an important new way for sharing online files and data.",
      "The company's founders first sold Skype to eBay in 2005 for $2.6 billion. Microsoft's acquisition in May of 2011, at the time the biggest ever purchase for the software maker, gave it access to a user base of about 170 million people who logged in to Skype each month. That count morphed to more than 300 million monthly users by 2016, but had shriveled to 36 million in 2023, Microsoft said.",
      "Those now using Skype will have time to log in to the Microsoft Teams app and have their message history, group chats and contacts available without having to create an additional account, according to Microsoft. Users can also opt to export their data to another app.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from drastically cutting medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and cost jobs.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries.",
      "Separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide sued to stop the cuts, saying they would cause \"irreparable harm.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston had temporarily blocked the cuts last month. Wednesday, she filed a preliminary injunction that puts the cuts on hold for longer while the suits proceed.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded about $35 billion in grants to research groups last year. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers' salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \"indirect\" costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \"overhead,\" but universities and hospitals argue they're far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Under prior policy, the government negotiated those rates with institutions. As an example, an institution with a 50% indirect cost rate would get another $50,000 to cover indirect expenses for a $100,000 project. The NIH's new policy would cap indirect costs at a flat rate of 15% instead, calculated to save the agency $4 billion a year.",
      "Current and former\u00a0health\u00a0officials previously told CBS News they were shocked by the change, and stressed federal authorities already carefully scrutinize and negotiate down how much funding goes to indirect costs.",

    "summary": "House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with just 10 days left to head off a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday on social media, calling the continuing resolution \"very important.\"",
      "\"Let's get this Bill done!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "But Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, met with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. After the meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert said they're ready to move forward with a continuing resolution, called a CR for short, so that the president's agenda can move forward. But other caucus members said they need to see the text first.",
      "\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris. \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.",
      "In recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.",
      "But Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"",
      "Without support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.",
      "During the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.",
      "Amid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.",
      "Even if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.",
      "\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.",
      "Caitlin Yilek, \n                                                  \n                      Kristin Brown and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Ratcliffe acknowledged the halt in intelligence sharing Wednesday morning during an interview on Fox Business.",
      "Ratcliffe said the pause is \"on the military front and the intelligence front,\" but he did not elaborate further on the scope of the pause.",
      "Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 White House visit was intended to be capped by the signing of a landmark agreement granting the U.S. hundreds of billions in potential benefits from mining Ukraine's minerals agreement. The signing was abruptly scrapped after the meeting descended into finger pointing over Russia and its unprovoked invasion of the country, and whether Zelenskyy had properly thanked the American president.",
      "Zelenskyy had previously repeatedly thanked Mr. Trump and the U.S., and continued to do so afterward. Mr. Trump's top advisers privately shared disbelief about what they viewed as Zelenskyy's badgering of the president in front of cameras.",
      "Zelenskyy has since said he's ready to get back to the negotiating table.",
      "Ratcliffe said in the interview that Mr. Trump made the decision to halt intelligence sharing.",
      "The president \"said 'let's pause.' I want to give you a chance to think about that, and you saw the response, that President Zelenskyy put out a statement saying 'I'm ready for peace, and I want Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Ratcliffe later added that the U.S. still intends to work with Ukraine in its ongoing conflict with Russia.",
      "\"We'll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine, as we have to push back on the aggression that's there,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "The Trump administration earlier in the week paused military aid to Ukraine. Although a senior official told CBS News Wednesday that U.S. weapons authorized by former President Biden were still headed toward Ukraine, U.S. European Command appeared to contradict that assertion.",
      "\"We can confirm that U.S. European Command has received an order to pause security assistance to the Armed Forces of Ukraine,\" U.S. European Command said in a statement. \"U.S. European Command has paused the delivery of those items previously announced as part of Presidential Drawdown Authority packages. Those PDA materials that were in transit have also been paused until further guidance is issued.\"",
      "\"Any materiel paused in theater has been, or will be, moved to secure facilities in accordance with applicable host nation agreements.,\" European Command said.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday night during his\u00a0congressional address that he is \"working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "Intelligence sharing has been crucial for Ukraine in its efforts to strike Russian military targets.",
      "Mr. Trump's confrontational approach with American allies has drawn withering criticism from Democrats, including Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, who delivered a response Tuesday to Mr. Trump's address.",
      "\"President Trump loves to say 'peace through strength.' That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\" Slotkin said, implying the president who led the U.S. through most of the late-Cold War 1980s would be more supportive of Russia's adversaries than Mr. Trump is.",

      "The probe, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, will look into whether UC \"engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination based on race, religion and national origin against its professors, staff and other employees by allowing an Antisemitic hostile work environment to exist on its campuses,\" the DOJ statement said.",
      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza, student encampments popped up on a number of college campuses across the country \u2014 including at UCLA and other UC system campuses. Many of the protesters were calling for an end to the war, a U.S. arms embargo on Israel and for their universities to divest from Israel. But in some instances, acts of antisemitism were alleged, and some Jewish students said the encampments and encounters with protesters made them feel unsafe.",

      "The protests on UCLA's campus last year made national headlines when a group of counter-protesters \"came to Royce Quad and violently attacked students, faculty, and staff members who were engaged in an encampment at that location,\" UCLA said at the time. The clash lasted several hours into the night, with video posted to social media showing fireworks and tear gas being launched into the encampment.",

      "Washington\u2014Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that President Trump hopes to build the entire wall along the southern border by the time his term concludes, an ambitious goal that Mr. Trump was unable to realize in his first term.",
      "Vance made the comments as he, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a day trip to the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, to highlight the Trump administration's efforts to combat illegal crossings and drug trafficking. Their visit comes a day following Mr. Trump's\u00a0joint address to Congress, in which immigration played a prominent role.",
      "Illegal border crossings at the U.S. southern border\u00a0have plummeted\u00a0since Mr. Trump took office, but the president's recent speeches feature fewer mentions of building a physical border wall than they did during his 2016 campaign and first term.",
      "\"I think the president's hope is that by the end of the term we build the entire border wall,\" Vance said. \"And of course that's the physical structure, the border wall itself, but we even heard today, there are so many good technological tools. So many great artificial intelligence-enabled technologies that allow us, for example \u2014 a camera, not a person, but a camera picks up somebody two miles away who's about to come across the southern border. ... We're using artificial intelligence to make us better at the job of border enforcement, but we've got to make sure that technology is deployed across the entire American southern border. We're going to do it as much as we can, as broadly as we can, because that's how we're going to protect the American people's security.\"",
      "Vance and Hegseth represent the highest-ranking administration officials to visit the southern border since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "They arrived one day after the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all imported goods from Mexico, citing Mexico's handling of the situation at the border, a move that sent\u00a0stocks tumbling. A reporter asked Vance what Mexico can do to reverse the tariffs.",
      "\"Well what the president says is we need a sustained commitment from the government of Mexico to take the job of border security seriously,\" Vance responded. \"Fentanyl is the single-largest cause of death among young Americans, and we know that a substantial portion of it is \u2014 the precursors are made in China, they come to Mexico, they're manufactured in Mexico, and brought across the border by the Mexican drug cartels. We want to see fewer Americans dying of these terrible fentanyl overdoses. We're going to apply as much leverage as possible to the Mexican government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has seen success in its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. In February, Mr. Trump's first full month in office, the White House says illegal border crossings reached the lowest level in at least 25 years. And the administration says more than 50,000 people in the country illegally have been removed from the U.S., a figure that includes migrants with violent criminal histories.",

But two U.S. officials tell CBS News there are currently no Department of Defense flights scheduled to take undocumented migrants to Guantanamo or to other foreign countries.

    "summary": "Automakers will get a one-month reprieve from 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",

      "As part of his government-cutting initiative, Mr. Trump offered the entire federal workforce, which consists of more than 2 million people, a deferred resignation program, under which they could resign from their jobs but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "Thousands of probationary employees, generally considered those who have been in their positions for less than a year, have also been terminated. The Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads in a Jan. 20 memo to identify all employees in their probationary periods and determine whether they should be kept on.",
      "But after a federal judge ruled last week that the mass firings were likely illegal, OPM revised the memo to clarify that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "The VA dismissed more than 2,400 employees last month and said there were more than 40,000 probationary workers across the department.",

      "Dellinger's lawyers say allowing the president to fire the special counsel without cause would have a chilling effect on the important duties of the office to protect whistleblowers. The ruling comes as Dellinger is also challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's shakeup of the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the law protecting the special counsel from removal is unconstitutional and unfairly prevents the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",

      "That inflationary period was above 9% for around two years, and above the target 2% rate for nearly a decade. Under Biden, inflation was elevated for about two years as well, but at lower levels. Inflation stands at 3% as of January 2025.",

      "Read the full text of his prepared remarks:",
      "Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.",
      "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. Never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.",
      "Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.",
      "And what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.",
      "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?",
      "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.",
      "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.",
      "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.",
      "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.",
      "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.",
      "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.",
      "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.",
      "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.",
      "What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.",
      "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.",
      "That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.",
      "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.",
      "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.",
      "Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.",
      "This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.",
      "And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.",
      "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.",
      "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.",
      "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.",
      "With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.",
      "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.",
      "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.",
      "Because we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.",
      "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.",
      "And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.",
      "But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.",
      "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.",
      "They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.",
      "Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.",
      "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.",
      "A new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.",
      "The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.",
      "And I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.",
      "They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.",
      "Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.",
      "Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
      "And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.",
      "But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.",
      "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.",
      "Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.",
      "Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.",
      "Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.",
      "The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.",
      "Alexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.",
      "With us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.",
      "The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.",
      "I have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.",
      "And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.",
      "Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.",
      "They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.",
      "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.",
      "One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.",
      "Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.",
      "I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.",
      "I'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.",
      "Joining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.",
      "D.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.",
      "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can't even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.",
      "My administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.",
      "Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.",
      "Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.",
      "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.",
      "And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.",
      "We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that's good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",

      "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.",
      "We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.",
      "To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it.",
      "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.",
      "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.",
      "They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.",
      "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.",
      "But he's already proven \u2014 I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.",
      "And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.",
      "We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.",
      "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.",
      "It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land and very, very important for military security.",
      "America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism.",
      "Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",
      "Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity. And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.",
      "And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.",
      "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.",
      "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.",
      "In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations: the Abraham Accords. And now we're going to build on that foundation, to create a more peaceful and prosperous future for the entire region.",
      "A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. People haven't been talking about that so much lately, with everything going on with Ukraine and Russia, a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. A rough neighborhood actually.",
      "I'm also working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine. Millions of Ukrainians and Russians have been needlessly killed or wounded in this horrific and brutal conflict, with no end in sight.",
      "The United States has sent hundreds of billions of dollars to support Ukraine's defense, with no security, with no way. Do you want to keep it going for another five years? Yeah, yeah, you would say, \"Pocahontas says yes.\"",
      "2000 people are being killed every single week. More than that. They are Russian young people. They're Ukrainian young people. They're not Americans. But I want it to stop.",
      "Meanwhile, Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they have spent on defending Ukraine by far. Think of that. They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.",
      "And we've spent perhaps $350 billion. Like taking candy from a baby. That's what happened. And they've spent $100 billion. What a difference that is. And we have an ocean separating us. And they don't. But we're getting along very well with them. And lots of good things are happening.",
      "Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars. It's hard to believe that they wouldn't have stopped it and said at some point, come on, let's equalize. You got to be equal to us. That didn't happen.",
      "Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelenskyy of Ukraine. The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"",
      "I appreciate that he sent this letter, just got it a little while ago. Simultaneously, we've had serious discussion with Russia and have received strong signals that they are ready for peace.",
      "Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful? Wouldn't that be beautiful?",
      "It's time to stop this madness. It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end this senseless war.",
      "If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.",
      "Nearly four years ago, amid rising tensions, a history teacher named Mark Fogel was detained in Russia and sentenced to 14 years at a penal colony. Rough stuff. The previous administration barely lifted a finger to help him. They knew he was innocent, but they had no idea where to begin.",
      "But last summer, I promised his 95-year-old mother, Malphine, that we would bring her boy safely back home. After 22 days in office, I did just that. And they are here tonight.",
      "To Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.",
      "As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.",
      "That was not pleasant. And that is where I met his beautiful mom right before I walked onto that stage. And I told her I would not forget what she said about her son. And I never did that, did I? Never forgot.",
      "Less than 10 minutes later, at that same rally, gunfire rang out and a sick and deranged assassin unloaded eight bullets from his sniper's perch into a crowd of many thousands of people.",
      "My life was saved by a fraction of an inch, but some were not so lucky. Corey Comperatore was a firefighter, a veteran, a Christian, a husband, a devoted father, and above all, a protector. When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.",
      "To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot. It was love like Corey's that built our country and it's love like Corey's that is going to make our country more majestic than ever before.",
      "I believe that my life was saved that day in Butler for a very good reason. I was saved by God to make America great again. I believe that. Thank you very much.",
      "From the patriots of Lexington and Concord, to the heroes of Gettysburg and Normandy, from the warriors who crossed the Delaware, to the trailblazers who climbed the Rockies, and from the legends who soared at Kitty Hawk, to the astronauts who touched the moon, Americans have always been the people who defied all odds, transcended all dangers, made the most extraordinary sacrifices, and did whatever it took to defend our children, our country, and our freedom.",
      "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.",
      "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.",
      "Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.",
      "We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.",
      "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.",

    "summary": "Read the full text of Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin's prepared remarks for her 2025 Democratic response to Trump's speech to Congress, as released.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin in her brief Democratic response to President Trump's joint address to Congress warned that Mr. Trump, in the his first few weeks of his second presidential term, has taken \"reckless\" approaches to managing the U.S. economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Here's the full text of her remarks, which ran just 10 minutes, compared to Mr. Trump's speech, which was an hour and 40 minutes long:",
      "Hi everyone. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight. It's late \u2014 so I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched.",
      "I won't take it personally if you've never heard of me. I'm the new senator from the great state of Michigan, where I grew up. I've been in public service my entire life, because I happened to be in New York City on 9/11 when the twin towers came down. Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted a life in national security.",
      "I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military. In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional.",
      "You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States \u2013 places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better.",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.",
      "We just went through another fraught election season. Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change. But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.",
      "So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight.",
      "Because whether you're in Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs: That the Middle Class is the engine of our country. That strong national security protects us from harm. And that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for.",
      "Let's start with the economy.",
      "Michigan literally invented the Middle Class: the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. That's the American Dream. And in order to expand and protect the Middle Class, we have to do a few, basic things:",
      "We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.",
      "We need to make more things in America with good-paying, union jobs \u2014 and bring our supply chains back home from places like China.",
      "We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future.",
      "And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars.",
      "Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead?",
      "Not even close.",
      "President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.",
      "Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2014 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either.",
      "His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, cars \u2014 and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.",
      "Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.",
      "Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.",
      "And one more thing: In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement \u2013 the Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. The President claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your bank accounts? No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails on what they do with your private data.",
      "We need more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe.",
      "The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing, and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer \u2014 only to re-hire them two days later? No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired.",
      "OK, so we've talked about our economic security. How about national security?",
      "Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that.",
      "But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy, that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the President's plan on that.",
      "Because here's the thing: Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism \u2014 one nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners \u2014 and our safety depends on it.",
      "President Trump loves to promise \"peace through strength.\" That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity.",
      "And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.",
      "As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.",
      "Donald Trump's actions suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we are an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world.",
      "Look, America's not perfect. But I stand with most Americans who believe we are still exceptional. Unparalleled. And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week.",
      "Because for generations, America has offered something better.",
      "Our security and our prosperity, yes. But our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. And right now, it's at risk.",
      "It's at risk when a president decides he can pick and choose what rules he wants to follow, when he ignores court orders or the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand idly by and just let it happen.",
      "But it's also at risk when the President pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different, and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.",
      "Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are.",
      "We are a nation of strivers. Risk-takers. Innovators. And we are never satisfied.",
      "That is America's superpower.",
      "And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night.",
      "So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving.",
      "But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question.",
      "First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for democracy, where would we be today?",
      "Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie.",
      "Three, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can't find one, start one.",
      "Some of the most important movements in our history have come from the bottom up.",
      "In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the next decade.",
      "But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before. And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.",
      "But every single time, we've only gotten through those moments because of two things: Engaged citizens and principled leaders.",
      "Engaged citizens who do a little bit more than they're used to doing to fight for the things they care about. And principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it.",
      "So thank you tonight for caring about your country. Just by watching, you qualify as engaged citizens. And I promise that I, and my fellow Democrats, will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that you deserve.",
      "Goodnight everyone.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday declined to halt a lower court order that required the Trump administration to unfreeze nearly $2 billion in foreign-aid funding, clearing the way for the money to flow to groups that have done work for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development overseas.",
      "The decision from the high court ends a pause Chief Justice John Roberts issued last week to allow the high court time to more fully consider a request from the Trump administration to intervene in the ongoing court battle over a 90-day pause on foreign assistance funds.",
      "The chief justice issued a brief administrative last Wednesday \u2014 with a midnight deadline for foreign aid payments approaching \u2014 before the full court acted on President Trump's bid for emergency relief.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in denying the request from the Trump administration, with Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett joining with the three liberal justices. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh dissented from the denial.",
      "\"Does a single district-court judge who likely lacks jurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the government of the United States to pay out (and probably lose forever) 2 billion taxpayer dollars?\" Alito wrote in a dissent joined by the three other conservative justices. \"The answer to that question should be an emphatic 'No,' but a majority of this Court apparently thinks otherwise. I am stunned.\"",
      "Proceedings in the case are ongoing, and the district court is set to hold a hearing on the contractors' request for longer relief Thursday.",
      "Pointing to those ongoing hearings, the court said that the \"district court should clarify what obligations the government must fulfill to ensure compliance with the temporary restraining order, with due regard for the feasibility of any compliance timelines.\"",
      "The order is among the first the Supreme Court issued as dozens of legal challenges to the president's policies move through the federal courts. The high court has been asked to intervene in one other case so far, arising out of Mr. Trump's removal of the head of the federal agency that oversees whistleblowers. It put off the president's request to allow him to fire that official, special counsel Hampton Dellinger, amid ongoing legal proceedings and has not yet weighed in further.",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The Trump administration came to the high court for emergency relief last week after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ordered the government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests to USAID and State Department contractors for work finished before Feb. 13.",
      "Ali is overseeing a challenge to Mr. Trump's 90-day pause on foreign assistance brought by a group of nonprofits and businesses that receive foreign aid funding and argue the freeze is an unconstitutional exercise of presidential power. Last month, he temporarily barred the administration from halting the foreign-assistance funding. Then, after State Department and USAID contractors said last week that they were still not receiving money they were owed, Ali issued an order requiring the Trump administration to comply with his earlier Feb. 13 directive and pay all invoices and funding requests on contracts, grants and other agreements for work finished before that date.",
      "The judge required the government to pay the contractors by 11:59 p.m. on Feb. 26.",
      "The Justice Department appealed Ali's order to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, but it declined to intervene after finding that order could not be appealed.",
      "In seeking emergency relief from the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris asked the court to first temporarily halt the district court's order \u2014 pausing last Wednesday night's deadline for the administration to unfreeze foreign aid funds \u2014 and then toss it out altogether.",
      "Harris said that Ali's order was not limited to payments to the nonprofits and companies that brought the case, but was more broad and required it to pay nearly $2 billion on thousands of payment requests.",
      "\"This new order requiring payment of enormous sums of foreign-assistance money in less than 36 hours intrudes on the prerogatives of the Executive Branch,\" she wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"The president's power is at its apex \u2014 and the power of the judiciary is at its nadir \u2014 in matters of foreign affairs.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general said the district court's order prevents the executive branch from not only \"ensuring that foreign-aid payments are consistent with the president's policy priorities, but from conducting even basic diligence to ensure that payments are free from fraud and abuse.\"",
      "Harris reiterated that in seeking emergency relief, the Trump administration wanted to ensure agencies were not at risk of violating a federal court order requiring the foreign aid payments. But restarting the funding required multiple stages and multiple agencies, she said, making compliance with Ali's deadline effectively impossible.",
      "\"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" she said.",
      "But lawyers for the company and nonprofits urged the Supreme Court to deny Mr. Trump's request, in part because it lacks jurisdiction to review a district court order that directed the government to comply with its temporary measure.",
      "\"The government's application, in this posture, amounts to a request for license to continue defying\" a temporary restraining order that requires it to administer USAID and State Department programs established under the law, they argued.",
      "The lawyers said in a filing that Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 executive order and subsequent State Department and USAID memoranda halting foreign aid and ordering contractors to stop work \"plunged\" the organizations into \"financial turmoil\" and forced them to layoff employees. Some are even facing civil and regulatory actions for employment violations, evictions, insolvency and \"physical threats to personnel in conflict areas,\" the lawyers wrote in the Supreme Court filing.",
      "\"Respondents' work advances U.S. interests abroad and improves \u2014 and, in many cases, literally saves \u2014 the lives of millions of people across the globe. In doing so, it helps stop problems like disease and instability overseas before they reach our shores,\" the nonprofits wrote. \"The government's actions have largely brought this work to a halt. With Americans out of work, businesses ruined, food rotting, and critical medical care withheld, the public interest weighs heavily against the government. These are the fruits of the government's actions.\"",
      "They also noted that since Feb. 13, when the district court issued the initial order, the Trump administration \"never once voiced concerns about the feasibility of compliance.\"",
      "In his dissent, Alito wrote that because of the Supreme Court's order, the government must pay the $2 billion at issue \"not because the law requires it, but simply because a district judge so ordered.\"",
      "\"As the nation's highest court, we have a duty to ensure that the power entrusted to federal judges by the Constitution is not abused,\" he wrote. \"Today, the court fails to carry out that responsibility.\"",
      "Alito also took issue with the scope of relief granted by the district court, which required the federal government to pay all invoices and reimbursement requests on all contracts for work completed before the temporary restraining order was put in place.",
      "The lower court, he wrote, \"offered no reason why universal relief to nonparties is appropriate here.\"",
      "\"Today, the court makes a most unfortunate misstep that rewards an act of judicial hubris and imposes a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers,\" Alito wrote. He added that while the nonprofit organizations and businesses challenging the funding freeze raise \"serious concerns about nonpayment for completed work,\" the relief ordered by the district court is \"too extreme a response.\"",
      "\"A federal court has many tools to address a party's supposed nonfeasance,\" Alito said. \"Self-aggrandizement of its jurisdiction is not one of them.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Al Green, a Texas Democrat, was escorted from the chamber Tuesday night for shouting during President Trump's 2025 address to a joint session of Congress.",
    "story": [
      "Rep. Al Green, a Democrat from Texas, was swiftly escorted from the House chamber Tuesday night after interrupting President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "Green, a 77-year-old congressman, was ejected for shouting early on during Mr. Trump's speech, in which the president reviewed his administration's sweeping legislative agenda and outlined, for an hour and 40 minutes, his vision for how Congress should start to implement it.",
      "How long has Al Green been in Congress?",
      "Green has represented Texas' 9th congressional district, which includes Houston, since 2005. He is currently serving his 11th term in the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "His\u00a0congressional biography\u00a0touts him as \"a veteran civil rights advocate\" who \"has fought for those in society whose voices, too often, are not heard.\"",
      "Green was among the federal lawmakers who pushed to remove Mr. Trump from office during his last term, introducing the first articles of impeachment against him in 2017 and threatening to do it again when the president suggested a U.S. takeover of Gaza last month.",
      "He was arrested in 2012 outside of the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C., where he and other lawmakers at the time protested the civil war policies of Sudan's then-president, and again in 2021, outside of the U.S. Capitol while protesting a voting rights bill.",
      "Green is the assistant whip for House Democrats. Since his election to Congress, he has become a member of both the Congressional Asian American Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus, a show of \"his commitment to serving the communities he represents,\" his biography says.",
      "The congressman also serves on the House Financial Services Committee, focusing on diversity and inclusion, housing, community development and insurance, as well as the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Oversight and Reform.",
      "Why was Al Green removed during Trump's speech?",
      "After Mr. trump touted his victory in the 2024 election, Green stood up from his seat, raised his cane in Mr. Trump's direction and could be heard shouting \u2014 in a departure from the largely quiet protests of his Democratic peers.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, who sat behind the president during his address, immediately banged a gavel and said \"members are directed to uphold and maintain decorum in the House and to cease any further disruptions,\" in a response to Greene. \"That's your warning,\" Johnson said. Green continued as Johnson told him to sit down. The House Speaker ultimately instructed the sergeant at arms to \"restore order\" and remove Green from the chamber.",
      "Green later told reporters he was \"willing to suffer whatever punishment is available to me.\"",
      "\"I'm not fighting the punishment,\" Green said. \"This is about the people who are being punished by virtue of losing their health care. This is the richest country in the world, and we have people who don't have good health care. We've got to do better and now we're about to cut Medicaid, which is for poor.\"",
      "Where is Al Green from?",
      "Green was born in New Orleans in September 1947. He attended Florida A&M University, Howard University and the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. \"Without receiving an undergraduate degree, he enrolled in the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctorate in 1973,\" his bio states.",
      "He went on to co-found and co-manage a law firm and was appointed Justice of the Peace in Harris County, Texas, where he served for 26 years before serving in the House. Green also served for a decade as president of the Houston branch of the NAACP prior to joining Congress, according to his bio.",

The final sample of post-speech re-interviews was weighted to be representative of those who said they would watch the President's address according to gender, age, race, education, geographic region, 2024 Presidential vote, and pre-speech partisan identification.

    "summary": "Sen. Elissa Slotkin was elected by a narrow margin in November to represent Michigan after serving several terms in the House.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin delivered the Democratic response to President Trump's\u00a0address to a joint session of Congress\u00a0Tuesday night, and warned that the first weeks of his new administration have brought \"reckless\" approaches to the economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Slotkin spoke for roughly 10 minutes in front of a backdrop of American flags\u00a0following Mr. Trump's nearly two-hour, often campaign-style speech.",
      "What did Slotkin say in her response to Trump's speech?",
      "\"America wants change, but there's a responsible way to make change and a reckless way,\" Slotkin said.",
      "Slotkin pointed to perhaps the most well-known member of Mr. Trump's team, Elon Musk. The world's richest person was lauded by the president for leading the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a newly-branded agency tasked with dramatically shrinking the size of the federal government.",
      "\"In order to pay for his plan, he may very well come after your Social Security,\" Slotkin said, referring to a comment Musk made recently calling the popular program a \"Ponzi scheme.\"",
      "Slotkin said the president should be focused on bringing \"down the price of things,\" listing groceries, housing and health care.",
      "\"The president talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So do his plans actually help Americans get ahead? Not even close,\" Slotkin said, before recounting a claim frequently made about Trump's relationship with Musk and other ultra-wealthy supporters. \"President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America.\"",
      "She accused President Trump of levying tariffs that will ultimately lead to steeper prices for Americans,",
      "\"His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, and cars and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers,\" Slotkin said. \"Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.\"",
      "Trump said earlier Tuesday that \"tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country.\"",
      "Slotkin, a former CIA officer, also harshly rebuked Mr. Trump's approach to foreign policy, honing in on the\u00a0televised argument last week between Mr. Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"President Trump loves to say peace through strength. That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling in his grave,\" Slotkin said, implying Reagan would be more supportive of an adversary to Russia than Mr. Trump has been to Ukraine.",
      "Mr. Trump said during his address that he is \"working tirelessly to end the savage conflict in Ukraine.\"",
      "Who is Elissa Slotkin?",
      "Slotkin was elected to the Senate in November. She previously represented Michigan in the House since 2019.",
      "The 48-year-old worked in national security roles in both the Bush and Obama administrations.",
      "Why did the Democrats choose Slotkin to deliver their response?",
      "As Slotkin noted in her speech, she and Mr. Trump both won in Michigan during November's election.",
      "While serving in the House, she had a reputation for working across the aisle, and promised on the campaign trail to continue her bipartisan efforts in the Senate.",
      "Slotkin cited her bipartisan credentials, nodding to the \"shared values\" in her upbringing, which\u00a0she said \"were bigger than any one party.\"",
      "Slotkin urged Americans not to \"tune out,\" saying \"America needs you more than ever.\"",
      "She said voters must hold elected officials accountable by going to town halls, organizing and taking action.",
      "Slotkin said it's not \"the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country.\" Slotkin later added that the nation has only survived those moments because of \"engaged citizens and principled leaders.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has signaled it will move in court to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban\u200b, a dramatic reversal from the Biden administration's stand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration signaled Tuesday it will move to let Idaho enforce its strict abortion ban, even in the treatment of pregnant women suffering medical emergencies, a dramatic reversal from the previous administration in a closely watched lawsuit.",
      "The state's largest hospital system said it could be forced to airlift women out of state for care if the federal lawsuit is dismissed. That persuaded a judge to quickly grant a temporary order allowing doctors to keep providing abortions they deem necessary to treat emergencies.",
      "The move to dismiss the lawsuit originally filed by the Biden administration could come as soon as Wednesday, St. Luke's Health System wrote in a court filing, citing communication with the Justice Department.",
      "Dropping the case would be among the new administration's first major moves on abortion. In his first term, President Trump appointed many of the Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn the nationwide right to abortion in 2022. He has since said the issue should be left to the states.",
      "Complaints that pregnant women were turned away from U.S. emergency rooms spiked after the overturning of Roe v. Wade amid questions about what care hospitals could legally provide, federal records showed.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "History of legal battle over Idaho abortion ban",
      "In its original lawsuit against Idaho, the Biden administration argued that federal law required doctors to perform abortions in emergency situations if a patient's health or life were at serious risk - even if ending the pregnancy could run afoul of the state's abortion ban, one of the country's most restrictive.",
      "Idaho has pushed back, saying that its state law allows for abortions in life-threatening situations and that the Democratic administration was trying to improperly expand its exceptions.",
      "The Supreme Court stepped into the Idaho case last year and ultimately handed down a narrow ruling that allowed hospitals to keep making determinations about emergency pregnancy terminations.",
      "The high court did not, however, resolve key legal questions in the case, and it was argued before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in December. The appeals court hasn't ruled yet.",
      "Idaho Deputy Attorney General Brian Church had urged the court to reject St. Luke's request for a restraining order, saying the hospital system was trying to reinterpret federal law and wrest control from the state legislature now that, \"the United States is abandoning its erroneous interpretation\" that federal law requires emergency abortions.",
      "\"It is now seeking to usurp the role of the Idaho Legislature in setting statewide medical standards of care,\" Church wrote. He said any changes to state policy should come from the ballot box, not the courts.",
      "When might emergency abortions be performed?",
      "About 50,000 people in the U.S. develop life-threatening pregnancy complications each year, including major blood loss, sepsis or the loss of reproductive organs. In rare cases, doctors might need to terminate a pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant person, especially in cases where there is no chance for a fetus to survive.",
      "When Idaho was able to fully enforce its ban during medical emergencies, some Idaho doctors reported that pregnant women were facing delays in care and in some cases being flown to out-of-state hospitals for treatment they would have previously been able to get at home.",
      "\"My colleagues and I lived in constant fear that patients would present in an emergency room who were not stable enough to transfer, yet the medically indicated stabilizing care-termination-could not be provided because it was not yet needed to prevent the patient's death,\" one doctor said in court documents.",
      "While the law does allow for life-saving abortions, it's still impossible to tell exactly when a dire case crosses the line to potentially fatal in the eyes of the law, she wrote.",
      "In another abortion-related case this week, the Trump administration received additional time to make a filing - which would also give it time to change the government's position on the issue. In that case, the states of Idaho, Kansas and Missouri are seeking to restrict the abortion pill mifepristone. Under Mr. Biden, the government was defending access.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have started enforcing new bans or restrictions since 2022. Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy - often before women realize they're pregnant.",

      "Have other Democrats protested during Trump's speech?",
      "Green's interruption came after questions swirled about how Democrats would conduct themselves during Mr. Trump's address. A group of House Democratic women wore pink Tuesday night to protest how they say the president's policies are \"devastating women,\" while other lawmakers held up signs or otherwise displayed their discontent.",
      "Other Democrats conducted acts of protests, with four House Democratic women taking off their pink blazers, stood up, and turned around to reveal black tee shirts with wording on the back \u2014 at least one of them said \"RESIST.\" They then walked out of the chamber.",
      "Several other members also walked out of the chamber.",
      "Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, meanwhile, displayed a white board that said \"start by paying your taxes\" when Mr. Trump asked Congress to extend his 2017 tax cuts, which are set to sunset at the end of 2025.",
      "Another Democrat, Rep. Melanie Stansbury of New Mexico, held a sign that said \"this is not normal\" while Mr. Trump walked out. Republican Rep. Lance Gooden of Texas then snatched it out of her hands and threw the paper into the air. Gooden posted on social media afterward \"No one will disrespect President @realdonaldtrump in front of me.\"",
      "During his speech, Mr. Trump addressed some of the Democrats who protested, saying \"I look at the Democrats in front of me and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do.\"",
      "\"I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history, or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded,\" Mr. Trump said. \"And these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what. Five times I've been up here, it's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.\"",
      "A small number of Democrats opted not to attend Tuesday night's address, including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Patty Murray of Washington and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. But Democrats didn't stage a large-scale boycott of the speech.",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:47:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Extinction is still forever, but scientists at the biotech company Colossal Biosciences are trying what they say is the next best thing to restoring ancient beasts\u00a0\u2014 genetically engineering living animals with qualities to resemble extinct species like the woolly mammoth.",
      "Woolly mammoths roamed the frozen tundras of Europe, Asia and North America until they went extinct around 4,000 years ago.",
      "Colossal made a splash in 2021 when it unveiled an ambitious plan to revive the woolly mammoth and later the dodo bird. Just last year, the company said they made a breakthrough in efforts to bring back the extinct Tasmanian tiger.",
      "Colossal has focused on identifying key traits of extinct animals by studying ancient DNA, with a goal to genetically \"engineer them into living animals,\" said CEO Ben Lamm.",
      "In a 2023 interview, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti told Lamm, \"I hear mammoth and dodo in the same sentence and, you know, it's science fiction to me.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I mean, it is,\" said Lamm, \"until it's not.\"",
      "Outside scientists have mixed views about whether this strategy will be helpful for conservation.",
      "\"You're not actually resurrecting anything \u2014 you're not bringing back the ancient past,\" said Christopher Preston, a wildlife and environment expert at the University of Montana, who was not involved in the research.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal announced that its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair. They nicknamed the extra-furry rodents as the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "Results were posted online, but they have not yet been published in a journal or vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The feat \"is technologically pretty cool,\" said Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University of Buffalo, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Scientists have been genetically engineering mice since the 1970s, but new technologies like CRISPR \"make it a lot more efficient and easier,\" said Lynch.",
      "The Colossal scientists reviewed DNA databases of mouse genes to identify genes related to hair texture and fat metabolism. Each of these genetic variations are \"present already in some living mice,\" said Colossal's chief scientist Beth Shapiro, but \"we put them all together in a single mouse.\"",
      "They picked the two traits because these mutations are likely related to cold tolerance \u2014 a quality that woolly mammoths must have had to survive on the prehistoric Arctic steppe.",
      "Independent experts skeptical of \"de-extinction\"",
      "Colossal said it focused on mice first to confirm if the process works before potentially moving on to edit the embryos of Asian elephants, the closest living relatives to woolly mammoths.",
      "However, because Asian elephants are an endangered species, there will be \"a lot of processes and red tape\" before any plan can move forward, said Colossal's Lamm, whose company has raised over $400 million in funding.",
      "\"We are in the world of synthetic biology. These tools exist. It's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. We need to be really thoughtful about the intended and unintended consequences of our actions,\" Lamm told CBS News Boston in 2022.",
      "Independent experts are skeptical about the idea of \"de-extinction.\"",
      "\"You might be able to alter the hair pattern of an Asian elephant or adapt it to the cold, but it's not bringing back a woolly mammoth. It's changing an Asian elephant,\" said University of Montana's Preston.",
      "Still, the refinement of precision gene-editing in animals could have other uses for conservation or animal agriculture, said Bhanu Telugu, who studies animal biotechnology at the University of Missouri and was not involved in the new research.",
      "Telugu said he was impressed by Colossal's technology advances that enabled scientists to pinpoint which genes to target.",
      "The same approach might one day help fight diseases in people, said Lamm. So far, the company has spun off two health care companies.",
      "\"It's part of how we monetize our business,\" said Lamm.",
      "Ben Mezrich, who authored the book, \"Woolly: The True Story of the Quest to Revive One of History's Most Iconic Extinct Creatures,\" told CBS News in 2017 that reviving woolly mammoths could potentially facilitate medical breakthroughs.",
      "\"I mean, elephants don't get cancer, which is very strange,\" he told CBS News. \"Elephants have thousands and thousands of more cells than us. And why they don't get cancer is in their genes. If we can figure that out, we can use this genetic engineering to solve cancer.\"",

The company said it partnered with NASA using a technique known as Schlieren photography to visualize what can't be seen with the naked eye.",
      "\"This image makes the invisible visible,\" Boom Supersonic founder and CEO Blake Scholl said in a news release.",
      "Chief test pilot Tristan \"Geppetto\" Brandenburg had to make sure XB-1 was in the right place at the right time to allow NASA's team on the ground to photograph it in-flight as it eclipsed the sun, the Colorado-based company said. Crews used telescopes with special filters that can detect air distortions like shock waves to capture the image.",
      "The photo was taken during the XB-1's 13th overall test flight, according to the company, but it was the second time it flew at supersonic speed, this time reaching Mach 1.18, or 772 mph, Boom Supersonic said.",
      "Scholl said that the XB-1 didn't make an audible sonic boom that typically occurs when an aircraft is flying faster than the speed of sound. The captured data suggests that, at certain speed and atmospheric conditions, the sonic boom refracts in the atmosphere and never reaches the ground. The finding may lead the way for supersonic commercial flights without sonic booms, the company said in its news release.",

But NASA managers disagreed and eventually decided to bring the Starliner back to Earth by remote control, without its crew, in early September.",
      "To minimize the disruption to the station's crew rotation schedule and on-going research, NASA opted to bump two astronauts from the next SpaceX Crew Dragon flight and to launch that mission, known as Crew 9, in late September with just two crew members on board. That left two empty seats for Wilmore and Williams.",
      "The Crew 9 mission was initially expected to end this month, but the flight was extended to late March because of issues preparing a new Crew Dragon for launch, sources said. NASA later decided to use a different Crew Dragon, clearing the way for Crew 9 to undock and head for Earth around March 19.",
      "On Jan. 28, President Trump blamed the Biden administration for the Starliner crew's extended stay in space, saying he had asked SpaceX founder Elon Musk to \"go get\" the two \"brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden administration.\"",
      "\"They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Hours before the president's post, Musk said on his social media platform X that Mr. Trump had asked SpaceX to get the Starliner astronauts home as soon as possible, adding, \"We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.\"",
      "Musk later said he offered to bring Wilmore and Williams back to Earth earlier, but he said his offer was turned down because \"they did not want positive press for someone who supported Trump. That's it. End of story.\"",
      "Wilmore described the SpaceX CEO as \"absolutely factual.\" But he added that the crew had no knowledge of such an offer.",
      "\"We have no information on that, though ... what was offered, what was not offered, who it was offered to, how that processes went,\" Wilmore told a reporter Tuesday. \"That's information that we simply don't have.\"",
      "\"So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe you would be hoping for.\"",
      "NASA plans to operate the ISS through 2030. In another recent post on X, Musk said the station should be brought down earlier: \"It is time to begin preparations for deorbiting the @Space_Station. It has served its purpose. There is very little incremental utility. Let's go to Mars.\"",
      "When asked by tech and science news outlet Ars Technica to clarify, Musk responded on X by saying \"the decision is up to the president, but my recommendation is as soon as possible. I recommend 2 years from now.\"",
      "Williams said he disagreed.",
      "\"This place is ticking, it's just really amazing,\" she said of the station. \"So I would say we're actually in our prime right now. We've got all the power, all of the facilities up and operating. So I would think that right now is probably not the right time to call it quits.\"",

    "summary": "The Blue Ghost touchdown kicks off two weeks of around-the-clock research by NASA science and technology payloads.",
    "story": [
      "Firefly Aerospace's \"Blue Ghost\" lander dropped out of lunar orbit and swooped to a rocket-powered touchdown early Sunday, pulling off the first fully successful moon landing by a commercially-built and operated robotic spacecraft.",
      "Flying above the far side of the moon in a circular 62-mile-high orbit, the squat lander fired its main engine at 2:31 a.m. EST, kicking off a white-knuckle 63-minute descent to the landing site in Mare Crisium \u2014 the Sea of Crises \u2014 in the northeast quadrant of the moon as viewed from Earth.",
      "The 6.6-foot-tall lander coasted for the next 52 minutes before using its main engine and eight smaller reaction control system, or RCS, thrusters to reduce its velocity from about 3,800 mph to just 90 mph as it moved into position above the landing site.",
      "After autonomously analyzing the terrain below for boulders, slopes, and other hazards, Blue Ghost descended using the power of its eight reaction control system jets. The jets pulsed as needed to control velocity and orientation before slowing the craft to just 2.2 mph for the last 30 feet or so of the descent.",
      "Firefly Aerospace employees and family members, known collectively as \"Fireflies,\" watched telemetry stream in on a large monitor near the company's Austin, Texas, headquarters and mission control center, no doubt on the edges of their seats as the 11.5-foot-wide spacecraft neared the surface.",
      "\"Eleven meters up,\" a flight controller said on the Firefly mission control audio loop. A moment later, the thrusters shut down and surface contact sensors on Blue Ghost's shock-absorbing landing legs indicated they were on the lunar surface.",
      "\"Engine shutdown confirmed,\" a flight controller verified.",
      "\"Power is nominal, vehicle is charging (with its solar cells),\" someone else chimed in.",
      "\"IMU (inertial measurement unit) reports lunar gravity, and it is stable,\" another controller reported, prompting the start of applause from onlookers.",
      "Will Coogan, the chief engineer, then came on the line with the official results: \"You all stuck the landing! We're on the moon!\"",
      "The assembled Fireflies instantly burst into cheers, hugs and raucous applause. A few minutes later, \"Make Space Great Again\" hats were handed out.",
      "\"Firefly successfully touched down on the moon in an upright, stable condition, becoming the first commercial company to complete a fully successful moon landing,\" said Brigette Oakes, Firefly vice president of engineering.",
      "Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin said in a post on the social media platform X: \"'Contact light, engine stop!' Congratulations FireFly Aerospace for Blue Ghost's Mission 1 successful Moon landing today! It also marks a new milestone in the collaborations between NASA and private Space companies.\"",
      "Launched on Jan. 15, the landing was timed to coincide with the start of a two-week-long lunar day. The solar-powered Blue Ghost will operate 10 NASA-sponsored experiments while sunlight is available and, if all goes well, for a few hours into the lunar night using stored battery power. After that, it will fall silent.",
      "\"Once in a blue-moon long-time ago, these type of lunar landers took billions of dollars and countries behind (them) to land on the moon,\" Firefly CEO Jason Kim told CBS News in a pre-launch interview.",
      "\"This is Firefly Aerospace that's gonna land on the moon at fractions of the cost on a fixed-price contract, and doing it with the latest commercial technology,\" he said. \"Just like Simone Biles stuck the landing in the Olympics, we're gonna do the same thing for the state of Texas, for America and for the world.\"",
      "For Ray Allensworth, spacecraft program director at Firefly, the moon will never look the same.",
      "\"We were all dreaming up until now that you look up at the (moon) and you just imagine, like, that's where it's gonna be,\" she said. \"But now, you know it's there, and that's a totally different feeling. So, yeah, the next full moon, I just won't sleep. I'll just stare at it all night.\"",
      "NASA agreed to pay Firefly Aerospace $101 million to carry 10 agency-sponsored science instruments and technology demonstrations, built for $44 million, to the moon as part of the agency's Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.",
      "The CLPS program aims to encourage private industry to launch agency payloads to the moon to collect needed science and engineering data before Artemis astronauts begin work on the surface near the lunar south pole later this decade.",
      "\"Before we can send our humans back to the moon, we are sending a lot of science and a lot of technology ahead of time to prepare for that,\" said Nicky Fox, director of space science at NASA Headquarters.",
      "\"We learned so many lessons during the Apollo era, and the technological and science demonstrations on board Firefly's Blue Ghost will be critical in our ability to not only discover more science, but also to ensure the safety of our spacecraft instruments, and, most importantly, the safety of our astronauts.\"",
      "Firefly's instruments include three designed to study how landing thrusters disturb the lunar soil, how fine-grained dust particles adhere to spacecraft surfaces and whether electrodynamic techniques for removing accumulated contamination will work in the lunar environment.",
      "A drill will bore into the surface below the Blue Ghost to measure soil temperatures at different depths while a novel sample collection system will attempt to literally blow surface particles into a capture device, foregoing the need for robot arm-type retrieval systems.",
      "A radiation-tolerant computer will be tested, another instrument will attempt to pull in and process GPS navigation satellite data from Earth, a retroreflector will serve as a positioning target for Earth-based lasers and another instrument will take X-ray images showing interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field.",
      "Along with its initial Blue Ghost mission, Firefly holds a $130 million CLPS contract for a second flight in 2026, this one to the moon's far side featuring a Blue Ghost lander and an orbital spacecraft called Elytra. Another CLPS contract valued at $179 million is helping pay for a Blue Ghost lander, a rover and another orbiter.",
      "\"One of these days, we're going to get there in terms of the commercial aspects of the moon,\" Kim said. \"There's going to be a lot of business plans that are going to be self-sustaining and growing. It's a great location to frequently go and test out new missions to sustain life in space, and it's a stepping stone for Mars as well.\"",
      "Blue Ghost is the first of three commercially-developed landers, all launched within the last month and a half, to reach the lunar surface.",
      "Sharing a ride to space with Blue Ghost aboard the same SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket last January was another moon lander, a spacecraft called \"Resilience\" that was built by Tokyo-based ispace. The company sent its first lander to the moon last year, but it crashed to the surface after running out of fuel due to a software glitch.",
      "The appropriately-named Resilience took a different route to the moon than Blue Ghost, a low-energy trajectory utilizing lunar gravity to help reach the desired descent orbit for a landing attempt in May.",
      "Yet another lunar lander, built by Houston-based Intuitive Machines and known as Athena, was launched last Wednesday by another Falcon 9 and is expected to touch down on the moon March 6. The company's first lander, Odysseus, successfully landed on the moon last year, but it tipped over on touchdown and was unable to complete all its planned research.",
      "Athena also was funded in large part by NASA's CLPS program, which agreed to pay the company $62.5 million to carry a sophisticated drill and mass spectrometer to the moon.",
      "NASA awarded a $15 million technology \"tipping point\" contract to Nokia to test cellular communications on the moon and another $41 million to Intuitive Machines for a small rocket-powered \"hopper\" that will jump into a permanently shadowed crater in search of ice deposits.",

      "While Europol said Operation Cumberland targeted a platform and people sharing content fully created using AI, there has also been a worrying proliferation of AI-manipulated \"deepfake\" imagery online, which often uses images of real people, including children, and can have devastating impacts on their lives.",

The manipulated content has proliferated on the internet as lawmakers in the U.S. and elsewhere race to catch up with new legislation to address the problem.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from drastically cutting medical research funding that many scientists say will endanger patients and cost jobs.",
      "The new National Institutes of Health policy would strip research groups of hundreds of millions of dollars to cover so-called indirect expenses of studying Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease and a host of other illnesses \u2014 anything from clinical trials of new treatments to basic lab research that is the foundation for discoveries.",
      "Separate lawsuits filed by a group of 22 states plus organizations representing universities, hospitals and research institutions nationwide sued to stop the cuts, saying they would cause \"irreparable harm.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston had temporarily blocked the cuts last month. Wednesday, she filed a preliminary injunction that puts the cuts on hold for longer while the suits proceed.",
      "The NIH, the main funder of biomedical research, awarded about $35 billion in grants to research groups last year. The total is divided into \"direct\" costs \u2013 covering researchers' salaries and laboratory supplies \u2013 and \"indirect\" costs, the administrative and facility costs needed to support that work.",
      "The Trump administration had dismissed those expenses as \"overhead,\" but universities and hospitals argue they're far more critical. They can include such things as electricity to operate sophisticated machinery, hazardous waste disposal, staff who ensure researchers follow safety rules and janitorial workers.",
      "Under prior policy, the government negotiated those rates with institutions. As an example, an institution with a 50% indirect cost rate would get another $50,000 to cover indirect expenses for a $100,000 project. The NIH's new policy would cap indirect costs at a flat rate of 15% instead, calculated to save the agency $4 billion a year.",

    "summary": "House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, with just 10 days left to head off a shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans are pursuing a stopgap measure to keep the government funded through September, looking to shore up support for the continuing resolution with less than 10 days to prevent a government shutdown.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson has outlined plans for the measure, which is expected to extend funding at current levels through the end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30, and has the backing of President Trump.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill,\" Mr. Trump said Wednesday on social media, calling the continuing resolution \"very important.\"",
      "\"Let's get this Bill done!\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "But Republicans are facing pressure to do so without support from Democrats. And whether Johnson can get the measure through the House, with a razor-thin Republican majority, remains to be seen.",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, who often oppose the temporary funding measures, met with the president at the White House Wednesday as Republicans move forward with the funding plan, which could be voted on early next week. After the meeting, Rep. Lauren Boebert said they're ready to move forward with a continuing resolution, called a CR for short, so that the president's agenda can move forward. But other caucus members said they need to see the text first.",
      "\"Look, we haven't seen the final form of the CR,\" said Rep. Andy Harris. \"In concept, the president has said he needs this for his agenda. We support the president's agenda.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he's hoping to release the text of the continuing resolution by the end of the week.",
      "In recent years, funding the government has created a headache for Johnson and his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, because of the narrow GOP majority in the House and opposition to temporary funding measures by a group of conservative hardliners. The dynamic has repeatedly forced Republicans to rely on Democrats to keep the government funded, fueling frustration among members of the House GOP ranks.",
      "But Democrats, now in the minority in both chambers and with few opportunities for leverage, are in a different position. As the Trump administration works to dramatically and quickly downsize large swaths of the executive branch, Democrats have been seeking guardrails on Mr. Trump's ability to withhold funding approved by Congress and are intent on including language in the funding measure. Without the guardrails, Democrats argue that the stopgap measure would give the administration more opportunities to cut federal programs.",
      "Johnson told reporters Tuesday that he thinks what Democrats are requesting is \"unconstitutional,\" saying \"this should be a conversation about numbers, and not about limiting the other branch of government.\"",
      "Without support from Democrats, House Republicans must keep their conference in line to approve the stopgap measure. Johnson has touted the approach in recent days, which he billed as one that would keep the government open while House Republicans work to incorporate savings from the DOGE effort and revenue brought in by Trump administration policies. He noted on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that the DOGE cuts wouldn't be included in the forthcoming continuing resolution, while promising a \"very different process\" on next year's funding.",
      "During the last funding fight in December, Johnson pushed for an extension until March to set Republicans up to reach an agreement on new spending bills with a GOP trifecta in Washington. And he noted at the time that House Republicans were aiming to resolve the government funding fight earlier in the year, before the March 14 deadline. But the existing dynamics have persisted, even with Republican majorities in both chambers.",
      "Amid the standoff and approaching deadline, Republicans and Democrats have begun blaming each other. While Republicans say Democrats are flirting with a shutdown with their demands, Democrats argue that the GOP majorities would be responsible for any possible shutdown, and they claim Republicans have left the negotiating table.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democratic appropriator in the Senate, said Tuesday that she's urging Republican leadership to work on new, full-year funding bills and prevent a shutdown with a shorter continuing resolution. She stressed that Democrats \"cannot stand by and accept\" what she called a \"power grab CR that would help Elon take a chainsaw to programs that families rely on.\"",
      "\"I'm ready to pass a short-term CR immediately to take down the risk of a shutdown so that we can finish our negotiations and write our full-year spending bills, which is our job to do,\" Murray added.",
      "Even if House Republicans can approve the six-month funding measure along party lines, a 60-vote threshold in the Senate means the measure would require the backing of at least seven Democrats to be approved in the upper chamber. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, however, who has said \"Republicans are responsible for funding the government,\" called for collaboration on a solution.",
      "\"We believe, we've always believed, the only solution is a bipartisan solution,\" Schumer said.",
      "Caitlin Yilek, \n                                                  \n                      Kristin Brown and \n                                                  \n                      Jaala Brown\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel and Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza, student encampments popped up on a number of college campuses across the country \u2014 including at UCLA and other UC system campuses.

      "Vance made the comments as he, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard made a day trip to the border town of Eagle Pass, Texas, to highlight the Trump administration's efforts to combat illegal crossings and drug trafficking. Their visit comes a day following Mr. Trump's\u00a0joint address to Congress, in which immigration played a prominent role.",
      "Illegal border crossings at the U.S. southern border\u00a0have plummeted\u00a0since Mr. Trump took office, but the president's recent speeches feature fewer mentions of building a physical border wall than they did during his 2016 campaign and first term.",
      "\"I think the president's hope is that by the end of the term we build the entire border wall,\" Vance said. \"And of course that's the physical structure, the border wall itself, but we even heard today, there are so many good technological tools. So many great artificial intelligence-enabled technologies that allow us, for example \u2014 a camera, not a person, but a camera picks up somebody two miles away who's about to come across the southern border. ... We're using artificial intelligence to make us better at the job of border enforcement, but we've got to make sure that technology is deployed across the entire American southern border. We're going to do it as much as we can, as broadly as we can, because that's how we're going to protect the American people's security.\"",
      "Vance and Hegseth represent the highest-ranking administration officials to visit the southern border since Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "They arrived one day after the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all imported goods from Mexico, citing Mexico's handling of the situation at the border, a move that sent\u00a0stocks tumbling. A reporter asked Vance what Mexico can do to reverse the tariffs.",
      "\"Well what the president says is we need a sustained commitment from the government of Mexico to take the job of border security seriously,\" Vance responded. \"Fentanyl is the single-largest cause of death among young Americans, and we know that a substantial portion of it is \u2014 the precursors are made in China, they come to Mexico, they're manufactured in Mexico, and brought across the border by the Mexican drug cartels. We want to see fewer Americans dying of these terrible fentanyl overdoses. We're going to apply as much leverage as possible to the Mexican government.\"",
      "The Trump administration has seen success in its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration. In February, Mr. Trump's first full month in office, the White House says illegal border crossings reached the lowest level in at least 25 years. And the administration says more than 50,000 people in the country illegally have been removed from the U.S., a figure that includes migrants with violent criminal histories.",

    "summary": "Automakers will get a one-month reprieve from 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is giving a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of tariffs that took effect on March 4, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday.",
      "The announcement comes after Mr. Trump spoke with leaders of the so-called Big Three automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep and Ram \u2014 on Wednesday, Leavitt said.",
      "Mr. Trump's imposition of 25% tariffs on all\u00a0goods imported\u00a0from Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional tariff of 10% on Chinese imports, were expected to hit the auto industry hard\u00a0because many vehicle parts and components are imported from those countries to manufacture cars in the U.S.",
      "\"We spoke with the Big Three auto dealers,\" Trump said in a statement read by his spokesperson. \"We are going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA,\" referencing the North American free trade agreement he renegotiated in his first term.",
      "\"Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA,\" Ford said in a statement. \"We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing.\"",
      "In its own statement on the tariff delay, GM said the automaker \"has more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker,\" adding that \"we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain and U.S. jobs.\"",
      "The goal of the tariff pause is to give U.S. automakers time to shift their supply chains to within the U.S., Leavitt said. Mr. Trump \"told them they should get on it, start investing, start moving, shift production here to the U.S. of America, where they will pay no tariffs. That's the ultimate goal,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has said the tariffs are aimed at curbing the flow of migrants and drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S., as well as redressing trade imbalances with other countries. The taxes quickly triggered retaliatory measures by Canada and China, with Mexico planning to announce its response on Sunday.",
      "The new tariffs Canada and Mexico could drive up car costs by as much as $12,200 for some models, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group (AEG), a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "The broad-based tariffs are likely to fuel higher costs on multiple types of vehicles, including SUVs, small cars and electric vehicles, according to AEG's analysis. Higher sticker prices would hit the auto market even as the typical car now costs\u00a0close to a near-record high of $50,000, and would likely add more financial strain on inflation-weary consumers",
      "Shares of U.S. automakers jumped on Wednesday afternoon, with Ford Motor rising 47 cents, or 5.1%, to $9.58. GM shares gained about 7%, while Stellantis climbed 9.2%.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to slash thousands of employees in the coming months as part of President Trump's initiative to scale back the size of the federal government, according to a memo from the agency's chief of staff.",
      "The memo, sent Tuesday to top Veterans Affairs officials and obtained by CBS News, describes the agency's plans for a reduction-in-force, which is expected to take place in August. The department's goal is to return its workforce to 2019-levels of just under 400,000 employees, a cut of more than 70,000 workers.",
      "Led by Secretary Doug Collins, a former congressman and Iraq War veteran, the VA employed more than 471,000 people as of December, according to the agency's\u00a0workforce dashboard, 27% of whom are veterans.",
      "When CBS News asked who would be laid off, whether probationary workers, doctors, administrative staff or some veterans, the White House said the president \"refuses to accept the VA bureaucracy and bloat that has hindered Veterans' ability to receive timely and quality care.\"",
      "\"By making the VA workforce more efficient, President Trump and Secretary Collins will ensure greater efficiency and transparency for our nation's heroes while preserving the benefits they earned,\" deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement.",
      "Collins said in a video\u00a0posted to social media that the VA is taking a \"pragmatic and disciplined approach to eliminating waste and bureaucracy, increasing efficiency and improving health care, benefits and services to veterans.\"",
      "\"This will be a thorough and thoughtful review based on input from career VA employees, senior executives as well as the top VA leaders,\" he said.",
      "Collins said the cuts to the VA's workforce represent a 15% decrease but pledged there will not be cuts to health care or benefits. The department continues to hire for more than 300,000 \"mission-critical\" positions to protect health care and benefits for VA beneficiaries, he said.",
      "\"The days of kicking the can down the road and measuring VA's progress by how much money it spends and how many people it employs rather than how many veterans it helps are over,\" Collins said.",
      "Tuesday's memo states that the Department of Veterans Affairs, \"in partnership with DOGE leaders, will move out aggressively, while taking a pragmatic and disciplined approach to identify and eliminate waste, reduce management and bureaucracy, reduce footprint and increase workforce efficiency.\"",
      "Mr. Trump created the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, which he said is headed by Elon Musk, to oversee his plan to shrink the size of the federal government and cut spending.",
      "The VA's memo estimates that a portion of the savings stemming from its cuts \"will be reinvested in the veterans we serve and the systems required to support our workforce and executive our mission.\"",
      "The memo is part of the VA's efforts to initiate a department-wide review of its organization and structure in response to an executive order Mr. Trump signed last month that directed agency heads to \"promptly\" make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions in its workforce.",
      "\"This effort will require the entirety of VA staff and organizations to work together in a collaborative fashion, as well as to coordinate actions with DOGE and the administration as a whole, to achieve the desired results,\" the directive states.",
      "It lays out a timeline for implementing this reduction-in-force and reorganization plan, which begins this month and culminates in the terminations before the end of the fiscal year, which is Sept. 30.",
      "As part of his government-cutting initiative, Mr. Trump offered the entire federal workforce, which consists of more than 2 million people, a deferred resignation program, under which they could resign from their jobs but retain full pay and benefits until Sept. 30.",
      "The White House said roughly 75,000 employees accepted the offer, far fewer than the 200,000 it expected to take the so-called buyout.",
      "Thousands of probationary employees, generally considered those who have been in their positions for less than a year, have also been terminated. The Office of Personnel Management instructed agency heads in a Jan. 20 memo to identify all employees in their probationary periods and determine whether they should be kept on.",
      "But after a federal judge ruled last week that the mass firings were likely illegal, OPM revised the memo to clarify that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees. Agencies have ultimate decision-making authority over, and responsibility for, such personnel actions.\"",
      "The VA dismissed more than 2,400 employees last month and said there were more than 40,000 probationary workers across the department.",
      "But Democrats have warned that firing thousands of VA employees will have devastating impacts on the nation's veterans, forcing them to wait longer for medical care, to have disability claims adjudicated and to speak to someone at the Veterans Crisis Line.",
      "\"Donald Trump and Elon Musk are escalating their full-scale, no-holds-barred assault on veterans\u2013and putting the health care and benefits they have earned in grave danger,\" Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington said in a statement. \"It's infuriating that two billionaires think they can fire tens of thousands of people responsible for administering the services and care that over nine million veterans across the country count on. It's flat-out immoral and a breach of the sacred commitment we make to our veterans to take care of them when they return home.\"",
      "Murray is the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sided with the Trump administration in allowing the immediate removal of Hampton Dellinger as head of the Office of Special Counsel while the court battle continues. Dellinger is likely to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "Dellinger sued Mr. Trump last month after he was fired even though the law says special counsels can be removed by the president \"only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Barack Obama, quickly reinstated Dellinger in the job while he pursued his case.",
      "Dellinger's lawyers say allowing the president to fire the special counsel without cause would have a chilling effect on the important duties of the office to protect whistleblowers. The ruling comes as Dellinger is also challenging the removal of probationary workers who were fired as part of the Trump administration's shakeup of the federal government.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the law protecting the special counsel from removal is unconstitutional and unfairly prevents the president from rightfully installing his preferred agency head.",
      "Jackson on Saturday ruled that Dellinger's firing was unlawful and ordered that he remain in his post. But the appeals court lifted Jackson's order blocking his removal while the court considers legal arguments in the case.",
      "The Office of Special Counsel is responsible for guarding the federal workforce from illegal personnel actions, such as retaliation for whistleblowing. It investigates whistleblower claims of reprisal, can pursue disciplinary action against employees who punish whistleblowers and provides a channel for employees to disclose government wrongdoing.",
      "After a request from Dellinger's office, a government panel that enforces workers' rights ruled Wednesday that more than 5,000 employees fired by the Trump administration should be put back on the job at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",

    "summary": "Nearly 100 probationary employees were fired from the Defense Logistics Agency, and more defense cuts are expected.",
    "story": [
      "Reductions at the U.S.' largest federal department began this week, as probationary employees were cut from the Defense Logistics Agency, which is part of the Defense Department.",
      "\"DLA released probationary employees, consistent with the Department of Defense's broader efforts to ensure resources are aligned with the department's strategic objectives,\" a DLA spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Less than 100 workers were fired from the DLA, an agency that manages the supply chain for military services. The DLA has about 25,000 employees who work at its headquarters in Virginia or across the globe, including in support of operations in the Middle East, Indo-Pacific, and Europe.\u00a0Defense One first reported the DLA firings.",
      "More cuts are expected later this week, however, at other Defense Department offices.",
      "The Pentagon issued a memo Monday warning of imminent cuts to civilian employees, according to a copy obtained by CBS News.",
      "The memo, directed to \"Senior Pentagon Leadership,\" states the purpose of the reduction is to \"streamline operations and prioritize critical missions in order to redirect scarce and limited resources towards enhancing the lethality of war fighting capacity.\" It is signed by Darin Selnick, who is performing the duties of undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.",
      "According to the letter, probationary employees whose \"continued employment at the Department would not be in the public interest,\" would be terminated as early as March 3.",
      "A U.S. official confirmed the memo is authentic, but the Defense Department declined to comment.",
      "A previous statement last month from Selnick said an estimated 5,400 probationary employees would be terminated in what was described as an \"initial\" effort.",
      "The Department of Defense is one of several agencies expected to fire employees as part of the DOGE's efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Reductions in force have occurred at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and most recently the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency.",
      "The Department of Veterans Affairs plans to slash as many as 70,000 workers to reach a goal of returning its workforce to 2019 levels of just under 400,000 employees, according to a memo sent to top Veterans Affairs officials. Its reduction-in-force plans are expected to take place in August, according to the memo, which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "At least 23,853 employees have been put on leave or terminated as of the end of February, according to a CBS News' analysis.",
      "This could be just the start of a massive reduction at the Defense Department, where earlier this month, the Pentagon said it anticipated cutting the entire civilian workforce at DoD by 5% to 8% \u2014 as part of a larger effort to decrease the budget at the Defense Department. Funds would also be reappropriated to better align with the Trump administration's programmatic goals.",
      "Civilian employees at the Defense Department serve in a broad spectrum of career roles inside the Pentagon and abroad. They support military operations and handle everything from intelligence analysis to logistics, cybersecurity and contract management. While uniformed service members execute military missions, civilians develop policies, oversee budgets, and maintain the intricate supply chains that keep the armed forces running.",
      "Probationary employees are federal workers who have been on the job for two years or less and are therefore not included in civil service protections.",
      "The Pentagon has about 950,000 civilian employees, according to a Defense Department civilian career\u00a0website. A 5% to 8% reduction would add up to between 47,5000 and 76,000 thousand workers.",

    "title": "Here's what Trump's tariff barrage could mean for your 401(k) plan",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-stock-market-impact-on-your-401k-plan/",
    "published": "Wed, 05 Mar 2025 16:03:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has swung wildly since President Trump placed 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico. Here's what to know about your 401(k).",
    "story": [
      "During his Tuesday night address\u00a0to Congress, President Trump acknowledged his barrage of tariffs might cause \"a little disturbance.\" But with the stock market tumbling this week in reaction to his import duties, workers with 401(k) plans may wonder about how much that disturbance could affect their retirement savings.",
      "The S&P 500 has lost about 3% of its value since Friday, with Wall Street tumbling on Monday and Tuesday after Mr. Trump\u00a0decided to move forward\u00a0with 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. The stock index regained some ground on Wednesday, rising 21 points, or 0.4%, to 5,799 in afternoon trading.",
      "According to Wall Street analysts, the market reaction reflects investor concerns that a trade war could crimp U.S. economic growth and reignite inflation, putting pressure on U.S. consumers who are already financially strained after grappling with several years of elevated price increases. Some recent economic data also points to\u00a0souring outlooks from consumers and businesses, with both groups now\u00a0expecting higher inflation in the face of Mr. Trump's new tariffs.",
      "With uncertainty on the rise, employees exposed to stocks through their retirement plans should brace for more investment volatility, experts say.",
      "\"There is evidence that a cooling in the economy is underway,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst and founder of Vital Knowledge, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"U.S. equities are bearing the brunt of what we're seeing in the U.S. economy right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also sometimes sent mixed messages about its tariff plans, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Tuesday night saying the administration might \"modify the tariffs somewhat.\"",
      "Those mixed signals add to the challenges facing businesses in deciding their strategy, experts say. Because tariffs are paid by U.S. businesses on goods they import from other nations, some companies are uncertain about the costs they'll face moving forward under the Trump administration, Crisafulli said.",
      "\"I look at tariffs as a corporate tax,\" he said. \"Imagine if corporate tax rates were set in this chaotic of a fashion \u2014 it would create a lot of hesitation among companies. They don't know what the ground rules will be.\"",
      "Walmart executives, noting that the U.S. is entering what they characterized as \"an uncertain time,\" said last month that consumers are paring their spending, while Target on Tuesday said costs from tariffs could put \"meaningful pressure\" on the retailer's profits. Such caution is also fueling market volatility, experts said.",
      "\"Uncertainty around the scope and implementation of tariffs is high,\" investment firm BlackRock said in a March 5\u00a0note\u00a0to investors. \"In markets, we think U.S. equities could come under pressure in the next few months as investors seek additional compensation for these risks.\"",
      "How could this impact your 401(k)?",
      "While investors spooked by the roller-coaster stock swings might be tempted to exit the market, that's generally a losing strategy, Crisafulli said. Timing the market, or attempting to buy and sell stocks to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible to execute and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, Charles Schwab research\u00a0has found.",
      "The strategy is almost always doomed to fail because investors don't know when to get back into the market to capture the rebound, while the stock market has historically always recovered even from major setbacks. For instance, investors who sold during the March 2020 rout that followed the eruption of COVID-19 around the U.S. and failed to re-enter the market that year could have missed out on the rebound, with the S&P 500 gaining 15% by the end of December.",
      "For most investors with a 401(k) plan, sticking tight and avoiding checking your balance each day may be the best strategy for coping with volatile periods, experts say.",
      "\"Your 401(k) should be on autopilot, and you don't look at day-to-day volatility,\" Crisafulli said. \"I don't think people should make dramatic changes with their 401(k)s.\"",
      "Still, investors may want to examine their asset allocation and shift to investments that could provide more protection in the face of a possible global trade war, researchers note. For instance, automobile companies could be hard-hit by the Trump administration's tariffs, BlackRock notes, given that U.S. automakers import many components from Mexico and Canada.",
      "Restaurants and grocery companies could also feel the impact of the new tariffs, as U.S. food costs could increase by 3% due to the higher import duties, BlackRock noted.",
      "\"On the other hand, financials and health care services may be relatively insulated, since these sectors have minimal exposure to imported goods,\" the wealth management firm noted.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump vowed that his tariffs \"are about making America rich again and making America great again.\" Some of his goals in implementing the tariffs are to bring about a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing by convincing companies to move factories to the U.S.",
      "While that could take months or even years to pan out, investment experts say it's also important to keep a long-term view on the U.S. economy.",
      "\"It may be hard for investors to believe, but there is more to market volatility than reacting to the latest Trump executive action,\" Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street, wrote in a new report.",
      "Despite recent data that suggests the U.S. economy is slowing, \"an economic growth scare is not the same thing as a recession. And the economic environment remains respectable. U.S. real GDP is likely to expand in the first quarter,\" he added.",
      "Given that the economy is continuing to grow, the labor market remains strong and inflation is still cooling, it's important to \"differentiate between signal and noise,\" Arone said.",
      "\"And, rightly or wrongly, the Trump administration uses the economy and stock market as barometers for its success,\" he added. \"They won't purposefully harm the economy or the bull market.\"",

    "summary": "The controversial Chilean artist had said the exhibition was meant to raise awareness of mass meat production processes.",
    "story": [
      "Three piglets which were being allowed to starve as part of a controversial art exhibition in Denmark that had drawn international attention have been stolen, the artist said on Wednesday.",
      "Chilean-born Marco Evaristti said he had been aiming to raise awareness of the suffering caused by mass meat production with his art installation that opened last week in Copenhagen. The piglets were being denied food and water and would have been allowed to starve to death.",
      "But in an unexpected twist Evaristti has revealed that the piglets \u2014 dubbed Lucia, Simon and Benjamin \u2014 were taken by animal rights activists who were assisted by his friend, Caspar Steffensen.",
      "\"I called up police on Saturday to report the piglets stolen and I had to shut down the entire exhibition because of that \u2014 so I was very disappointed when Caspar told me on Tuesday that he was involved in the theft,\" said Evaristti, who claimed to have received hate mail.",
      "\"But then I thought about it for a few hours and realized that at least this way the piglets would have a happy life,\" he added.",
      "Copenhagen police confirmed Wednesday that it had received reports \"that the pigs had been stolen from the exhibition.\"",
      "Evaristti's \"And Now You Care\" exhibition involved a makeshift cage created with shopping carts containing the three piglets. He said the intention of the art installation was to raise awareness about the cruelties of modern pig production in Denmark.",
      "The Animal Protection Denmark welfare group says that sows are bred in the Danish pig industry to produce about 20 piglets at a time, but only have 14 teats, forcing the piglets to compete for breastmilk, leading to starvation of many.",
      "However, several animal rights groups expressed concern about Evaristti's exhibition, saying that while they welcomed initiatives to raise awareness they did not condone the abuse of animals.",
      "Steffensen said he could not allow the three animals to face a painful death after his 10-year-old daughter had begged him to \"make sure the piggies won't die.\"",
      "\"So when I was approached by an activist to help free the animals, I let them into the gallery secretively on Saturday,\" Steffensen told the AP.",
      "He said he wasn't initially planning to tell Evaristti about the removal of the pigs, but when the animal advocate group De Glemte Danske posted a statement online Tuesday saying it had rescued the piglets, the secret operation became public.",
      "Evaristti says he is already developing ways to revive the exhibition. One idea is to steal dead piglets from meat processing plants and present them to the public. He also wants to buy another three piglets \u2014 not to starve, but to auction to the highest bidder promising them a happy life.",
      "\"I got a lot of hate messages from around the world \u2014 I think people don't get that my art is about animals rights,\" Evaristti said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, in his 2025 address to the joint session of Congress, on March 4, 2025, sought to highlight the\u00a0accomplishments\u00a0of the opening weeks of his second administration. Over an hour and 40 minutes, the longest address of its kind, Mr. Trump spoke of his efforts to contain illegal immigration, the executive orders he has signed and his vision for how Congress should enact his sweeping legislative agenda. He also praised the work of Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency task force, or DOGE, for the drastic cuts they have enacted across the executive branch.",
      "Read the full text of his prepared remarks:",
      "Speaker Johnson, Vice President Vance, the first lady of the United States, members of the United States Congress, thank you very much and to my fellow citizens: America is back. Six weeks ago, I stood beneath the dome of this Capitol and proclaimed the dawn of the Golden Age of America. From that moment on, it has been nothing but swift and unrelenting action to usher in the greatest and most successful era in the history of our country. We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplished in 4 years, 8 years \u2014 and we are just getting started. I return to this chamber tonight to report that America's momentum is back. Our spirit is back. Our pride is back. Our confidence is back. And the American Dream is surging bigger and better than ever before.",
      "The American Dream is unstoppable, and our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed, and perhaps will never witness again. Never been anything like it. The presidential election of November 5th was a mandate like has not been seen in many decades. We won all seven swing states, giving us an Electoral College victory of 312 votes. We won the popular vote by big numbers and won counties in our country 2,700 to 525 on a map that reads almost completely red for Republican.",
      "Now, for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction \u2014 in fact it's an astonishing record, 27-point swing \u2014 the most ever. Likewise, small business optimism saw its single largest one-month gain ever recorded, a 41-point jump. Over the past six weeks, I have signed nearly 100 Executive Orders and taken more than 400 Executive Actions, a record to restore common sense, safety, optimism and wealth all across our wonderful land. The people elected me to do the job, and I am doing it. In fact, it has been stated by many that the first month of our presidency, it's our presidency, is the most successful in the history of our nation. By many.",
      "And what makes it even more impressive, is that you know who number two is? George Washington. How about that? I don't know about that list but we'll take it. Within hours of taking the oath of office, I declared a national emergency on our southern border, and I deployed the U.S. military and Border Patrol to repel the invasion of our country, and what a job they've done. As a result, illegal border crossings last month were by far the lowest ever recorded, ever. They heard my words and they chose not to come. Much easier that way.",
      "In comparison, under Joe Biden, the worst president in American history, there were hundreds of thousands of illegal crossings a month, and virtually all of them, including murderers, drug dealers, gang members and people from mental institutions and insane asylums, were released into our country. Who would want to do that?",
      "This is my fifth such speech to Congress, and once again, I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do. I could find a cure to the most devastating disease, a disease that would wipe out entire nations, or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime to the lowest levels ever recorded, and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements. They won't do it no matter what, five, five times I've been up here. It's very sad, and it just shouldn't be this way.",
      "So, Democrats sitting before me, for just this one night, why not join us in celebrating so many incredible wins for America, for the good of our nation? Let's work together and let's truly make America great again. Every day my administration is fighting to deliver the change America needs to bring a future America deserves and we're doing it. This is a time for big dreams and bold action.",
      "Upon taking office, I imposed an immediate freeze on all federal hiring, a freeze on all new federal regulations, and a freeze on all foreign aid. I terminated the ridiculous green new scam. I withdrew from the unfair Paris Climate Accord, which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying. I withdrew from the corrupt World Health Organization, and I also withdrew from the anti-American U.N. Human Rights Council. We ended all of Biden's environmental restrictions that were making our country far less safe and totally unaffordable. And importantly, we ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate, saving our auto workers and companies from economic destruction. To unshackle our economy, I have directed that for every one new regulation, 10 old regulations must be eliminated, just like I did in my very successful first term. And in that first term, we set records on ending unnecessary rules and regulations like no other president had done before.",
      "We ordered all federal workers to return to the office. They will either show up for work in person or be removed from their job. We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent like me. How did that work out? Not too good, not too good. And I have stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America, it's back. And two days ago I signed an order making English the official language of the United States of America.",
      "I renamed the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America. And likewise, I renamed for a great president, William McKinley, Mount McKinley, again. Beautiful Alaska. We love Alaska. We've ended the tyranny of so-called Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies all across the entire federal government and indeed the private sector and our military. And our country will be woke no longer.",
      "We believe that whether you are a doctor, an accountant, a lawyer or an air traffic controller, you should be hired and promoted based on skill and competence, not race or gender. You should be hired based on merit, and the Supreme Court in a brave and very powerful decision has allowed us to do so. Thank you, thank you very much. We have removed the poison of critical race theory from our public schools and I signed an order making the official policy of the United States government that there are only two genders, male and female.",
      "I also signed an executive order to ban men from playing in women's sports. Three years ago, Payton McNabb was an all-star high school athlete, one of the best, preparing for a future in college sports. But when her girls volleyball match was invaded by a male, he smashed the ball so hard in Payton's face, causing traumatic brain injury, partially paralyzing her right side and ending her athletic career. It was a shot like she's never seen before. She's never seen anything like it. Payton is here tonight in the gallery, and Payton, from now on, schools will kick the men off the girls team or they will lose all federal funding.",
      "And if you really want to see numbers, just take a look at what happened in the women's boxing, weightlifting, track and field, swimming or cycling, where a male recently finished a long-distance race five hours and 14 minutes ahead of a woman for a new record by five hours. Broke the record by five hours. It's demeaning for women, and it's very bad for our country. We're not going to put up with it any longer.",
      "What I have just described is only a small fraction of the common sense revolution that is now because of us sweeping the entire world, common sense has become a common theme, and we will never go back. Never, never going to let that happen. Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families. As you know, we inherited from the last administration an economic catastrophe and an inflation nightmare. Their policies drove up energy prices, pushed up grocery costs, and drove the necessities of life out of reach for millions and millions of Americans, they've never had anything like it. We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years, but perhaps even in the history of our country, they're not sure. As president, I'm fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.",
      "Joe Biden especially let the price of eggs get out of control. The egg prices out of control. And we are working hard to get it back down. Secretary, do a good job on that, you inherited a total mess from that administration. Do a good job. A major focus of our fight to defeat inflation is rapidly reducing the cost of energy. The previous administration cut the number of new oil and gas leases by 95%, slowed pipeline construction to a halt, and closed more than 100 power plants. We are opening up many of those power plants right now. And frankly, we have never seen anything like it.",
      "That's why, on my first day in office, I declared a national energy emergency. As you've heard me say many times, we have more liquid gold under our feet than any nation on Earth. And by far, and now, I fully authorize the most talented team ever assembled to go and get it. It's called drill, baby, drill.",
      "My administration is also working on a gigantic natural gas pipeline in Alaska, among the largest in the world, where Japan, South Korea and other nations want to be our partner with investments of trillions of dollars each. It's never been anything like that one. It will be truly spectacular. It's all set to go. The permitting has gotten and later this week, I will also take historic action to dramatically expand production of critical minerals and rare earths here in the USA.",
      "To further combat inflation, we will not only be reducing the cost of energy, but will be ending the flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.",
      "And to that end I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency. DOGE! Perhaps you've heard of it, perhaps. Which is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight. Thank you, Elon, you're working very hard. He didn't need this, he didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it. Everybody here, even this side, appreciates it I believe. They just don't want to admit that.",
      "Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified: $22 billion from HHS to provide free housing and cars for illegal aliens, $45 million for diversity, equity and inclusion scholarships in Burma, $40 million to improve the social and economic inclusion of sedentary migrants. Nobody knows what that is. $8 million to promote LGBTQ+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, $60 million for indigenous peoples and Afro-Colombian empowerment in Central America. $60 million. $8 million for making mice transgender.",
      "This is real. $32 million for a left-wing propaganda operation in Moldova. $10 million for male circumcision in Mozambique. $20 million for the Arab \"Sesame Street\" in the Middle East, it's a program, $20 million for program. $1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee \u2014 headed up and we know she's involved just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams. Have you ever heard of her? A $3.5 million consulting contract for lavish fish monitoring. $1.5 million for voter confidence in Liberia, $14 million for social cohesion in Mali, $59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City, real estate developers done very well. $250,000 to increase vegan local climate action innovation in Zambia, $42 million for social and behavior change in Uganda, $14 million for improving public procurement in Serbia, $47 million for improving learning outcomes in Asia. Asia is doing very well with learning. You know what we're doing? Should use it ourselves. A $101 million for DEI contracts at the Department of Education. The most ever paid, nothing even like it. Under the Trump administration, all of these scams and there are far worse, but I didn't think it was appropriate to talk about them, they're so bad. Many more have been found out and exposed and swiftly terminated by a group of very intelligent, mostly young people headed up by Elon, and we appreciate it. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.",
      "And we've taken back the money and reduced our debt to fight inflation and other things. Taking back a lot of that money, we got it just in time. This is just the beginning. The Government Accountability Office, federal government office, has estimated annual fraud of over $500 billion in our nation, and we are working very hard to stop it. We're going to. We're also identifying shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors and that our seniors and people that we love rely on.",
      "Believe it or not, government databases list 4.7 million Social Security members from people aged 100 to 109 years old. It lists 3.6 million people from ages 110 to 119. I don't know any of them. I know some people that are rather elderly, but not quite that elderly. 3.47 million people from ages 120 to 129, 3.9 million people from ages 130 to 139, 3.5 million people from ages 140 to 149, and money is being paid to many of them, and we're searching right now. In fact, Pam, good luck, good luck. You're going to find it. But a lot of money is paid out to people, because it just keeps getting paid and paid, and nobody does, and it really hurts Social Security and hurts our country, 1.3 million people from ages 150 to 159 and over 130,000 people, according to the Social Security databases, are age over 160 years old. We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby.",
      "Including, to finish, 1,039 people between the ages of 220 and 229, one person between the age of 240 and 249 and one person is listed at 360 years of age \u2014 more than 100 years, more than 100 years older than our country. But we're going to find out where that money is going, and it's not going to be pretty, by slashing all of the fraud, waste and theft. And theft we can find. We will defeat inflation, bring down mortgage rates, lower car payments and grocery prices, protect our seniors and put more money in the pockets of American families.",
      "And today, interest rates took a beautiful drop. Big beautiful drop. It's about time. And in the near future I want to do what has not been done in 24 years \u2014 balance the federal budget, we're gonna balance it.",
      "With that goal in mind, we have developed in great detail what we are calling the Gold Card, which goes on sale very, very soon. For $5 million we will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship. It's like the green card, but better and more sophisticated. And these people will have to pay tax in our country. They won't have to pay tax from where they came, the money that they've made, you wouldn't want to do that. But they have to pay tax, create jobs. They'll also be taking people out of colleges and paying for them so that we can keep them in our country, instead of having them being forced out. Number one at the top school as an example, being forced out and not being allowed to stay and create tremendous numbers of jobs and great success for a company out there.",
      "So while we take out the criminals, killers, traffickers and child predators who are allowed to enter our country under the open border policy of these people, the Democrats, the Biden administration, the open border, insane policies that you've allowed to destroy our country, we will now bring in brilliant, hardworking job-creating people. They're going to pay a lot of money, and we're going to reduce our debt with that money.",
      "Americans have given us a mandate for bold and profound change. For nearly 100 years the federal bureaucracy has grown until it has crushed our freedoms, ballooned our deficits, and held back America's potential in every possible way. The nation founded by pioneers and risk takers, now drowns under millions and millions of pages of regulations and debt. Approvals that should take 10 days to get instead, take 10 years, 15 years, and even 20 years before you reject it. Meanwhile, we have hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have not been showing up to work. My administration will reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy, and we will restore true democracy to America again. Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately.",
      "Because we are draining the swamp, it's very simple, and the days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over. And the next phase of our plan to deliver the greatest economy in history is for this Congress to pass tax cuts for everybody. They're in there, they're waiting for you to vote. And I'm sure that the people on my right \u2014 I don't mean the Republican right, but my right, right here \u2014 I'm sure you're going to vote for those tax cuts, because otherwise I don't believe the people will ever vote you into office. So I'm doing you a big favor by telling you that. But I know this group is going to be voting for the tax cut. A very, very big part of our plan, we had tremendous success in our first term with it, a very big part of our plan. We're seeking permanent income tax cuts all across the board and to get urgently needed relief to Americans hit especially hard by inflation. I'm calling for no tax on tips, no tax overtime and no tax on Social Security benefits for our great seniors.",
      "And I also want to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible, but only if the car is made in America. Oh, and by the way, we're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody's ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made like never seen. That's a combination of the election win and tariffs. It's a beautiful word, isn't it? That that along with our other policies will allow our auto industry to absolutely boom. It's going to boom. Spoke to the majors today. All three, the top people and they're so excited. In fact, already numerous car companies have announced that they will be building massive automobile plants in America, with Honda just announcing a new plant in Indiana, one of the largest anywhere in the world. And this has taken place since a great victory on November 5th, a date which will hopefully go down as one of the most important in the history of our country. In addition, as part of our tax cuts, we want to cut taxes on domestic production and all manufacturing. And just as we did before, we will provide 100% expensing. It will be retroactive to January 20th, 2025.",
      "And it was one of the main reasons why our tax cuts were so successful in our first term, giving us the most successful economy in the history of our country. First term, we had a great first term. And if you don't make your product in America, however, under the Trump administration, you will pay a tariff and in some cases a rather large one. Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries. On average, the European Union, China, Brazil, India, Mexico and Canada. Have you heard of them? And countless other nations charge us tremendously higher tariffs than we charge them. It's very unfair. India charges us auto tariffs higher than 100%. China's average tariff on our products is twice what we charge them. And South Korea's average tariff is four times higher. Think of that, four times higher. And we give so much help militarily and in so many other ways to South Korea.",
      "But that's what happens. This is happening by friend and foe. This system is not fair to the United States and never was. And so on April 2nd, I wanted to make an April 1st, but I didn't want to be accused of April Fool's Day. That's what one day would cost us, a lot of money, but we're going to do it in April. I'm a very superstitious person. April 2nd reciprocal tariffs kick in and whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them. That's reciprocal back and forth. Whatever they tax us, we will tax them.",
      "If they do non-monetary tariffs to keep us out of their market, then we will do non-monetary barriers to keep them out of our market. It's a lot of that too. They don't even allow us in that market. We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before. I did it with China and I did it with others and the Biden administration couldn't do anything about it because there was so much money. They couldn't do anything about it. We've been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on Earth, and we will not let that happen any longer. Much has been said over the last three months about Mexico and Canada, but we have very large deficits with both of them. But even more importantly, they've allowed fentanyl to come into our country at levels never seen before, killing hundreds of thousands of our citizens and many very young, beautiful people destroying families. Nobody's ever seen anything like it.",
      "They are, in effect, receiving subsidies of hundreds of billions of dollars. We pay subsidies to Canada and to Mexico, have hundreds of billions of dollars in the United States, will not be doing that any longer. We're not going to do it any longer.",
      "Thanks to our America First policies we're putting into place, we have had $1.7 trillion of new investment in America in just the past few weeks. The combination of the election and our economic policies that people love. SoftBank, one of the most brilliant anywhere in the world, announced a $200 billion investment. OpenAI and Oracle, Larry Ellison, announced $500 billion investment, which they wouldn't have done if Kamala had won. Apple announced $500 billion investment. Tim Cook called me, said, I cannot spend it fast enough, it's got to be much higher than that. I believe they'll be building their plants here instead of in China. And just yesterday, Taiwan Semiconductor, the biggest in the world's most powerful in the world, has a tremendous amount \u2014 97% of the market \u2014 announced a $165 billion investment to build the most powerful chips on Earth right here in the U.S.A. And we're not giving them any money.",
      "Your CHIPS Act is a horrible, horrible thing. We give hundreds of billions of dollars and it doesn't mean a thing. They take our money and they don't spend it. All that meant to them. We're giving them no money. All that was important to them was they didn't want to pay the tariffs. So they came and they're building. And many other companies are coming. We don't have to give them money, we just want to protect our businesses and our people, and they will come because they won't have to pay tariffs if they build in America. So it's very amazing. You should get rid of the CHIPS Act and whatever's left over, Mr. Speaker, you should use it to reduce debt or any other reason you want to.",
      "A new trade policy will also be great for the American farmer. I love the farmer. We'll now be selling it to our home market in the U.S.A., because nobody is going to be able to compete with you. Because those goods that come in from other countries and companies, they're really, really in a bad position in so many different ways. They're uninspected. They may be very dirty and disgusting and they come in and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.",
      "The tariffs will go on agricultural product coming into America and our farmers starting on April 2nd, it may be a little bit of an adjustment period, we had that before when I made the deal with China, $50 billion of purchases and I said, just bear with me. And they did, they did. You really have to bear with me again and this will be even better. That was great. The problem with it was that Biden didn't enforce it. He didn't enforce it. $50 billion of purchases. And we were doing great. But Biden did not enforce it, and it hurt our farmers. But our farmers are going to have a field day right now. So to our farmers, have a lot of fun. I love you, too. I love you too.",
      "And I have also imposed a 25% tariff on foreign aluminum, copper, lumber and steel because if we don't have, as an example, steel and lots of other things, we don't have a military and frankly we just won't have a country very long. Here today is a proud American steelworker, fantastic person from Decatur, Alabama. Jeff Denard has been working at the same steel plant for 27 years in a job that has allowed him to serve as the captain of his local volunteer fire department, raise seven children with his beautiful wife, Nicole, and over the years provide a loving home for more than 40 foster children. So great, Jeff. Thank you, Jeff. Stories like Jeff's remind us that tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs.",
      "They're about protecting the soul of our country. Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it's happening. And it will happen rather quickly. There'll be a little disturbance, but we're okay with that. It won't be much. No you're not, oh. And look, look where Biden took us, it's very low, the lowest we've ever been.",
      "Jeff, I want to thank you very much. And I also want to recognize another person who has devoted herself to foster care community. She worked so hard on it, her very loving person, our magnificent first lady of the United States. Melania's work has yielded incredible results, helping prepare our nation's future leaders as they enter the workforce.",
      "Our first lady is joined by two impressive young women. Very impressive. Haley Ferguson, who benefited from the First Ladies Fostering the Future initiative and is poised to complete her education, become a teacher. And Allison Berry, who became a victim of an illicit, deepfake image produced by a peer. With Allison's help, the Senate just passed the Take It Down Act, and this is so important. Thank you very much, John Thune. Thank you, Senator. Thank you, John. Thank you all very much. Thank you.",
      "And thank you to John Thune and the Senate. Great job to criminalize the publication of such images online. Just terrible, terrible thing. And once it passes the House, I look forward to signing that bill into law. Thank you. And I'm going to use that bill for myself, too, if you don't mind. There's nobody gets treated worse than I do online. Nobody. That's great. Thank you very much to the Senate. Thank you.",
      "But if we truly care about protecting America's children, no step is more crucial than securing America's borders. Over the past four years, 21 million people poured into the United States, many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members, and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world because of Joe Biden's insane and very dangerous open border policies. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast. And I want to thank Tom Homan and Kristi, I want to thank you, and Paul and Border Patrol. I want to thank you. What a job they've all done. Everybody. Border Patrol, ICE, law enforcement in general is incredible. We have to take care of our law enforcement.",
      "Last year, a brilliant 22 year-old nursing student named Laken Riley, the best in her class, admired by everybody, went out for a jog on the campus of the University of Georgia. That morning Laken was viciously attacked, assaulted, beaten, brutalized, and horrifically murdered. Lincoln was stolen from us by a savage illegal alien gang member who was arrested while trespassing across Biden's open southern border and then sent loose into the United States under the heartless policies of that failed administration. It was indeed a failed administration. He had then been arrested and released in a Democrat-run sanctuary city, a disaster, before ending the life of this beautiful young angel. With us this evening, our Laken's beloved mother Allyson and her sister Lauren.",
      "Last year, I told Laken's grieving parents that we would ensure their daughter would not have died in vain. That's why the very first bill I signed into law as your 47th president mandates the detention of all dangerous criminal aliens who threaten public safety. Very strong, powerful act. It's called the Laken Riley Act. So, Allyson and Lauren, America will never, ever forget our beautiful Laken Hope Riley. Thank you very much.",
      "Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history. And we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded. Thank you. The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president. Joe Biden didn't just open our borders. He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country. Entire towns like Aurora, Colorado and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before. Beautiful towns destroyed. Now, just as I promised in my inaugural address, we are achieving the great liberation of America. But there still is much work to be done.",
      "Here tonight is a woman I have gotten to know, Alexis Nungaray from Houston. Wonderful woman. Last June, Alexis' 12-year-old daughter, her precious Jocelyn, walked to a nearby convenience store. She was kidnapped, tied up, assaulted for two hours under a bridge, and horrifically murdered. Arrested and charged with this heinous crime are two illegal alien monsters from Venezuela released into America by the last administration through their ridiculous open border.",
      "The death of this beautiful 12-year-old girl and the agony of her mother and family touched our entire nation greatly. Alexis, I promised that we would always remember your daughter, your magnificent daughter. And earlier tonight, I signed an order keeping my word to you. One thing I have learned about Jocelyn is that she loved animals so much. She loved nature. Across Galveston Bay, from where Jocelyn lived in Houston you will find a magnificent national wildlife refuge, a pristine, peaceful, 34,000-acre sanctuary for all of God's creatures on the edge of the Gulf of America.",
      "Alexis. Moments ago, I formally renamed that refuge in loving memory of your beautiful daughter, Jocelyn. Mr. Vice President, if you would, may I have the order? Thank you very much. All three savages charged with Jocelyn and Laken's murders were members of the Venezuelan prison gang. The toughest gang, they say, in the world known as Tren de Aragua. Two weeks ago, I officially designated this gang, along with MS-13 and the bloodthirsty Mexican drug cartels, as foreign terrorist organizations. They are now officially in the same category as ISIS, and that's not good for them. Countless thousands of these terrorists were welcomed into the U.S. by the Biden administration. But now every last one will be rounded up and forcibly removed from our country. Or, if they are too dangerous, put in jails, standing trial in this country because we don't want them to come back ever.",
      "With us this evening is a warrior on the frontline of that battle. Border Patrol agent Roberto Ortiz, great guy. In January, Roberto and another agent were patrolling by the Rio Grande near an area known as Cartel Island. Doesn't sound too nice to me. When heavily armed gunmen started shooting at them, Roberto saw that his partner was totally exposed to great danger, and he leapt into action, returning fire and providing crucial seconds for his fellow agent to seek safety, and just barely. I have some of the prints of that event and it was not good. Agent Ortiz, we salute you for your great courage and your line of fire that you took and for the bravery that you showed. We honor you, and we will always honor you. Thank you, Roberto, very much. And I actually got to know him on my many calls to the border. He's a great, great gentleman. The territory to the immediate south of our border is now dominated entirely by criminal cartels that murder, rape, torture and exercise total control. They have total control over a whole nation. posing a grave threat to our national security.",
      "The cartels are waging war in America, and it's time for America to wage war on the cartels. Five nights ago, Mexican authorities, because of our tariff policies being imposed on them, think of this, handed over to us 29 of the biggest cartel leaders in their country. That has never happened before. They want to make us happy. First time ever. But we need Mexico and Canada to do much more than they've done, and they have to stop the fentanyl and drugs pouring into the U.S.A. They're going to stop it.",
      "I have sent Congress a detailed funding request, laying out exactly how we will eliminate these threats to protect our homeland and complete the largest deportation operation in American history. Larger even than current record holder President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a moderate man but someone who believed very strongly in borders. Americans expect Congress to send me this funding without delay so I can sign it into law. So, Mr. Speaker, John Thune, both of you, I hope you're going to be able to do that. Mr. Speaker, thank you, Mr. Leader, thank you. Thank you very much. And let's get it to me. I'll sign it so fast you won't even believe it.",
      "And as we reclaim our sovereignty, we must also bring back law and order to our cities and towns. In recent years, our justice system has been turned upside down by radical left lunatics.",
      "Many jurisdictions virtually ceased enforcing the law against dangerous repeat offenders while weaponizing law enforcement against political opponents like me. My administration has acted swiftly and decisively to restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law. Starting at the FBI and the DOJ, Pam. Good luck. Kash, wherever you may be. Good luck, good luck. Pam Bondi. Good luck. So important. Gonna to do a great job. Kash. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Kash.",
      "They have already started very strong. They're going to do a fantastic job. You're going to be very proud of them. We're also once again giving our police officers the support, protection and respect they show dearly deserve. They have to get it. They have such a hard, dangerous job. But we're going to make it less dangerous. The problem is the bad guys don't respect the law, but they're starting to respect it, and they soon will respect it.",
      "This also includes our great fire departments throughout the country. Our firemen and women are unbelievable people, and I will never forget them. And besides that, they voted for me in record numbers. So I have no choice.",
      "One year ago this month, 31-year-old New York police officer Jonathan Diller, unbelievably wonderful person and a great officer, was gunned down at a traffic stop on Long Island. I went to his funeral. A vicious criminal charged with his murder had 21 prior arrests -- and they were rough arrests, too. He was a real bad one. The thug in the seat next to him had 14 prior arrests, and went by the name of Killer. He was Killer. He killed other people, they say, a lot of them. I attended Officer Tiller's service, and when I met his wife and one-year-old son, Ryan, it was very inspirational, actually. His widow's name is Stephanie and she is here tonight. Thank you very much Stephanie. Thank you very much.",
      "Stephanie, we're going to make sure that Ryan knows his dad was a true hero. New York's finest. And we're going to get these cold-blooded killers and repeat offenders off our streets. And we're going to do it fast. Gotta stop it. They get out with 28 arrests. They push people into subway trains. They hit people over the head, back of the head with baseball bats. We got to get him out of here.",
      "I've already signed an executive order requiring a mandatory death penalty for anyone who murders a police officer. And tonight, I'm asking Congress to pass that policy into permanent law.",
      "I'm also asking for a new crime bill getting tougher on repeat offenders while enhancing protections for America's police officers so they can do their jobs without fear of their lives being totally destroyed. They don't want to be killed. We're not going to let them be killed.",
      "Joining us to the gallery tonight is a young man who truly loves our police. His name is D.J. Daniel. He is 13 years old, and he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer. But in 2018, D.J. was diagnosed with brain cancer. The doctors gave him five months, at most, to live. That was more than six years ago. Since that time, D.J. and his dad have been on a quest to make his dream come true. And D.J. has been sworn in as an honorary law enforcement officer. Actually, a number of times. The police love him. The police departments love him. And tonight, D.J., we're going to do you the biggest honor of them all. I am asking our new Secret Service director, Sean Curran, to officially make you an agent of the United States secret Service. Thank you, D.J.",
      "D.J.'s doctors believe his cancer likely came from a chemical he was exposed to when he was younger. Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%. Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again, chaired by our new Secretary of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. With a name Kennedy, you would have thought everybody over here would have been cheering. How quickly they forget.",
      "Our goal is to get toxins out of our environment, poisons out of our food supply, and keep our children healthy and strong. As an example, not long ago \u2014 and you can't even believe these numbers \u2014 one in 10,000 children had autism. One in 10,000, and now it's one in 36. There's something wrong. One in 36. Think of that. So, we're going to find out what it is, and there's nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you. You have the best to figure out what is going on. Okay, Bobby. Good luck. It's a very important job. Thank you.",
      "My administration is also working to protect children from toxic ideologies in our schools. A few years ago, January Littlejohn and her husband discovered that their daughter's school had secretly socially transitioned their 13-year-old little girl. Teachers and administrators conspired to deceive January and her husband while encouraging their daughter to use a new name and pronouns--they/them pronouns, actually \u2014 or without telling January, who is here tonight and is now a courageous advocate against this form of child abuse. January, thank you. Thank you.",
      "Stories like this are why, shortly after taking office, I signed an executive order banning public schools from indoctrinating our children with transgender ideology. I also signed an order to cut off all taxpayer funding to any institution that engages in the sexual mutilation of our youth. And now, I want Congress to pass a bill permanently banning and criminalizing sex changes on children and forever ending the lie that any child is trapped in the wrong body. This is a big lie. And our message to every child in America is that you are perfect exactly the way God made you.",
      "Because we're getting wokeness out of our schools and out of our military, and it's already out, and it's out of our society. We don't want it. Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad. It's gone. It's gone. And we feel so much better for it. Don't we? Don't we feel better? Our service members won't be activists and ideologues. They will be fighters and warriors. They will fight for our country and Pete, congratulations, secretary of defense. And he's not big into the woke movement, I can tell you. I know him well.",
      "I am pleased to report that in January, the U.S. Army had its single best recruiting month in 15 years and that all armed services are having among the best recruiting results ever in the history of our services. What a difference. And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results.",
      "And, you know, it was just a few months ago where the results were exactly the opposite. We couldn't recruit anywhere. We couldn't recruit. Now we're having the best results just about that we've ever had. What a tremendous turnaround. It's really a beautiful thing to see. People love our country again. It's very simple. They love our country and they love being in our military again. So it's a great thing. And thank you very much. Great job.",
      "We're joined tonight by a young man, Jason Hartley, who knows the weight of that call of duty. Jason's father, grandfather and great-grandfather all wore the uniform. Jason tragically lost his dad, who was also a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, when he was just a boy and now he wants to carry on the family legacy of service. Jason is a senior in high school, a six-letter varsity athlete \u2014 a really good athlete, they say. A brilliant student with a 4.46 \u2014 that's good \u2014 GPA and his greatest dream is to attend the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",

      "Thank you. Jason, you're going to be on the Long Gray Line, Jason. As commander in chief, my focus is on building the most powerful military of the future. As a first step, I'm asking Congress to fund a state of the art \"golden dome\" missile defense shield to protect our homeland. All made in the U.S.A.",

      "And other place \u2014 they have it. Israel has it. Other places have it. And the United States should have it too, right? Kim. Right. They should have it too. So I want to thank you, but it's a very, very important. This is a very dangerous world. We should have it. We want to be protected and we're going to protect our citizens like never before.",
      "To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding. And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America, where it belongs.",
      "We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon. It will have a huge impact.",

      "Just today, a large American company announced they are buying both ports around the Panama Canal and lots of other things having to do with the Panama Canal and a couple of other canals. The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it.",
      "But it was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure. 38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria. They died of snakebites and mosquitoes. Not a nice place to work.",
      "They paid them very highly to go there, knowing there was a 25% chance that they would die. The most expensive project also that was ever built in our country's history if you bring it up to modern-day costs. It was given away by the Carter administration for $1. But that agreement has been violated very severely.",
      "We didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.",
      "Now we have Marco Rubio in charge. Good luck, Marco. Now we know who to blame if anything goes wrong. Marco has been amazing, and he's going to do a great job. Think of it. He got 100 votes. You know, he was approved with actually 99, but the 100th was this gentleman. And I feel very certain, so let's assume we got 100 votes. And I'm either very, very happy about that or I'm very concerned about it.",
      "But he's already proven \u2014 I mean, he's a great gentleman. He's respected by everybody. And we appreciate you voting for Marco. He's going to do a fantastic job. Thank you, thank you. He's doing a great job. Great job.",
      "And I also have a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland. We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.",
      "We need Greenland for national security and even international security. And we're working with everybody involved to try and get it. But we need it really for international world security. And I think we're going to get it. One way or the other, we're going to get it.",
      "We will keep you safe. We will make you rich. And together we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before.",

      "Three and a half years ago, ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from Afghanistan. Not that they were withdrawing. It was the way they withdrew. Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country.",

      "And I want to thank, especially, the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, most of them, whose children were murdered, and the many people that were so badly, over 42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan.",
      "What a horrible day. Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe this is my chance. That's how bad it was. Should have never happened. Grossly incompetent people.",
      "I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. I spoke to them on the phone. We had a big call. Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with happiness. They were very happy. It's happy as you can be under those circumstances. Their child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever.",

The letter reads: 'Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer. Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time that is convenient for you.\"",

      "To Mark and his great mom: We are delighted to have you safe and sound and with us.",
      "As fate would have it, Mark Fogel was born in a small, rural town in Butler, Pennsylvania. Have you heard of it? Where his mother has lived for the past 78 years. I just happened to go there last July 13th for a rally.",

When the sound of gunshots pierced the air, it was a horrible sound. Corey knew instantly what it was and what to do. He threw himself on top of his wife and daughters and shielded them from the bullets with his own body. Corey was hit really hard. You know the story from there. He sacrificed his life to save theirs. Two others, very fine people, were also seriously hit, but thankfully, with the help of two great country doctors- \u2014 we thought they were gone and they were saved \u2014 so those doctors had great talent. We're joined by Corey's wife, Helen, who was his high school sweetheart, and their two beloved daughters, Allison and Kaylee. Thank you.",
      "To Helen, Allison and Kaylee: Corey is looking down on his three beautiful ladies right now, and he is cheering you on. He loves you. He is cheering you on. Corey was taken from us much too soon, but his destiny was to leave us all with a shining example of the selfless devotion of a true American patriot.

      "As we have seen in this chamber tonight, that same strength, faith, love and spirit is still alive and thriving in the hearts of the American people. Despite the best efforts of those who would try to censor us, silence us, break us, destroy us, Americans are today a proud, free, sovereign and independent nation that will always be free, and we will fight for it 'til death. We will never let anything happen to our beloved country because we are a country of doers, dreamers, fighters and survivors.",
      "Our ancestors crossed a vast ocean, strode into the unknown wilderness, and carved their fortunes from the rock and soil of a perilous and very dangerous frontier. They chased our destiny across a boundless continent. They built the railroads, laid the highways, and graced the world with American marvels like the Empire State Building, the mighty Hoover Dam, and the towering Golden Gate Bridge. They lit the world with electricity, broke free of the force of gravity, fired up the engines of American industry, vanquished the communists, fascists and Marxists all over the world, and gave us countless modern wonders sculpted out of iron, glass and steel. We stand on the shoulders of these pioneers who won and built the modern age, these workers who poured their sweat into the skylines of our cities, these warriors who shed their blood on fields of battle and gave everything they had for our rights and for our freedom.",
      "Now it is our time to take up the righteous cause of American liberty, and it is our turn to take America's destiny into our own hands and begin the most thrilling days in the history of our country. This will be our greatest era. With God's help, over the next four years, we are going to lead this nation even higher, and we are going to forge the freest, most advanced, most dynamic and most dominant civilization ever to exist on the face of this Earth.",
      "We are going to create the highest quality of life, build the safest and wealthiest and healthiest and most vital communities anywhere in the world. We are going to conquer the vast frontiers of science, and we are going to lead humanity into space and plant the American flag on the planet Mars, and even far beyond.",
      "And through it all, we are going to rediscover the unstoppable power of the American spirit. And we are going to renew unlimited promise of the American dream. Every single day we will stand up and we will fight, fight, fight for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve. My fellow Americans, get ready for an incredible future, because the golden Age of America has only just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before. Thank you.

      "A toddler who was kidnapped by her non-custodial parent in 1999 has been found, according to forensic genetic genealogy company Othram.",
      "Andrea Michelle Reyes was 23 months old when she was allegedly abducted from New Haven, Connecticut, by her mother, Rosa Tenorio, who did not have custody of the child. An investigation was launched, and a felony warrant for custodial interference was issued, Othram said in a news release.",
      "Officials believed that Tenorio had taken Reyes to Puebla, Mexico, according to Othram and the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System, but the pair were never located. Another felony warrant was released in 2009, according to the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.",
      "Investigations into her disappearance continued. Authorities released multiple age progression photos showing how she might have looked as the years passed. Reyes' father \"searched tirelessly\" over the years, Othram said, but there were no developments in the case. Othram said that \"individuals\" even went to Mexico to Reyes' reported location, but she could not be found.",
      "In 2023, the New Haven Police Department began to re-investigate the case, Othram said. That led to a woman claiming to be Reyes making contact with the man she believed to be her father. The New Haven Police Department and Othram worked together to confirm the two were related.",
      "The woman provided a DNA sample, which was compared to Reyes' father's DNA. The comparison confirmed \"that the woman who reached out is, in fact, the nearly two-year-old girl kidnapped in October of 1999,\" Othram said.",
      "Reyes, now 27, lives in Mexico. It's not clear what her relationship with her mother is. Othram did not say if she had reunited with her father since the positive identification was made. CBS News has reached out to the New Haven Police Department for more information.",
      "Othram said this is the seventh case in Connecticut where officials have used the company's technology to identify an individual. The case was investigated as part of Othram's Project 525 initiative.

    "summary": "Read the full text of Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin's prepared remarks for her 2025 Democratic response to Trump's speech to Congress, as released.",
    "story": [
      "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin in her brief Democratic response to President Trump's joint address to Congress warned that Mr. Trump, in the his first few weeks of his second presidential term, has taken \"reckless\" approaches to managing the U.S. economy and foreign affairs.",
      "Here's the full text of her remarks, which ran just 10 minutes, compared to Mr. Trump's speech, which was an hour and 40 minutes long:",
      "Hi everyone. I'm Elissa Slotkin. I'm honored to have the opportunity to speak tonight. It's late \u2014 so I promise to be a lot shorter than what you just watched.",
      "I won't take it personally if you've never heard of me. I'm the new senator from the great state of Michigan, where I grew up. I've been in public service my entire life, because I happened to be in New York City on 9/11 when the twin towers came down. Before the smoke cleared, I knew I wanted a life in national security.",
      "I was recruited by the CIA and did three tours in Iraq, alongside the military. In between, I worked at the White House under President Bush and President Obama, two very different leaders who both believed that America is exceptional.",
      "You can find that same sense of patriotism here in Wyandotte, Michigan, where I am tonight. It's a working-class town just south of Detroit. President Trump and I both won here in November. It might not seem like it, but plenty of places like this still exist all across the United States \u2013 places where people believe that if you work hard, and play by the rules, you should do well and your kids do better.",
      "It reminds me of how I grew up. My dad was a lifelong Republican, my mom a lifelong Democrat. But it was never a big deal. Because we had shared values that were bigger than any one party.",
      "We just went through another fraught election season. Americans made it clear that prices are too high and that government needs to be more responsive to their needs. America wants change. But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.",
      "So that's what I'm going to lay out tonight.",
      "Because whether you're in Wyandotte or Wichita, most Americans share three core beliefs: That the Middle Class is the engine of our country. That strong national security protects us from harm. And that our democracy, no matter how messy, is unparalleled and worth fighting for.",
      "Let's start with the economy.",
      "Michigan literally invented the Middle Class: the revolutionary idea that you could work at an auto plant and afford the car you were building. That's the American Dream. And in order to expand and protect the Middle Class, we have to do a few, basic things:",
      "We need to bring down the price of things we spend the most money on: Groceries. Housing. Healthcare. Your car.",
      "We need to make more things in America with good-paying, union jobs \u2014 and bring our supply chains back home from places like China.",
      "We need to give American businesses the certainty they need to invest and create the jobs of the future.",
      "And we need a tax system that's fair for people who don't happen to make a billion dollars.",
      "Look, President Trump talked a big game on the economy, but it's always important to read the fine print. So: do his plans actually help Americans get ahead?",
      "Not even close.",
      "President Trump is trying to deliver an unprecedented giveaway to his billionaire friends. He's on the hunt to find trillions of dollars to pass along to the wealthiest in America. And to do that, he's going to make you pay in every part of your life.",
      "Grocery and home prices are going up, not down \u2014 and he hasn't laid out a credible plan to deal with either.",
      "His tariffs on allies like Canada will raise prices on energy, lumber, cars \u2014 and start a trade war that will hurt manufacturing and farmers.",
      "Your premiums and prescriptions will cost more because the math on his proposals doesn't work without going after your health care.",
      "Meanwhile, for those keeping score, the national debt is going up, not down. And if he's not careful, he could walk us right into a recession.",
      "And one more thing: In order to pay for his plan, he could very well come after your retirement \u2013 the Social Security, Medicare, and VA benefits you worked your whole life to earn. The President claims he won't, but Elon Musk just called Social Security \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\"",
      "While we're on the subject of Elon Musk, is there anyone in America who is comfortable with him and his gang of 20-year-olds using their own computer servers to poke through your tax returns, your health information, and your bank accounts? No oversight. No protections against cyber-attack. No guardrails on what they do with your private data.",
      "We need more efficient government. You want to cut waste, I'll help you do it. But change doesn't need to be chaotic or make us less safe.",
      "The mindless firing of people who work to protect our nuclear weapons, keep our planes from crashing, and conduct the research that finds the cure for cancer \u2014 only to re-hire them two days later? No CEO in America could do that without being summarily fired.",
      "OK, so we've talked about our economic security. How about national security?",
      "Let's start with the border. As someone who spent my whole career protecting our homeland, every country deserves to know who and what is coming across its border. Period. Democrats and Republicans should all be for that.",
      "But securing the border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants. We need a functional system, keyed to the needs of our economy, that allows vetted people to come and work here legally. So I look forward to the President's plan on that.",
      "Because here's the thing: Today's world is deeply interconnected. Migration, cyber threats, AI, environmental destruction, terrorism \u2014 one nation cannot face these issues alone. We need friends in all corners \u2014 and our safety depends on it.",
      "President Trump loves to promise \"peace through strength.\" That's actually a line he stole from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just took place in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave. We all want an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to combine our military and economic might with moral clarity.",
      "And that scene in the Oval Office wasn't just a bad episode of reality TV. It summed up Trump's whole approach to the world. He believes in cozying up to dictators like Vladimir Putin and kicking our friends, like Canada, in the teeth. He sees American leadership as merely a series of real estate transactions.",
      "As a Cold War kid, I'm thankful it was Reagan and not Trump in office in the 1980s. Trump would have lost us the Cold War.",
      "Donald Trump's actions suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we are an exceptional nation. He clearly doesn't think we should lead the world.",
      "Look, America's not perfect. But I stand with most Americans who believe we are still exceptional. Unparalleled. And I would rather have American leadership over Chinese or Russian leadership any day of the week.",
      "Because for generations, America has offered something better.",
      "Our security and our prosperity, yes. But our democracy, our very system of government, has been the aspiration of the world. And right now, it's at risk.",
      "It's at risk when a president decides he can pick and choose what rules he wants to follow, when he ignores court orders or the Constitution itself, or when elected leaders stand idly by and just let it happen.",
      "But it's also at risk when the President pits Americans against each other, when he demonizes those who are different, and tells certain people they shouldn't be included.",
      "Because America is not just a patch of land between two oceans. We are more than that. Generations have fought and died to secure the fundamental rights that define us. Those rights and the fight for them make us who we are.",
      "We are a nation of strivers. Risk-takers. Innovators. And we are never satisfied.",
      "That is America's superpower.",
      "And look, I've lived and worked in many countries. I've seen democracies flicker out. I've seen what life is like when a government is rigged. You can't open a business without paying off a corrupt official. You can't criticize the guys in charge without getting a knock at the door in the middle of the night.",
      "So as much as we need to make our government more responsive to our lives today, don't for one moment fool yourself that democracy isn't precious and worth saving.",
      "But how do we actually do that? I know a lot of you have been asking that question.",
      "First, don't tune out. It's easy to be exhausted, but America needs you now more than ever. If previous generations had not fought for democracy, where would we be today?",
      "Second, hold your elected officials, including me, accountable. Watch how they're voting. Go to town halls and demand they take action. That's as American as apple pie.",
      "Three, organize. Pick just one issue you're passionate about \u2014 and engage. And doom scrolling doesn't count. Join a group that cares about your issue, and act. And if you can't find one, start one.",
      "Some of the most important movements in our history have come from the bottom up.",
      "In closing, we all know that our country is going through something right now. We're not sure what the next day is going to hold, let alone the next decade.",
      "But this isn't the first time we've experienced significant and tumultuous change as a country. I'm a student of history, and we've gone through periods of political instability before. And ultimately, we've chosen to keep changing this country for the better.",
      "But every single time, we've only gotten through those moments because of two things: Engaged citizens and principled leaders.",
      "Engaged citizens who do a little bit more than they're used to doing to fight for the things they care about. And principled leaders who are ready to receive the ball and do something about it.",
      "So thank you tonight for caring about your country. Just by watching, you qualify as engaged citizens. And I promise that I, and my fellow Democrats, will do everything in our power to be the principled leaders that you deserve.",
      "Goodnight everyone.",

    "story": [
      "Takamatsu Gushiken turns on a headtorch and enters a cave buried in Okinawa's jungle. He gently runs his fingers through the gravel until two pieces of bone emerge. These are from the skulls, he says, of an infant and possibly an adult.",
      "He carefully places them in a ceramic rice bowl and takes a moment to imagine people dying 80 years ago as they hid in this cave during one of the fiercest battles of World War II. His hope is that the dead can be reunited with their families.",
      "The remains of some 1,400 people found on Okinawa sit in storage for possible identification with DNA testing. So far just six have been identified and returned to their families. Volunteer bone hunters and families looking for their loved ones say the government should do more to help.",
      "Gushiken says the bones are silent witnesses to Okinawa's wartime tragedy, carrying a warning to the present generation as Japan ups its defense spending in the face of tensions with China over territorial disputes and Beijing's claim to the nearby self-governing island Taiwan.",
      "\"The best way to honor the war dead is never to allow another war,\" Gushiken says. \"I'm worried about Okinawa's situation now. ... I'm afraid there is a growing risk that Okinawa may become a battlefield again.\"",
      "Island haunted by one of World War II's deadliest battles",
      "On April 1, 1945, U.S. troops landed on Okinawa during their push toward mainland Japan, beginning a battle that lasted until late June and killed about 12,000 Americans and more than 188,000 Japanese, half of them Okinawan civilians. That included students and victims of mass suicides ordered by the Japanese military, historians say.",
      "The fighting ended at Itoman, where Gushiken and other volunteer cave diggers - or \"gamahuya\" in their native Okinawan language - have found the remains of what are likely hundreds of people.",
      "Gushiken tries to imagine being in the cave during the fighting. Where would he hide? What would he feel? He makes a guess about the age of the victims, whether they died by gunshot or explosion, and puts details about the bones in a small red notebook.",
      "After the war, Okinawa remained under U.S. occupation until 1972, 20 years longer than most of Japan, and it remains host to a major U.S. military presence to this day. As Japan enjoyed a postwar economic rise, Okinawa's economic, educational and social development lagged behind.",
      "Gushiken says when he was a child growing up in Okinawa's capital, Naha, he would go out hunting bugs and find skulls still wearing helmets.",
      "A slow search for remains",
      "Nearly 80 years after the end of World War II, 1.2 million Japanese war dead are still unaccounted for. That's about half of the 2.4 million Japanese, mostly soldiers, who died during Japan's early 20th century wars.",
      "Thousands of unidentified bones have been sitting in storage for years waiting for testing that could help match them with surviving families.",
      "Gushiken says the government's DNA matching efforts have been too little and too slow.",
      "Of the estimated 188,140 Japanese killed in the Battle of Okinawa, most of their remains had been collected and placed in the national cemetery on the island, the health ministry says. Around 1,400 remains found in recent decades sit in storage. The process of identification has been painfully slow.",
      "It was only in 2003 that the Japanese government started DNA matching after requests from the families of the dead, but tests were limited to the remains found with teeth and manmade artifacts that could provide hints to their identities.",
      "In 2016, Japan enacted a law launching a remains recovery initiative to promote more DNA matching and cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense. A lear later, the government expanded the work to civilians and authorized testing on limb bones.",
      "In all, 1,280 remains of Japanese war-dead, including six on Okinawa, have been identified by DNA tests since 2003, the health ministry said. The remains of around 14,000 people are stored in the ministry mortuary for future testing.",
      "Hundreds of American soldiers remain unaccounted for. Their remains, as well as those of the Koreans mobilized by the Japanese during the war, may yet be found, Gushiken says.",
      "Locating and identifying decades-old remains have become increasingly difficult as families and relatives age, memories fade, artifacts and documents get lost, and the remains deteriorate, says Naoki Tezuka, a health ministry official.",
      "\"The progress has been slow everywhere,\" Tezuka said. \"Ideally, we hope to not just collect the remains but return them to their families.\"",
      "The burden of history",
      "Japan is undertaking an accelerating military buildup, sending more troops and weapons to Okinawa and its outer islands. Many here who have bitter memories of the Japanese army's wartime brutality view the current military buildup with wariness.",
      "Washington and Tokyo see the strong U.S. military presence as a crucial bulwark against China and North Korea, but many Okinawans have long complained about noise, pollution, aircraft accidents and crime related to American troops.",
      "Okinawa today is home to more than half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan, with the majority of U.S. military facilities on the small southern island. Tokyo has promised to relocate a U.S. Marine Corps air station that sits in a crowded town after years of friction, but Okinawans remain angry at a plan that would only move it to the island's east coast and may use the soil possibly containing the remains for construction.",
      "Gushiken says the Itoman caves should be protected from development so that younger generations can learn about the war's history, and so searchers like him can complete their work.",
      "Like him, some Okinawans say they fear the lessons of their wartime suffering are being forgotten.",
      "Tomoyuki Kobashigawa's half-sister Michiko was killed soon after she got married. He wants to apply for DNA matching to help find her. \"It's so sad ... If she would have lived, we could have been such good siblings.\"",

      "Guillermo Vieiro was 44 when he died in 1985 while descending Argentina's Tupungato lava dome, one of the highest peaks in the Americas.",
      "Then last year, his backpack was spotted on a slope by mountaineer Gabriela Cavallaro, who examined it and contacted Vieiro's daughters Guadalupe, 40, and Azul, 44.",
      "In February this year, the three set out with four other guides and two filmmakers on an 11-day journey to recover the bag from an altitude of about 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) -- close to the summit of the 6,600-meter volcanic peak.",
      "\"In my family, the word 'mountain' was always forbidden. My mother wants nothing to do with the discovery of this backpack. It's a family that has been broken by grief, by the void,\" Azul, who was just four years old when her father died, told AFP.",
      "\"It all seemed crazy to me, and I didn't want to go back to the volcano where he had died. But as the months went by... I started to loosen up, and began thinking: 'Why not?'\"",
      "Inside the backpack, the women found a jacket, a sleeping bag, a water bottle, aspirin, Vitamin C tablets, a set of knives and two rolls of film that had belonged to their father.",
      "\"Spiritually, it felt like a greeting, like: 'I'm still here, I exist. You're not alone,'\" Azul recounted.",
      "\"That slope has never been scaled again\"",
      "The experience also allowed her to learn more about a man she never got a chance to know.",
      "\"My mother never really told us who he was. We knew he had died in the mountains and that he was a mountaineer, but not much more than that. So, it was like rediscovering his story, like saying, wait... we have a father who had a life, a history. So it was like discovering him all over again.\"",
      "Photos taken from other film found inside the same backpack by Cavallaro a year earlier, showed that Vieiro and his partner Leonardo Rabal, 20, had been the first climbers to reach the top of Tupungato from its eastern side -- the most challenging route.",
      "\"That slope has never been scaled again,\" Cavallaro, who lives at the foot of Tupungato in the city of the same name, told AFP.",
      "\"What they (Vieiro and Rabal) accomplished has real historical value in Argentine and international mountaineering,\" she added.",
      "According to the Smithsonian Institution, Tupungato is a Pleistocene stratovolcano capped by a lava dome complex that is about 800,000 years old. There have been no reported eruptions there in modern history, according to Andean Geology, which noted that \"landslide and sector collapse events are likely\" on certain parts of the mountain.",
      "The bodies of Vieiro and Rabal were recovered shortly after they died.",
      "Azul and her sister said they would donate their father's belongings in an attempt to share a \"piece of Argentine mountaineering history\" with others.",
      "The journey to retrieve Vieiro's belongings come just months after another deceased climber's possessions were found on a peak in South America. Last summer, the preserved body of American mountaineer Bill Stampfl \u2014 who disappeared 22 years ago while scaling a snowy peak in Peru \u2014 was found by a climber. A hip pouch contained Stampfl's driving license, a pair of sunglasses, a camera, a voice recorder and two decomposing $20 bills. A gold wedding ring was still on the left hand.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump issued what he called a \"last warning\" to the terrorist group Hamas Wednesday to release all hostages still held in Gaza, directing a sharply worded message after the White House confirmed that he had recently dispatched an envoy for unprecedented direct talks with the terrorist group.",
      "Mr. Trump, in a statement on his Truth Social platform soon after meeting at the White House with eight former hostages, added that he was \"sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job.\"",
      "\"Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" he said. \"Only sick and twisted people keep bodies, and you are sick and twisted!\"",
      "Hamas said Thursday that the Trump threats \"encourage\" Israel to disregard the ceasefire's terms.",
      "\"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation to avoid implementing its terms,\" Hamas spokesman Hazem Qasim said in a statement.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to \"open the gates of hell\" if Hamas doesn't\u00a0return all its hostages.",
      "The pointed language from the president came after the White House said Wednesday that U.S. officials have engaged in \"ongoing talks and discussions\" with Hamas officials, stepping away from a long-held U.S. policy of not directly engaging with any U.S.-designated terrorist groups. It's the first known direct engagement between the U.S. and Hamas since the State Department designated the group a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.",
      "Confirmation of the talks in the Qatari capital of Doha came as the Israel-Hamas ceasefire hangs in the balance.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to provide details on the substance of talks, but said Mr. Trump has authorized his envoys to \"talk to anyone.\"",
      "\"Look, dialogue and talking to people around the world to do what's in the best interest of the American people is something that the president ... believes is a good-faith effort to do what's right for the American people,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt added that Israel has been consulted about the direct engagement with Hamas officials, and noted that there are \"American lives at stake.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office offered a terse acknowledgement of the U.S.-Hamas talks. \"Israel has expressed to the United States its position regarding direct talks with Hamas,\" the prime minister's office said.",
      "Egyptian and Qatari intermediaries have been serving as mediators with Hamas.",
      "Israeli officials say about 24 living hostages - including Edan Alexander, an American citizen - as well as the bodies of at least 35 others are believed to still be held in Gaza.",
      "Adam Boehler, Trump's nominee to be special envoy for hostage affairs, led the direct talks with Hamas. Boehler, founder and CEO of Rubicon Founders, a healthcare investment firm, was a lead negotiator on the Abraham Accords team during Mr. Trump's first term that strove to win broader recognition of Israel in the Arab world.",
      "The talks, which took place last month, focused mainly on the release of American hostages and a potential end of the war without Hamas in power in Gaza, according to a Hamas official who wasn't authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "The official added that no progress was made but \"the step itself is promising\" and more talks are expected. Egyptian and Qatari mediators helped arrange the talks.",
      "The direct engagement comes as continuation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire remains uncertain. Mr. Trump has signaled that he has no intentions of pushing Netanyahu away from a return to combat if Hamas doesn't agree to terms of a new ceasefire proposal, which the Israelis have billed as being drafted by U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "The new plan would require Hamas to release half its remaining hostages - the terrorist group's main bargaining chip - in exchange for a ceasefire extension and a promise to negotiate a lasting truce. Israel made no mention of releasing more Palestinian prisoners, a key component of the first phase, which expired Saturday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday welcomed eight former hostages - Iair Horn, Omer Shem Tov, Eli Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama Levy, Doron Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani - to the White House.",
      "\"The President listened intently to their heartbreaking stories,\" Leavitt said. \"The hostages thanked President Trump for his steadfast efforts to bring all of the hostages home.\"",
      "The talks between U.S. and Hamas officials were first reported by the news site Axios."

      "Zelenskyy's Feb. 28 White House visit was intended to be capped by the signing of a landmark agreement granting the U.S. hundreds of billions in potential benefits from mining Ukraine's minerals agreement. The signing was abruptly scrapped after the meeting descended into finger pointing over Russia and its unprovoked invasion of the country, and whether Zelenskyy had properly thanked the American president.",
      "Zelenskyy had previously repeatedly thanked Mr. Trump and the U.S., and continued to do so afterward. Mr. Trump's top advisers privately shared disbelief about what they viewed as Zelenskyy's badgering of the president in front of cameras.",
      "Zelenskyy has since said he's ready to get back to the negotiating table.",
      "Ratcliffe said in the interview that Mr. Trump made the decision to halt intelligence sharing.",
      "The president \"said 'let's pause.' I want to give you a chance to think about that, and you saw the response, that President Zelenskyy put out a statement saying 'I'm ready for peace, and I want Donald Trump's leadership to bring about that peace,'\" Ratcliffe said.",

    "summary": "Egypt unveiled a $53 billion Gaza reconstruction plan with broad backing that would not displace Palestinians. The White House says it ignores reality.",
    "story": [
      "Arab nations, led by Egypt, that have strongly rejected President Trump's proposal for the U.S. to \"take over\" the Gaza Strip and displace its more than 2 million Palestinian residents so the enclave can be turned into a luxury real estate development have offered an alternative plan. Leaders from the 22-nation Arab League attended a summit in Cairo Tuesday and unanimously adopted the Egyptian proposal, which does not foresee any of Gaza's residents being forced to leave during reconstruction.",
      "The Trump administration, along with its close allies in Israel, quickly rejected the plan, with the White House reiterating the president's contention that the destruction wrought on Gaza during Israel's 15-month war with Hamas has made the enclave uninhabitable.",
      "Palestinians who have spoken with CBS News in Gaza have all vehemently rejected any bid to force them from the territory, and the head of the United Nations and some others have suggested that making them leave would amount to ethnic cleansing.",
      "Hamas backed the Arab plan, but has consistently refused to disarm as part of any ceasefire agreement, something Israel considers essential.",
      "Israel and the U.S. reject the Arab Gaza plan",
      "Israel was quick to dismiss the Egyptian-made plan, with the Foreign Ministry in Tel Aviv saying in a statement that the proposal, \"continues to rely on the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA \u2014 Both have repeatedly demonstrated corruption, support for terrorism, and failure in resolving the issue.\"",
      "Speaking after the summit on Tuesday, Egypt's Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty dismissed that stance, telling reporters that \"any talks about rejecting UNRWA or rejecting the PA is just nonsense and cannot be accepted, because this represents international legitimacy, and it should be accepted.\" He accused Israel of violating international laws and U.N. resolutions and said international law must be implemented.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry accused neighboring Arab nations of having \"used Palestinians as pawns against Israel\" since the country's creation, and its statement reiterated the Netanyahu administration's backing for \"President Trump's idea.\"",
      "The ministry claimed the U.S. president's plan was \"an opportunity for the Gazans to have free choice based on their free will,\" despite Mr. Trump saying they would not be permitted to return to Gaza.",
      "U.S. National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement, meanwhile, that the Arab proposal \"does not address the reality that Gaza is currently uninhabitable and residents cannot humanely live in a territory covered in debris and unexploded ordnance.\"",
      "\"President Trump stands by his vision to rebuild Gaza free from Hamas,\" Hughes said, adding: \"We look forward to further talks to bring peace and prosperity to the region.\"",
      "In his speech, Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said he believed the time had come to find a pathway to \"a just and sustainable solution\" to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian crisis, adding: \"I firmly believe that U.S. President Trump possesses the capacity to realize this objective, aligning with our sincere aspirations to bring an end to tensions and hostilities in our region.\"",
      "Next week, at another summit in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and its Arab League partners will seek the backing of other predominantly Islamic countries for their plan. A senior European Union official was at the summit in Cairo on Tuesday, but there has been no statement from the bloc to date offering its clear backing for the Arab proposal.",
      "What is in the Arab proposal to rebuild Gaza?",
      "The Egyptian plan, as explained by Foreign Minister Abdelatty after Tuesday's summit, would involve three phases. The first would focus on urgent relief operations and initial recovery, including building 200,000 temporary housing units in Gaza.",
      "That first phase would take between six months and a year and would cost $3 billion.",
      "The second stage would involve the construction of 200,000 permanent housing units and efforts to reestablish vital infrastructure. That phase is envisioned to take about two years, with a $20 billion price tag.",
      "The final phase would add another 200,000 permanent housing units and more service facilities, including reconstructing ports and an airport over the ensuing two years, requiring roughly $30 billion.",
      "On the key question of who or what would oversee the operations and administer Gaza, which has been ruled by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas for almost two decades, Egypt's plan calls for an administrative committee comprised of independent Palestinian technocrats to manage the territory for six months, before the Palestinian Authority returns to control Gaza.",
      "The PA currently administers parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, the other, much larger Palestinian territory. It is widely unpopular among Palestinians and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently ruled out either Hamas or the PA taking control in Gaza.",
      "Abdelatty also said Egypt would train Palestinian security personnel, in Egypt, to return and help maintain security throughout the Gaza Strip, but he didn't say which phase of the proposed plan that would commence during.",
      "The foreign minister acknowledged that before any of this could happen \u2014 even if the plan or some version of it is backed by Israel, which maintains firm control over goods and people entering and exiting Gaza and is currently blocking all aid entry \u2014 there must first be a permanent ceasefire.",
      "A call for international support - and a lot of money",
      "Addressing the summit, el-Sissi called on other nations to back the roughly $53 billion plan \u2014 including financially \u2014 and to participate in a reconstruction conference Egypt is hosting next month.",
      "\"Let us unite to make the channeling of support for this fund a noble goal and a moral imperative,\" el-Sissi said, \"ensuring every Palestinian child and every Palestinian family the right to live in a safe and civilized environment, equal to that of all peoples.\"",
      "In a final statement issued by the summit attendees, the leaders called on the United Nations Security Council to send international peacekeepers \"to contribute to achieving security for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as part of enhancing the political horizon for the establishment of the Palestinian state.\"",
      "The leaders also affirmed \"the vital and irreplaceable role of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) in carrying out its mandate granted by the United Nations resolution.\"",

      "The blockade that Israel put in place on all humanitarian good entering Gaza amid a standoff with the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group Hamas over how to keep the ceasefire in Gaza going has sent humanitarian groups into overdrive. Organizations say they're trying to figure out how to distribute dwindling supplies to the most vulnerable of the enclave's roughly 2 million people, and there's fear the situation is only going to get worse.",
      "Officials in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah said Wednesday \u2014 three days into\u00a0Israel's freeze on food, fuel, medicine and other supplies entering the decimated Hamas-controlled Palestinian territory \u2014 that Israel had also cut off electricity to two desalination plants that supply around 70% of the area's residents with fresh water.",
      "The aid freeze has imperiled the tenuous progress humanitarian workers say they were making to stave off famine in Gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire that Israel and Hamas agreed to in January. That first phase ended on March 1, and it's unclear what comes next as Israel pushes for an extension of phase-one, and Hamas demands a transition two a second phase.",
      "\"Israel's decision, to block aid to over two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as Ramadan begins, is a reckless act of collective punishment, explicitly prohibited under international humanitarian law,\" the U.K.-based charity Oxfam said in a statement. \"Humanitarian aid is not a bargaining chip for applying pressure on parties, but a fundamental right of civilians experiencing urgent need in challenging and life-threatening circumstances.\"",
      "Israel says the aid blockade is aimed at pressuring Hamas to accept a proposal to extend the first phase of the ceasefire, which it says was drafted by the Trump administration. Under the proposal, Israel has demanded that Hamas hand over half of the remaining 59 hostages held in Gaza immediately, which would be a significant change in the terms initially agreed under the deal brokered by the U.S., Qatar and Egypt.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that he was prepared to increase the pressure on Hamas, and he would not rule out cutting off electricity to all of Gaza as part of that pressure campaign.",
      "Human rights and humanitarian, including Oxfam, have accused Israel for months of using starvation as a weapon of war in Gaza",
      "Aid group says cutoff will have \"catastrophic result\"",
      "After more than 16 months of war, Gaza's population is entirely dependent on trucked-in food and other aid. Most residents are displaced from their homes, and many need shelter. Fuel is needed to keep hospitals, water pumps, bakeries and telecommunications \u2014 as well as trucks delivering aid \u2014 operating.",
      "An estimated 70% of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged during the war, and there is no significant stockpile of tents or other temporary shelters in the enclave for Palestinians to rely on during the aid freeze, according to Shaina Low, communications adviser for the Norwegian Refugee Council. The aid that came in during the ceasefire's first phase was \"nowhere near enough to address all of the needs,\" she said.",
      "Noting that six infants in Gaza died from hypothermia during the first phase of the ceasefire deal, Low said, \"if it was enough, we wouldn't have had infants dying from exposure because of lack of shelter materials and warm clothes and proper medical equipment to treat them.\"",
      "\"We're trying to figure out, what do we have? What would be the best use of our supply?\" said Jonathan Crickx, chief of communication for UNICEF. \"We never sat on supplies, so it's not like there's a huge amount left to distribute.\"",
      "Crickx predicted a \"catastrophic result\" if the aid freeze continues.",
      "During the ceasefire's first phase, humanitarian agencies rushed in supplies and quickly ramped up their capabilities. Aid workers set up more food kitchens, health centers and water distribution points. With more fuel coming in to power pumps, they were able to double the amount of water drawn from wells, according to the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency, or OCHA.",
      "The U.N. and associated nongovernmental organizations brought in around 100,000 tents as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians tried to return to their homes to find them destroyed or too damaged to live in. But progress relied on the flow of aid continuing.",
      "The International Organization for Migration has 22,500 tents sitting in its warehouses in Jordan after supply trucks brought back their undelivered cargo following Israel's entry ban, Karl Baker, the agency's regional crisis coordinator, said.",

      "A placid fishing trip turned \"berserk\" for three New Zealand men when a dolphin weighing more than 900 pounds appeared to fall out of the sky before crash-landing in their small boat.",
      "No one was badly hurt when the 11-foot\u00a0bottlenose dolphin jumped aboard the open-top boat Friday, said Dean Harrison, the owner of the nearly 16-foot vessel.",
      "Harrison and two companions were fishing near the Hole in the Rock, a picturesque spot off the far north coast of New Zealand's North Island, while dolphins frolicked ahead. The men saw a shadow across the bright summer sun and heard an almighty boom \u2014 before chaos unfolded.",
      "\"This one decided to jump on board and say hello,\" Harrison said. \"One minute everything was fine and then just like lightning striking, there's a big dolphin in our boat thrashing around and breaking everything.\"",
      "The creature's flailing snapped \"every single fishing rod we had in the boat\" and severely damaged the bow as the trio clung to the sides of the vessel, said Harrison. One man had minor injuries to his arm where the juvenile male dolphin grazed his back and shoulder, but all three fishermen and the dolphin were otherwise uninjured.",
      "But returning the majestic creature to the sea was not an option for the trio due to its size.",
      "\"We looked at the dolphin still alive and breathing and we thought, we've got to start looking after him and figure out what to do,\" Harrison said. \"Because he's stuck in the boat for now, so he's coming along for the ride.\"",
      "The men alerted New Zealand's conservation agency and were directed to a boat ramp an hour away, where workers waited to help the dolphin. On the way, the trio used a hose to keep the creature wet and protected it from the sun using a damp towel depicting players from the All Blacks rugby team.",
      "On shore, members of a local M\u0101ori tribe prayed for the dolphin before it was returned to the ocean using a tractor. Helpers gave the 2-to-3-year-old creature a name: Tohu, which means \"sign\" in the M\u0101ori language.",

    "story": [
      "On the first day of China's pomp-filled National People's Congress, the yearly agenda-setting meeting of the country's rubber-stamp legislature, Beijing announced that it would ramp up its military spending by nearly $250 billion this year, an increase of more than 7%, as it continues to modernize its armed forces. Beijing has been bolstering its military rapidly while pressing, with increasing assertiveness, territorial claims over disputed islands across the South China Sea \u2014 and its claim over the democratically governed island of Taiwan.",
      "China considers Taiwan a renegade province and President Xi Jinping has vowed to reassert Beijing's control over the island for years, by force if necessary. But Taiwan has had vital backup for decades from its biggest international partner, the U.S., which is obligated under domestic American law to provide the island with sufficient means to defend itself from any aggressor.",
      "American military ships and aircraft continually ply the South China Sea's waters and skies around Taiwan, demonstrating, the U.S. military says, the right to free navigation in international space. The freedom of navigation operations have led to some tense encounters in recent years.",

      "Over the past week, Taiwan's government and many of its 23 million people have watched and considered President Trump's aggressive posturing with Ukraine, and his blowup with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last Friday in particular, with unease.",
      "\"I think these events in their totality are deeply unnerving for the people of Taiwan,\" Russell Hsiao, the executive director at the Global Taiwan Institute in Washington, D.C., told CBS News. \"This seeming about-face from the United States in its position of support for Ukraine, I think, raises some doubts among people in Taiwan whether this could potentially happen to them as well, in the heat of a battle against China \u2014 to have its most important and principal security partner essentially pull the rug from underneath them.\"",
      "Taiwan's history with the U.S., and with Trump",
      "Since 1950 \u2014 the year after communist forces won China's civil war against the Nationalists, who then fled to Taiwan and eventually established their own, democratic administration \u2014 the U.S. has sold more than $50 billion worth of weapons to Taipei, including HIMARS rocket systems, F-16 jet fighters and dozens of advanced Abrams battle tanks, according to the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.",
      "The Taiwanese government has earmarked nearly 2.5% of its 2025 budget, nearly $20 billion, for defense.",
      "But pressure is building from the Trump administration for Taiwan to do more \u2014 similar to the pressure aimed at the United Kingdom and the European Union to bolster their defense spending as the White House seeks to shift the financial burden of supporting Ukraine onto its neighbors, and to get America's NATO allies to contribute more to the alliance.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump's nominee for undersecretary of defense for policy said Taiwan should quadruple its defense spending.",
      "\"I agree with President Trump that they should be [spending] more like 10%, or at least something in that ballpark, really focused on their defense,\" nominee Elbridge Colby told the Senate Armed Services Committee.",
      "Taiwan President Lai Ching-te quickly offered a proposal to boost his administration's defense spending to over 3%, a move that would require approval by Taiwan's congress, the Legislative Yuan.",
      "Lai has not spoken directly with Mr. Trump since the American president won reelection in November, but he conveyed his congratulations through Mr. Trump's former national security advisor, Ambassador Robert O'Brien.",
      "That was in stark contrast to Lai's predecessor, Tsai Ing-wen. Mr. Trump, in the weeks just after his first election win in 2016, controversially accepted a congratulatory call from then-Taiwanese President Tsai, breaking decades of U.S. diplomatic protocol that was aimed at keeping relations with Beijing cordial.",
      "Mr. Trump's transition team said at the time that the presidents had spoken about, \"close economic, political, and security ties,\" which angered Beijing.",
      "Up until that point, no U.S. president-elect or sitting president had spoken directly with a Taiwanese leader since 1979, when Washington switched its diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to Communist Party-ruled China during a detente with the Nixon administration.",
      "Taiwan may have \"a better hand\" with Trump",
      "While the difference in their personal engagement may be some cause for concern in Taipei, Hsiao, at the Global Taiwan Institute, played down anxiety this week, using Mr. Trump's own framing of geopolitics as a game of cards, after he told Zelenskyy that Ukraine, \"does not have the cards\" to make demands for U.S. security guarantees.",
      "\"Taiwan does have a better hand in terms of what it can offer to the United States in terms of a reciprocal bilateral relationship,\" said Hsiao. \"That remains a robust economic partnership, a strong security relationship and certainly a very critically-important high-tech industry.\"",
      "Despite its size \u2014 Taiwan covers significantly less ground than West Virginia \u2014 the densely populated island is one of the United States' top trade partners. According to U.S. government data, in 2024 it was the seventh biggest, with total estimated trade worth almost $160 billion dollars.",
      "This week, with Ukraine's critical minerals deal with the U.S. hanging in unsigned-limbo, Taiwan's most important, most valuable company, TSMC, which supplies semiconductors to some of the world's biggest companies, including Nvidia, Apple and Google, agreed a new $100 billion deal with Mr. Trump to build five new semiconductor facilities in Arizona.",
      "President Trump said it would \"create thousands of jobs \u2014 many thousands of jobs, and they're high-paying jobs.\"",
      "He said the announcement would bring Taiwan's U.S. semiconductor investment to about $165 billion in total.",
      "\"We're going to produce many chips to support AI progress and to support the smartphones' progress, and we thank President Trump again for his support,\" said TSMC CEO C.C. Wei, standing side-by-side with the president at the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump has frequently accused Taiwan of \"stealing\" from the U.S. semiconductor industry, and taking American jobs.",
      "With the agreement signed, Mr. Trump said TSMC would now be immune from the 25% tariffs he is levying across the foreign semiconductor industry.",
      "The deal likely drew a sigh of relief from leaders in Taipei, but with an increasingly pushy, vastly larger and better-armed China less than 100 miles away, they are unlikely to let their guard down.",
      "\"It's very key for Taipei, its leaders, to maintain calm and [be] cool headed with regards to dealing with the Trump administration,\" Hsiao told CBS News. \"But more needs to be done in order to make sure that the U.S.-Taiwan relationship, which is of course the most important security partnership for Taiwan, remains robust and strong under the Trump administration.\"",

      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino on Wednesday accused U.S. President Donald Trump of lying when he said in his Tuesday address to a joint session of Congress that his administration was \"reclaiming\" the Panama Canal.",
      "Mr. Trump was referencing a deal announced Tuesday for a consortium led by the U.S. investment management company BlackRock Inc. to buy a controlling stake in the company held by a Hong-Kong based group that operates ports near both ends of the Panama Canal. The announcement came after the president alleged Chinese interference with operations of the critical shipping lane.",
      "Panama maintains that it has full control over the canal and that the Hong Kong-based group's operation of the ports did not amount to Chinese control over the waterway, and that therefore the sale to a U.S.-based company would not represent any U.S. \"reclaiming\" of the canal. Panama's government on Tuesday called the sale a private transaction.",
      "Mulino,\u00a0in a message posted to X on Wednesday, rejected that the deal came about because of U.S. pressure. \"I reject in the name of Panama and all Panamanians this new affront to the truth and our dignity as a nation,\" he wrote in the post translated from Spanish. He accused Mr. Trump of \"lying again.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" Mulino continued. CBS News fact-checked the president's remarks to Congress here, reviewing his claims about the Panama Canal in addition to other issues.",
      "Mr. Trump has talked about retaking the Panama Canal since his campaign, arguing that the U.S. should have never turned control over to the Panamanians and that the U.S. was being overcharged for using it. Mulino previously denied publicly the U.S. State Department's claim that his country had reached a deal to allow U.S. warships to transit the Panama Canal for free. The Panamanian leader said in early February that he had told Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that he could not set the fees to transit the canal nor exempt anyone from them, adding at the time that he was surprised the State Department had issued a statement suggesting otherwise.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Mulino around the same time and insisted that China was exerting influence over the canal's operations. The focus was the Chinese consortium running the ports. Panama rejected that China had any influence over canal operations.",
      "\"Cooperation between our governments passes through clear understandings in terms of issues of mutual interest,\" Mulino wrote. \"It doesn't have anything to do with 'reclaiming the canal' nor with tarnishing our national sovereignty.\"",
      "In a filing, CK Hutchison Holding said Tuesday that it would sell all shares in Hutchison Port Holdings and in Hutchison Port Group Holdings to the BlackRock consortium in a deal valued at nearly $23 billion, including $5 billion in debt.",
      "The deal has to be approved by Panama's government.",
      "The United States built the canal in the early 1900s as it looked for ways to facilitate the transit of commercial and military vessels between its coasts. Washington relinquished control of the waterway to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, under a treaty signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter. Mr. Trump has claimed that Carter \"foolishly\" gave the canal away.",
      "Frank Sixt, co-managing director of CK Hutchison, said in a statement that the transaction was \"the result of a rapid, discrete but competitive process in which numerous bids and expressions of interest were received.\"",

Now facing 20% tariffs on all exports to the U.S., Beijing has refused to back down \u2014 despite its own economic problems \u2014 and is hitting the U.S. with its own retaliatory tariffs.

      "It's another sign \u2014 and perhaps a more telling one than the rhetoric from the podium at the NPC \u2014 of a belief in China that the country's economy will be able to manage whatever Mr. Trump throws at it.",

      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has been one of the negotiators who spoke with Zelenskyy about the minerals agreement was asked by CBS News \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan Sunday whether the economic deal was still on the table.",
      "\"Not at present,\" he responded.",
      "Multiple sources said a deal is not finalized. And the parameters of the agreement could change because the president is now holding out for a \"bigger, better deal,\" said a person familiar with the talks, granted anonymity to speak frankly about the details of the back-and-forth.",
      "Administration officials told CBS there was no plan Tuesday afternoon for Mr. Trump or his top advisers to sign a deal. In his address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that Zelenskyy sent him a letter earlier in the day in which the Ukrainian leader offered to sign the minerals deal \"at any time that is convenient to you.\"",
      "\"Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians,\" Zelenskyy wrote in a lengthy post on\u00a0social media\u00a0Tuesday. \"My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts.\"",
      "Roughly 20% of Ukrainian land \u2014 a vast swath of the eastern Donbas region plus Crimea \u2014 is now under Russian control.

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 04 Mar 2025 15:35:38 -0500",
    "summary": "Other than Pope Francis, these are the most powerful people at the Vatican.",
    "story": [
      "For more than two weeks, eyes have been on the Vatican, awaiting news about Pope Francis' health. The pope has been at Rome's Gemelli Hospital since Feb. 14, 2025, being treated for double pneumonia and other complications.",
      "When a pope is ill, resigns or passes away, who steps in? And who else helps lead the Holy See? The Conversation U.S. asked Daniel Speed Thompson, a theologian at the University of Dayton, for some insight into Vatican City.",
      "Who are the most powerful people at the Vatican, besides the pope?",
      "The Vatican houses the central government of the Catholic Church and is also an independent city-state. The pope is both the head of the Catholic Church and head of state.",
      "In order to govern both, he has the Roman Curia, meaning \"court.\" In modern terms, the Curia is the papal bureaucracy. It is an extension of the pope's authority.",
      "In Catholic doctrine, the pope has the highest authority in the church. He can exercise it alone or with the College of Bishops, made up of all the bishops in the world. Bishops named by the pope to the office of \"cardinal\" can, if under 80 years old, vote to elect a new pope. Some cardinals, but by no means all, serve in the papal Curia in Rome.",
      "Besides the pope, curial officials who oversee important aspects of the church's political and religious life are often powerful figures. For example, the secretariat of state, headed by Cardinal Pietro Parolin, oversees relations with other countries and international organizations. It also oversees the Vatican's diplomatic corps.",
      "The Dicastery \u2014 \"department\" \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal V\u00edctor Manuel Fern\u00e1ndez, addresses questions about correct Catholic teaching on faith and morals. The Dicastery of Bishops, headed by Cardinal Robert Prevost, coordinates the nominations of new bishops around the world.",
      "All these officials work under the authority of the pope, advocating for and implementing his agenda. For example, Prevost has suggested that all Catholics should be involved in the selection of bishops. This idea is linked with Francis' call for a more \"synodal\" church: one that is less hierarchical and shaped by lay Catholics' concerns and challenges.",
      "If a pope can't fulfill his duties, who steps in?",
      "When a pope dies \u2013 or resigns, like Benedict XVI did in 2013 \u2014 the governance of the Catholic Church formally falls to the College of Cardinals. However, the authority of the college is very limited. On their own, cardinals cannot make any significant decisions concerning faith, morals and worship. Nor can they undo previous papal decisions or change church laws about electing a new pope.",
      "All the heads of the dicasteries lose their office upon the death or resignation of a pope. The College of Cardinals serves as a caretaker government whose primary purpose is to prepare for the election of the new pope and oversee day-to-day workings of the Vatican.",
      "One cardinal, known as the \"camerlengo,\" is responsible for confirming the pope's death or resignation. He then assumes control over the pope's residence and coordinates the funeral, if needed. The camerlengo also takes custody of the Vatican's property in Rome and supervises details for the upcoming conclave.",
      "The day-to-day business of the Catholic Church continues, but no big decisions can be made in the absence of a pope. The church cannot appoint new bishops, and the Vatican cannot start new diplomatic efforts.",
      "Are officials at the Vatican often nominated to be pope?",
      "Sometimes. Francis was a cardinal from Argentina before his election as pope and had not served in the Roman Curia. However, Benedict XVI, Francis' predecessor, did serve as the prefect of the Congregation \u2014 now called Dicastery \u2014 for the Doctrine of the Faith. Some recent popes served in the Curia earlier in their career but not immediately before their election.",
      "What do you wish more people understood about the Vatican?",
      "Three things. First, the Vatican is unlike any organization in the world. Its religious mission and political status rest on nearly 2,000 years of history. This complicated story provides a unique tradition that anchors the institution of the Catholic Church, but can also block the church from critical self-examination and renewal.",
      "Second, the Vatican is like every organization in the world. Vatican officials can be faithful to the highest standards of their religion, truly wishing to serve the church and the common good of humanity. But they can also be flagrantly immoral, even criminals, and careerist seekers of status or luxury. Francis has consistently called out priests and bishops who see themselves as somehow superior by virtue of their office or their ordination.",
      "Finally, compared with the massive bureaucracies of modern governments and corporations, the Vatican is relatively small and not as wealthy as it is often portrayed.",
      "Although the Curia manages a vast international organization, its resources are far closer to my own midsize Catholic university than to the U.S. government or Apple. Vatican City and the Holy See employ about 2,000 people, with an operating budget of about $835 million.",
      "Yes, the Catholic Church has wealth \u2014 and the ongoing problem of deficits and financial corruption. But the Vatican's resources pale in comparison with what a modern state or large company can muster.",

      "Vishing, short for \"voice phishing,\" is a type of cybercrime that uses phone calls to deceive individuals into revealing personal or financial information. Unlike\u00a0traditional phishing, which relies on emails or text messages, vishing leverages the power of human voice and social engineering to manipulate victims. Scammers often impersonate legitimate organizations, such as banks, tech companies, or government agencies, to gain trust and create a sense of urgency. They may ask for passwords, credit card numbers, or other sensitive details, which they then use for fraudulent purposes.",

I strongly suggest you remove your personal info from people search sites online. If you give someone your email or phone number, they might be able to find your home address through a reverse search.\u00a0While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The key to the Touchdown's appeal lies in its transformative design.\u00a0Expandable's philosophy is to create \"a space that can turn into a trailer, instead of a trailer that can turn into a space,\" emphasizing spaciousness and a seamless connection between travel and relaxation.

      "Companies that handle massive amounts of user data are often the least careful with it. Last year, the National Public Data breach\u00a0exposed 2.7 billion records. The company\u2019s entire business model was built around collecting data from public sources to create detailed user profiles for people in the U.S. and beyond. Now, another breach has surfaced, this time affecting DISA Global Solutions, an employee screening provider.",

      "What you need to know",
      "DISA Global Solutions, a company specializing in employee screening services, recently\u00a0disclosed a major data breach affecting over 3.3 million individuals. The Texas-based firm serves more than 55,000 businesses, including a third of Fortune 500 companies, offering background checks, drug and alcohol testing and compliance solutions.",
      "The breach began on Feb. 9, 2024, when an unauthorized party gained access to part of DISA\u2019s network. Shockingly, the intrusion went undetected for more than two months until the company discovered the \"cyber incident\" on April 22, 2024. Following the breach, DISA launched an internal investigation with help from third-party forensic experts to assess the damage.",
      "It's still unclear how the attack happened. DISA hasn\u2019t confirmed whether phishing, malware or another method was used. However, the fact that hackers had access for months without detection points to serious gaps in the company\u2019s monitoring systems. Adding to the concern, nearly a year passed before the public was notified, which raises serious questions about DISA\u2019s cybersecurity measures and response time.",

      "SPOTIFY PLAYLISTS ARE BEING HIJACKED TO PROMOTE PIRATED SOFTWARE AND SCAMS",
      "What data got stolen?",
      "The hackers accessed a trove of sensitive personal information, though DISA has admitted it cannot definitively confirm the full scope of the stolen data. According to filings with the attorneys general of Maine and\u00a0Massachusetts, the compromised information included Social Security numbers, financial account details (such as credit card numbers), driver\u2019s licenses and other government-issued identification documents.",
      "Given DISA\u2019s role in employee screening, the breach likely exposed data collected from background checks and drug tests, potentially including employment histories, criminal records and even health-related information. The notification to affected individuals \u2013 more than 360,000 were Massachusetts residents and 15,198 from Maine \u2013 underscored the breadth of the incident, affecting a staggering 3,332,750 people nationwide.",

      "If you\u2019ve undergone a background check or drug test through an employer or prospective employer, your data might be among the millions exposed in this breach. Here are five practical steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Monitor your financial accounts: Regularly check your bank statements, credit card transactions and credit reports for suspicious activity. The breach exposed financial details, making unauthorized transactions a real risk. Consider setting up alerts for any unusual activity.",
      "2) Enroll in credit monitoring: DISA is offering affected individuals 12 months of free credit monitoring and identity restoration services through Experian. Take advantage of this by enrolling before the June 30 deadline to keep tabs on your credit and detect potential misuse early.",
      "3) Place a fraud alert or credit freeze: Contact one of the major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) to place a fraud alert on your file, which makes it harder for thieves to open accounts in your name. For stronger protection, consider a credit freeze, which restricts access to your credit report entirely.",
      "4) Be wary of phishing attempts and install strong antivirus: With personal details in the hands of cybercriminals, expect an uptick in targeted scams. Avoid clicking links or sharing information in unsolicited emails, texts or calls claiming to be from DISA or related entities.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Invest in data removal services:\u00a0In light of these recurring data breaches, taking proactive steps to protect your personal information is crucial. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The DISA Global Solutions data breach isn\u2019t just an apparent mistake. It seems to be a complete failure. A company that handles sensitive data for millions, including Fortune 500 clients, let hackers lurk in its systems for more than two months. Worse, it took 10 months to tell the public. Now, 3.3 million people are left dealing with the fallout while DISA offers a token year of credit monitoring. The real cost is years of potential identity theft and financial damage.",

Security researchers also observed 3.9 billion credentials circulating in lists that appear to originate from infostealer logs.",
      "Infostealer malware is expected to remain a persistent threat in 2025. With malware-as-a-service platforms on the rise and infostealers becoming more sophisticated, cybercriminals will likely continue relying on them as a primary tool for stealing credentials and infiltrating systems.",

      "As infostealer malware continues to grow in sophistication, taking proactive steps to protect your data is more important than ever. Here are four key ways to safeguard yourself from threats like FrigidStealer, Lumma and other credential-stealing malware.",
      "1) Beware of fake software updates: One of the most common infection methods is through deceptive browser update prompts. Never download updates from pop-ups or random websites. Instead, always update your software directly from official sources, such as the App Store or the application\u2019s official website. If in doubt, check out my\u00a0detailed guide on how to keep your device and software updated.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a secondary verification method, such as a one-time code sent to your phone. Use 2FA for all critical accounts, including email, banking and cloud services.",
      "3) Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "4)\u00a0Be cautious with downloads and links. Use a strong antivirus: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "HERE\u2019S WHAT RUTHLESS HACKERS STOLE FROM 110 MILLION AT&T CUSTOMERS",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "As the digital landscape evolves, so do the nasty threats we face. FrigidStealer is just the latest reminder that no platform, not even macOS, is immune to the growing sophistication of cybercriminals. With infostealers like Lumma, StealC and Redline already compromising millions of devices and billions of credentials in 2024, the rise of AI-driven attacks and social engineering scams signals a challenging road ahead.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about how lab-grown muscles power a biohybrid hand for scalable prosthetics and research.",
      "A groundbreaking development has come from researchers at the University of Tokyo and Waseda University in Japan. They've created a biohybrid hand, a fusion of lab-grown muscle tissue and mechanical engineering, capable of gripping and making gestures. This innovation paves the way for a new generation of robotics with diverse applications.",

      "Bridging biology and robotics",
      "While soft robots and advanced prosthetics are becoming increasingly common, the combination of living tissue and machines is still relatively rare. The field of biohybrid science is in its infancy, with only a few examples, such as artificial fish powered by human heart cells or robots using locust ears for hearing. This new biohybrid hand represents a significant step forward in the practical application of this technology.",

      "The secret ingredient: MuMuTAs",
      "So, how did they do it? The team started by growing muscle fibers in the lab. Recognizing that these delicate tissues wouldn't be strong enough on their own, they bundled them into what they call \"multiple tissue actuators,\" or MuMuTAs. \"Our key achievement was developing the MuMuTAs,\" said Shoji Takeuchi from the University of Tokyo.",
      "Takeuchi is the co-author of a study describing the creation that was published in the journal\u00a0Science Robotics. Shoji explained that creating MuMuTAs was their key achievement. By rolling the thin strands of muscle tissue like a sushi roll, they ensured enough contractile force and length to drive the hand's movements.",

      "One of the most remarkable findings was that the biohybrid hand experienced fatigue, just like a real human hand. After 10 minutes of use, the force of the tissue declined, but it recovered within an hour of rest. This observation highlights the lifelike properties of the engineered muscle tissue.",
      "Biohybrid hand (Science Robotics) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and future directions",
      "Takeuchi and his team acknowledge that their creation is currently a proof of concept. During the study, the hand was floated in a liquid to minimize friction, and adding elastic or more MuMuTAs would solve the issue of the segments floating back to a neutral position after being flexed. However, by bundling the tissue together, they overcame a major hurdle in scaling up biohybrid devices. Previously, such devices were limited to about a centimeter in size.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The Zacks Investment breach first came to light in late January 2025 when a hacker known as \"Jurak\" claimed on BreachForums that they had gained access to Zacks' systems as early as June 2024.",
      "According to the hacker, they obtained domain administrator privileges for Zacks' active directory, a critical network security component, allowing them to steal source code for Zacks.com and 16 other websites, including internal tools, along with user account data. The stolen information was then put up for sale on hacker forums, with samples offered for a small cryptocurrency payment to prove authenticity, as reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer.",
      "Further investigation confirmed the breach occurred in June 2024, exposing 12 million unique email addresses and other personal data. The fact that the attacker managed to gain domain admin access suggests a highly sophisticated attack, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Zacks' network security.",

The leaked data includes email addresses, IP addresses, names, phone numbers, physical addresses, usernames, and unsalted SHA-256 hashed passwords.",
      "This kind of information can be misused for phishing, identity theft, credential stuffing, harassment, SIM swapping and even physical threats. Alarmingly, 93% of the leaked email addresses had already been exposed in previous breaches, making reused passwords an even bigger problem. The use of unsalted SHA-256 hashes \u2014 widely considered outdated \u2014 only adds to the risk, making it easier for attackers to crack passwords and compromise accounts.",

      "1. Beware of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0After a data breach, scammers often use the stolen data to craft convincing phishing messages. These can come via email, text or phone calls, pretending to be from trusted companies. Be extra cautious about unsolicited messages with links asking for personal or financial details, even if they reference recent orders or transactions. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "2. Invest in identity theft protection:\u00a0Given the exposure of personal data, such as names, addresses and order details, investing in identity theft protection services can provide an extra layer of security. These services monitor your financial accounts and credit report for any signs of fraudulent activity, alerting you to potential identity theft early on. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on accounts:\u00a0Enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. Even if hackers get hold of your login credentials, they won\u2019t be able to access your accounts without the second verification step, such as a code sent to your phone or email. This simple step can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive personal information.",
      "4. Update your passwords: Change passwords for any accounts that may have been affected by the breach, and use unique, strong passwords for each account. Consider using a\u00a0password manager. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Remove your personal data from public databases: If your personal data was exposed in this breach, it\u2019s crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

When we perform everyday tasks, our fingers move in coordinated patterns called \"postural synergies.\" These synergies are fundamental to how we grasp and manipulate objects. The team, led by Antonio Bicchi and Dario Farina, developed a method that integrates these postural synergies with the analysis of electrical signals from the nervous system. By decoding the activity of spinal motoneurons (the nerve cells that control muscle movement), they can predict the hand movements a user intends to make. This information is then used to control the prosthetic hand.",

One of the most exciting features of this new prosthetic hand is its ability to perform in-hand manipulation.

      "\"Bryan C. Kohberger, by and through his attorneys of record\u2026 hereby moves this Court to strike the death penalty as a sentencing option in his case because Mr. Kohberger\u2019s autism spectrum disorder (ASD) reduces his culpability, negates the retributive and deterrent purposes of capital punishment, and exposes him to the unacceptable risk that he will be wrongfully convicted and sentenced to death,\" Anne Taylor wrote in a newly unsealed, 28-page court filing.",
      "She argued that repetitive behaviors such as rocking in place or Kohberger's failure to make eye contact would be perceived by jurors as \"strange, out-of-control, and even disrespectful of such a solemn proceeding\" or interpreted as guilt or shame. She said her client had been examined by Dr. Rachel Orr, who found that Kohberger's autism has a \"significant impact on his daily life.\"",

      "Kohberger, 30, was studying for a Ph.D. in criminology at Washington State University at the time of the crimes.",
      "He is accused of a meticulously planned attack that left four students dead at the University of Idaho, just 10 miles away. They were 21-year-old best friends Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, their 20-year-old housemate Xana Kernodle, and her boyfriend, Ethan Chapin, also 20.",

      "\"Because of his autism others may see Bryan as not recognizing social cues, continuing to talk to others when the conversation would naturally end, over-focusing on a topic or hobby of interest or talking about the same topic repeatedly, using a complicated vocabulary, or seeming self-absorbed,\" she wrote. \"Bryan\u2019s autism is also accompanied by obsessive-compulsiveness, and an eating disorder.\"",

      "The hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Wednesday is expected to also include testimony from Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson and Denver Mayor Mike Johnston.",
      "Unlike the others, Adams is a former police captain and has publicly said he plans to work with the Trump administration to fight migrant crime.",
      "\"Criminal alien predators should not be free to roam our communities,\" said Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican and the committee's chair. \"State and local governments that refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement efforts should not receive a penny of federal funding. President Trump and his administration are rightfully taking action against sanctuary cities.\"",

      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams (AP/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)",
      "Adams' office did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but of the four Democrat mayors invited to the hearing, he has publicly appeared the most open to President Donald Trump's crackdown on criminal illegal aliens.",
      "\"Mayor Adams has the upper hand, and why is that? Because he wore the uniform and the boots of the officers that go out there every single day,\" said Joseph Imperatrice, a police sergeant and the founder of Blue Lives Matter. \"He has that side and that experience to be able to say, \u2018I did this. I know what needs to be done to keep people safe. And as the mayor, my No. 1 responsibility is public safety. So I need all the tools in this chest to do my job properly.\u2019\"",
      "For that reason, Imperatrice told Fox News Digital, he expects Adams to offer a different perspective from the left-wing peers from Boston, Chicago and Denver.",
      "\"As long as he sticks to that, and he sticks to the basics of what he knows from actually doing it, he can make some very valid points,\" he said.",

      "BORDER CZAR TOM HOMAN MEETS WITH BLUE CITY LEADER FOR CRACKDOWN ON CRIMINAL ALIENS",
      "City police leaders last year blamed criminal illegals for a \"wave of migrant crime\" primarily linked to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which established a foothold in the Big Apple's shelter system. In particular, bail reform policies that let low-level offenders back on the streets were repeatedly blamed for the rash of crimes.",
      "\"When there's no accountability, and they're continuously doing crimes and continuously creating new crime victims, that's a problem,\" Imperatrice said. \"People living in the city don't want to feel like the crime is out of control. They want to feel that they could wake up [and] go on the subway or walk on a city street and not have to look over their shoulder.\"",
      "Chris Swecker, a former assistant FBI director, said Adams' colleagues are hurting public safety in their own cities by feuding with Trump over immigration enforcement.",
      "\"Cartels are powerful, and they infiltrate into any city where there's lax law enforcement,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Fentanyl is the new crack cocaine. It is lethal, plentiful and highly destructive to neighborhoods. These drugs have a [disparate] impact on the less wealthy and minorities. Drugs in general drive crime. It's a fact.\"",
      "The same cities are also withholding crime statistics from the FBI to distort public perception, he alleged.",
      "Adams, who often butted heads with the Biden-Harris administration over an open border policy that flooded his city with more than 200,000 unvetted migrants, has already flagged that he intends to cooperate more with the Trump administration than some of his colleagues and predecessors.",

      "\"ICE agents would specifically be focused on assisting the correctional intelligence bureau in their criminal investigations, in particular those focused on violent criminals and gangs,\" Adams said at the time.",
      "That's a commonsense move, according to Imperatrice, because regulations that prevent law enforcement agencies from working together do nothing to improve public safety.",
      "\"There are legitimate arguments that could be made that city police departments investigating crimes don\u2019t want to be viewed as immigration enforcement in order to gain trust and get information about crimes in immigrant communities,\" said Thad Bingel, a former Department of Homeland Security official from the George W. Bush administration. \"But no one is asking local police departments to conduct immigration raids or go out and enforce federal immigration laws, which is a federal responsibility of DHS.\"",
      "ICE is conducting flights to remove illegal immigrants from the U.S. and back to their home countries. (ICE Seattle)",
      "Sheltering Biden-era migrants cost New York taxpayers about $7 billion, Adams has said, with little relief from the former occupant of the White House.",
      "Adams said in January that the city would work with ICE as part of Trump's nationwide crackdown on criminal illegals, even with sanctuary laws in place in the state and city.",
      "\"There ought to be a commonsense middle ground here that if you expect federal grants for your city, then at a bare minimum, when you have a criminal alien in custody for a crime, someone wanted by ICE, that you contact ICE and hold them in custody for some small amount of time until they can be picked up by federal officer,\" Bingel said. \"That is just common sense and a basic level of expected cooperation.\"",

      "\"It's very important that [in] today's day and age, we get past this Democrat and Republican nonsense and get on the same page, do things for the right reasons for the people that are asking for it,\" Imperatrice said. \"People want public safety. They want a good quality of life, and they don't care if it's a Democrat or Republican that enacts it.\"",

      "At the same time, the broader political future of Gaza remains uncertain. Al-Omari noted that despite the ongoing reconstruction discussions, the primary concern for Arab leaders is how to navigate Trump\u2019s unpredictable stance on Gaza. \"Frankly, the main thinking in Arab governments right now is how to engage in a covert process with Trump to walk him back from this.

    "story": [
      "Some U.S. allies are considering scaling back the intelligence they share with Washington in response to the Trump administration\u2019s conciliatory approach to Russia,\u00a0four sources with\u00a0direct\u00a0knowledge of\u00a0the discussions told NBC News.",
      "The allies are weighing the move because of concerns about safeguarding foreign assets whose identities could inadvertently be revealed, said the sources, who included a foreign official.",
      "Every intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities. Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.",
      "The allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and members of the so-called Five Eyes spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are examining how to possibly revise current protocols for sharing intelligence to take the Trump administration\u2019s warming relations with Russia into account, the sources said",
      "\u201cThose discussions are already happening,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.",
      "No decision or action has been taken, however, the sources said.",
      "The review is part of a wider examination of the spectrum of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said.",
      "Historic implications",
      "Though the extent of a U.S. policy change toward Russia remains unclear, allies are weighing the possible implications of what could be a historic shift, a Western official said.",
      "Asked about allies\u2019 possibly limiting what they share with the United States, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council said President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump is \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about America\u2019s adversaries.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has unrivaled intelligence capabilities which is exactly why intelligence sharing initiatives such as the Five Eyes exist,\u201d spokesman Brian Hughes said in an email.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is\u00a0clear-eyed on all threats our adversaries pose to our national security and he will work with any ally or partner who understands the dangerous world inherited after the disastrous Biden years,\" he added. \"On Biden\u2019s watch, we had the war in Ukraine, the surrender in Afghanistan, and the slaughter of the innocents\u00a0on October 7th.\u201d",
      "Administration officials and some Republican lawmakers have defended Trump\u2019s handling of Russia as a tactic designed to bring Moscow to the negotiating table and clinch a peace deal that would end a destabilizing war in Europe. But distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran KGB officer, remains high among U.S. allies.",
      "Publicly, longtime U.S. allies downplayed the issue. The United Kingdom, the most important U.S. intelligence partner, said it had no plans to reduce intelligence cooperation with the United States.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the UK\u2019s closest ally and we will continue to cooperate closely on defence, intelligence and security matters,\u201d a British government spokesperson said in an email. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is totally untrue.\u201d",
      "The Canada Security Intelligence Service said in a statement that it has strong relationships with numerous U.S. agencies that are \u201clong-standing and resilient.\u201d",
      "It added, \u201cCanada deeply values its partnership with the United States, and we believe that it is in the strategic interest of both countries to continue our strong national security cooperation.\u201d",
      "An Israeli official also praised its alliance with the U.S., saying \"Cooperation between Israel and the United States on every level, including the sharing of crucial intelligence data, is as strong and solid as ever.\"",
      "Officials from New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Some officials in allied countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, played down the idea that  Trump\u2019s policies on Russia would disrupt information sharing that dates back decades. They noted that intelligence can be shared in ways that protect sources and methods.",
      "But some former U.S. intelligence officers say they are concerned that the Trump administration may opt to scale back intelligence collection aimed at Russia, as the U.S. may no longer see Russia as a top threat.",
      "The administration, for example, has indicated it may place a higher priority on efforts to counter drug cartels from Mexico and other countries in the region. Already, the Defense Department has deployed more resources to the southern border, including a team of analysts. And the CIA has launched drone surveillance flights over Mexico as part of that effort.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision this week to pause intelligence assistance to Ukraine, along with military aid, has reinforced concerns among  allies. The intelligence cooperation with Kyiv \u2014 which has developed since Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 \u2014 has benefited both Washington and Kyiv, former officials say, with Ukraine providing valuable insights about Russia.",
      "In weighing whether to dial back some intelligence sharing, the Five Eyes allies \u2014 the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2014 and other U.S. partners would have to take into account risks to their own national security if cooperation with Washington were reduced.",
      "Cybersecurity concerns",
      "But recent moves by the Trump administration regarding cybersecurity have also fueled concerns about the administration\u2019s engagement with Moscow.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month\u00a0ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, NBC News has reported. It is unclear how long the order will last.",
      "And in a\u00a0speech at a U.N. working group on cybersecurity\u00a0last month, a senior State Department official, Liesyl Franz, made no mention of Russia as a top cyber threat and cited only China and Iran.",
      "For years, including during Trump\u2019s first term, Republican and Democratic administrations have described Russia as one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threats to American cybersecurity.",
      "With Trump and his deputies echoing some of Russia\u2019s talking points about the Ukraine war and indicating they hope to expand U.S. relations with Moscow, former intelligence officials say the administration may even share some sensitive information with Moscow.",
      "Several former U.S. intelligence officers said they and their colleagues still in government are deeply concerned about the possible implications of the administration\u2019s shift toward Russia, in which Moscow may no longer be treated as an adversary.",
      "\u201cPeople are very worried,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "Formidable alliance",
      "The Five Eyes alliance is arguably the most formidable espionage alliance in the world.\u00a0The intelligence cooperation among its members is deeply embedded, dating to the 1940s, and officials have credited it with helping counter the Soviets during the Cold War and foiling terrorist plots in recent decades.",
      "The sharing of satellite imagery and eavesdropping intelligence among alliance members is extensive, highly integrated and \u201cnearly automatic,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "Unwinding the technical side of the alliance\u2019s cooperation would be complicated and difficult, former officials said. A likelier scenario could have allied governments withholding some intelligence from human sources or analyses that could cause friction with the White House, several former intelligence officials said.",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said he was deeply concerned by the Trump administration\u2019s \u201crapid pivot towards the Kremlin\u201d and media reports that U.S. Cyber Command was pulling back on cyber operations against Russia.",
      "\u201cRussia is an adversary and, as always, looking for opportunities to sow discord and make trouble for Americans and for the government, so any stand-down or pullback of our operations could be catastrophic,\u201d Crow said in an interview.",
      "The administration\u2019s actions on cybersecurity have fueled speculation that Washington and Moscow may have come to an informal understanding to pull back from aggressive digital operations to reduce tensions and open the way for more diplomacy.",
      "It is possible that the Trump administration and Russia have agreed to \u201ca cyber d\u00e9tente,\u201d said Emily Harding, a former intelligence official. But Harding and other former intelligence officials warned that in past, attempts by the United States to forge limited cooperation with Russia, the Kremlin has proved to be an unreliable partner.",
      "\u201cThat sounds good in theory,\u201d said Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. \u201cI think the next question is whether you think Russia would actually stick to it.\u201d",
      "A hub for cybercriminals",
      "A major hitch to any cyber d\u00e9tente with Moscow is Russia\u2019s status as a hub of cybercriminals who target Americans. Russia does not extradite its citizens, and it has largely refused to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies when they identify hackers attacking American businesses, hospitals and government networks.",
      "Of particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment.",
      "Known attacks on the U.S. public sector frequently tied to Russia have steadily increased each year through 2024,\u00a0according to a survey\u00a0conducted by the cybersecurity company Emsisoft.",
      "The cybersecurity insurer Coalition\u00a0found in a report\u00a0published in October that ransomware attacks around the globe cost companies  $353,000 on average last year. In some instances, ransomware gangs have alluded to ties to Russian intelligence.",
      "Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals\u00a0who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia.",
      "\u201cAny engagement the Trump administration has to normalize relations around cyber has got to take into account the economic terrorism that Russia engages in via ransomware gangs,\u201d Reiner said. \u201cThat has to be a factor in any overall negotiation.\u201d",
      "Previous U.S. presidents from both parties have tried to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia and explored sharing intelligence about common threats with Moscow. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration\u00a0with Russia on terrorism threats. But the effort \u201cwent nowhere fast,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "The Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials.",
      "In an op-ed in 2020 in The Washington Post, former CIA officer John Sipher and other former colleagues recounted how attempts to increase cooperation with Moscow\u2019s spy services repeatedly failed.",
      "\u201cInside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGood intentions from the U.S. side have proved time and again to have been futile in improving relations.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Elon Musk met with Senate Republicans for nearly two hours in a closed-door lunch meeting Wednesday, seeking to reassure them amid voter anxiety over the sweeping cuts his Department of Government Efficiency is making.",
      "They discussed a \u201crescission\u201d package that the White House could send to Congress to codify his cuts through a measure that can get around the 60-vote hurdle in order to get around legal challenges to the administration\u2019s power to act unilaterally.",
      "\u201cTo me, it\u2019s ephemeral now. I love all the stuff they\u2019re doing, but we got to vote on it. So my message to Elon was let\u2019s get over the impoundment idea, and let\u2019s send it back as a rescission package,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., told reporters. \u201cBecause then what we have to do is lobby to get to 51 senators or 50 senators to cut the spending.\u201d",
      "Multiple senators said Musk was surprised to learn there was a viable legislative pathway to making DOGE\u2019s cuts permeant. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Musk was \u201cso happy\u201d when he heard the news, telling reporters that Musk pumped his fists and danced.",
      "He backed the idea Paul raised.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time for the White House now to go on offense. We\u2019re losing altitude. You know, we started off straight good,\u201d Graham said. \u201cWe need to get back in the game on offense. And the way you can regain altitude is to take the work product, get away from the personalities and the drama, take the work product and vote on it.\u201d",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., organized the lunch meeting as Musk\u2019s activities loom as a sticking point in negotiations to keep the government open and prevent a shutdown March 14. Democrats need to sign off on such a bill, and they have accused the White House of usurping Congress\u2019s power by unilaterally slashing spending directed by law.",
      "Hours earlier, the Supreme Court ruled to reject the Trump administration\u2019s request to freeze billions in foreign aid. Paul said his message to Musk was to \u201cget over the impoundment idea\u201d and work with Congress to make DOGE\u2019s spending cuts permanent.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said there were \u201ca lot of numbers tossed around\u201d in the meeting. But he said Musk didn\u2019t give Republican senators an overall dollar figure for how much he expects DOGE to save or how much money would be cut in a potential rescission package sent to Congress.",
      "At a meeting with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles last week, several GOP senators raised concerns about being out of the loop on DOGE\u2019s work. Republican lawmakers in both chambers have faced heated town halls and pushback from voters who are negatively affected by recent federal layoffs and cuts.",
      "Though he ignored shouted questions from reporters walking in and out of the room, Musk fielded an array of questions from Republican senators inside \u2014 and even gave them his personal cellphone number, said Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D.",
      "\u201cAll we hear is about the savings or the cutting. They don\u2019t hear about him wanting to make people more productive, systems more productive, and have them in jobs where they actually do better,\u201d Hoeven said after the meeting. \u201cAnd give better service. And that\u2019s the part people don\u2019t hear about.\u201d",
      "Hoeven said Musk should consider giving his number to Democratic senators, as well, and engaging in a dialogue with them.",
      "\u201cYeah, might be worth a try,\u201d Hoeven said.",
      "Musk also met with House Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday evening. He told reporters his message was related to the \u201copportunity to improve expenditures in the government.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome of our members are concerned of how it\u2019s gone a little bit,\u201d Rep. Aaron Bean, R-Fla., co-chair of the House\u2019s Congressional DOGE Caucus, said of Musk's efforts before the meeting. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s exciting. I think the president laid out a plan last night.\u201d",
      "The White House has also stepped up its outreach to Congress about government funding. Trump met with a group of conservative hard-liners at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, while Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought joined the weekly House Freedom Caucus meeting Monday to sell members on a yearlong continuing resolution.",
      "After the meeting, Trump urged Republicans to pass a continuing resolution through September.",
      "\"Conservatives will love this Bill, because it sets us up to cut Taxes and Spending in Reconciliation, all while effectively FREEZING Spending this year,\u00a0and allowing us to continue our work to, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. VERY IMPORTANT \u2014 Let\u2019s get this Bill done!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has been working to persuade conservatives to support a yearlong stopgap spending bill that doesn\u2019t codify DOGE cuts. Johnson attended a conservative Republican Study Committee lunch Wednesday and made the case that they need more time to tally up all the cuts.",
      "Study committee chairman August Pfluger, R-Texas, told reporters after the lunch: \u201cThe speaker gave the reality of the situation. ... The reality is that this is really the only option for us. I don\u2019t think we know all the information yet, and we certainly won\u2019t know it before March 14. We do want to capture those [DOGE] savings. But this gives us the opportunity to continue to negotiate those specific bills.\u201d",
      "And there are signs that the usual pockets of opposition are melting.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., the chair of the House Freedom Caucus, predicted after the meeting with Trump that they would be able to pass a yearlong stopgap funding bill with the support of only Republicans.",
      "It\u2019s a tall order \u2014 Republicans have a majority of 218-214, meaning they can lose only one vote to pass a bill without Democrats. Scores of GOP lawmakers routinely vote against government funding bills. And one, Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., is already firmly against the idea of a continuing resolution.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll vote against a clean CR that funds everything in 2025 at 2024 levels,\u201d Massie said Tuesday on X."

      "The backlash was swift. Local and national organizations that support women and sexual assault victims issued rare public criticisms of their allies, accusing them of abandoning trans victims, who face high rates of sexual violence, and urged other groups to \u201chold the line.\u201d",
      "The conflict exposed a sharp divide in the ecosystem of nonprofit groups that work to address sexual violence, many of which rely heavily on government funding to operate. Leaders of such groups say they feel pressured to choose between protecting grants they need to serve people in crisis and taking a stand for vulnerable members of their constituency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s thrown a lot of chaos into a sector that\u2019s already \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 grossly underfunded,\u201d said Emily Miles, executive director of the NYC Alliance Against Sexual Assault. \u201cI can have empathy for difficult decisions organizations are having to make right now while also holding them to account for survivors who need their assistance.\u201d",
      "Shortly after the executive orders were signed, the Office of Management and Budget instructed the Justice Department, among other agencies, to review its programs for compliance. A spreadsheet provided by the OMB\u00a0included roughly two dozen Justice Department programs that dole out more than half a billion dollars combined to combat sexual violence.",
      "That, along with reports that the Trump administration is using keywords that include \u201csex,\u201d \u201ctrauma\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d to identify science grants to cut, worried many nonprofit groups.",
      "White House deputy press secretary Harrison Fields did not address questions about how the groups were responding to the executive orders but reiterated the administration\u2019s commitment to same-sex services for victims of sexual violence.",
      "In recent weeks, the Justice Department\u2019s Office on Violence Against Women has removed all grant applications and has not explained why. The department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cOn the horizon, that\u2019s the big question mark about what\u2019s going to happen to those funding opportunities,\u201d Miles said.",
      "Yolanda Edrington, CEO of Respect Together, the umbrella organization of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center and the Pennsylvania Coalition to Advance Respect, said more than 90% of the National Sexual Violence Resource Center\u2019s funding comes from state and federal government grants. Losing it could mean laying off staff members and not being able to provide services like legal counseling for victims.",
      "But after it removed references to LGBTQ victims, the organization quickly reversed course, restored them and issued a public apology Feb. 20, calling it \u201ca fear-based decision to the executive orders.\u201d",
      "In an interview, Edrington said the group was wrong to cave in to the administration so quickly. \u201cWe know exactly who we are and who we should represent, and we failed at that. I don\u2019t want to mince words with that at all,\u201d she said.",
      "Edrington said she recently participated in a call with nearly two dozen other nonprofit anti-violence groups in which they discussed \u201cwhich one of us can take the heat and be the loudest\u201d while withstanding a potential loss of federal funding. They did not come to a decision.",
      "Emily May, a co-founder and the president of Right To Be, a nonprofit anti-harassment organization, said her group relies on the federal government for at least 10% of its funding. It provides workplace culture training to several federal agencies and has already received word that two of them are unlikely to renew their contracts.",
      "\u201cEverybody is incredibly aware everything you say or do can put a target on your back, and that can be incredibly scary,\u201d May said. \u201cBut the target is already on our back.\u201d",
      "Feeling that pressure, RAINN \u2014 which runs federally funded sexual assault hotlines, among other programs \u2014 removed its inclusion policy and pages expressing support for LGBTQ survivors. It also sent an email to everyone in its speakers bureau Feb. 7 saying it had unpublished victims\u2019 stories, along with videos and social posts, in part to comply with federal guidance. The organization would be in touch with victims, it added, to see whether they \u201cwould like to update and republish\u201d their stories.",
      "Jennifer Simmons Kaleba, a RAINN spokeswoman, said federal agencies instructed the organization to change its website. She declined to offer specifics or identify which government offices advised it to remove LGBTQ-related content.",
      "For Ethan Levine, an activist and member of RAINN\u2019s speakers bureau, who is transgender, RAINN's removal of the survivors' stories was insulting. \u201cI felt cast aside,\u201d he said. He felt the group was asking him to update his story \u201cto make it more palatable in this moment\u201d and hoped that RAINN would follow the National Sexual Violence Resource Center\u2019s lead and reverse its decision \u2014 or at least explain it further.",
      "\u201cIf the biggest sexual assault organization in the U.S. is not willing to stand up, then what message does that send to smaller organizations?\u201d he asked.",
      "Simmons Kaleba said RAINN's mission has not changed. \u201cAny survivor can come to us as their authentic selves, and they\u2019ll be safely received \u2014 so we do support every survivor of sexual assault,\u201d she said. \u201cThat said, not everyone will support what we\u2019ve had to do to continue our crisis services, and that\u2019s a very reasonable reaction.\u201d",
      "On Feb. 20, as backlash mounted, the group sent an email saying that \u201cRAINN stands with ALL survivors\u201d and that it remains \u201csteadfast in this mission,\u201d urging supporters to sign a petition of support. It did not explain its decision to remove language from its site.",
      "Sexual Violence Center, a Minnesota-based organization supporting rape victims, condemned RAINN in a statement last week and urged it to use its \u201cconsiderable influence\u201d to push back. The post was shared by Christian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women, who warned the groups not to become \u201ccomplicit\u201d with the administration.",
      "For Miles, of the NYC Alliance, RAINN\u2019s decision to quickly comply with the Trump administration\u2019s guidance put pressure on smaller groups to follow suit.",
      "\u201cNow is the time we have to show a little bravery, and we need to be banding together,\u201d Miles said. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way we are going to sustain this.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to have members of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza killed if hostages are not immediately released.",
      "\"'Shalom Hamas' means Hello and Goodbye \u2014 You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cI have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,\u201d he added. \u201cAlso, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\u201d",
      "The White House said in a statement that Trump met Wednesday with eight hostages released from Gaza: Iair\u00a0Horn, Omer\u00a0Shem Tov, Eli\u00a0Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama\u00a0Levy, Doron\u00a0Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, saying Israel had been consulted.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem responded to Trump's comments, telling Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu Agency \"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation not to implement its terms.\"",
      "\"There is an agreement that was signed and Washington was a mediator in it, which includes the release of all prisoners in 3 stages,\" Qassem added, \"and Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while Israel is evading the second stage.\"",
      "The six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It is the first time the United States has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the United States and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included Hamas\u2019 releasing more hostages in return for Israel's withdrawing from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israel recently approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the United States will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The Biden administration announced initial ceasefire in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

      "Stocks recorded significant gains Wednesday amid a volatile trading day that largely settled after President Donald Trump\u00a0granted U.S. automakers a one-month reprieve on new 25% duties imposed on Canada and Mexico.",
      "The S&P 500 closed up 1.1%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq climbed 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained nearly 500 points, or 1.1%.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had spoken with the Big 3 American automakers \u2014 Ford, GM and Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) \u2014\u00a0and granted them a one-month exemption on paying the 25% duties on autos produced in their Canadian or Mexican facilities.",
      "Leavitt also said Trump was open to providing additional exemptions.",
      "Earlier in the day, Trump had indicated Canada\u2019s efforts to tackle drug and migrant flows continued to be insufficient to allow him to ease the tariffs entirely. In posts on his Truth Social platform, he said that after having spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, he had decided that the improvements Trudeau mentioned toward halting fentanyl and undocumented people from entering the United States were \u201cnot good enough\u201d to lift the duties.",
      "And in his address to Congress on Tuesday night, he indicated he would not relent on his tariffs scheme.",

      "Trump is set to speak with Mexico\u2019s Claudia Sheinbaum on Thursday.",
      "The uncertainty Trump's approach has generated continues to shake markets. Even with Wednesday's recovery, the S&P 500 is still down 3.6% over the past month, and it remains essentially flat on net since Trump won the election in November.",
      "Trump has acknowledged there could be difficulties along the way as he establishes his tariffs regime.",
      "Shortly before markets opened, ADP reported that private-sector job creation slowed in February, with companies adding just 77,000 workers, far below the 186,000 jobs added in January and the 148,000 Dow Jones consensus estimate.\u00a0Education and health services had some of the weakest job growth last month, while manufacturing, construction and leisure and hospitality showed strength, the data showed.",
      "In his address to Congress, Trump told farmers that there \u201cmay be a little bit of an adjustment period\u201d and that they \u201cwill probably have to bear with me again.\u201d",
      "\u201cTariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it\u2019s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a little disturbance, but we\u2019re OK with that. It won\u2019t be much.\u201d",
      "Businesses including automakers, alcohol producers and major retailers, like Target, have warned that the added costs for companies to import goods from Canada and Mexico will have wide-ranging implications across the American economy and lead to higher prices for consumers.",
      "Tariffs are paid by the U.S.-based company importing the goods into the country. Those companies can pass the added costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices, absorb the tariffs by cutting costs elsewhere or take a hit on profits.",
      "Uncertainty around tariffs on Mexico and Canada has been looming for months after Trump first raised the threat shortly after his election. Last month, he said he would enact tariffs on the two countries on Feb. 4, only to announce he was delaying the move by a month the day before they set to be collected. This week, Trump said the countries hadn\u2019t done enough over the past month to stop the flow of fentanyl, and the United States began collecting the tariffs Tuesday at midnight."

      "The torment inflicted by the seven people accused in the kidnapping, described in an 11-count indictment filed in Ontario County court, included hitting, kicking, punching, inserting an object into Nordquist\u2019s anus, starvation, forced consumption of feces, urine and tobacco juice, pouring of bleach on him and duct taping him. The indictment also alleges the forced participation of young children in the assault and torture.",
      "The brutality and depravity of the crime \u2014 allegedly inflicted on the Black transgender man from Jan. 1 to Feb. 2 \u2014 has drawn national attention, sparked local demonstrations by LGBTQ rights advocates and raised the question from activists and his family: How could such a terrible thing happen without anyone notifying authorities?",
      "The indictment came a day after Nordquist was laid to rest in his native Minnesota. The 24-year-old set out from Oakdale, Minnesota, to Ontario County, New York, in September to connect\u00a0with a woman he\u2019d met online. That woman, Precious Arzuaga, is one of seven people charged in the indictment with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, two counts of kidnapping, conspiracy and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.",
      "She and three others, Kyle Sage, Patrick Goodwin and Jennifer Quijano, were charged with aggravated sexual abuse. In addition, Arzuaga was charged with coercion for allegedly forcing children, 7 and 12, to take part in attacks on Nordquist. The seven are also charged with concealing Nordquist\u2019s corpse, which they allegedly wrapped in plastic bags and dumped in a farmer\u2019s field.",
      "The gruesome details will likely grow as investigators piece together what happened in Room 22 of Patty\u2019s Lodge in the town of Hopewell, New York, authorities said.",
      "The indictment is \u201cjust a portion\u201d of Nordquist's ordeal, Ontario County Assistant District Attorney Kelly Wolford said at a news conference, where she grew visibly upset as she discussed the charges. \u201cIt\u2019s just what we know now,\u201d Wolford said.",

      "The seven people charged \u2014 Arzuaga, 38; her son, Thomas Eaves, 21; Quijano, 30; Sage, 33; Goodwin, 30; Emily Motyka, 19; and Kimberly Sochia, 29 \u2014 all knew one another, some romantically,  Wolford said. Records show that Goodwin, a registered sex offender, was staying in a nearby room at Patty\u2019s at the time. Goodwin and Sage were both on parole from previous sexually related crimes. All seven ended up in Room 22 at Patty\u2019s Lodge, where Nordquist was allegedly held captive, tortured and killed.",
      "\"They forced him to obey their commands, treating him like a dog,\" Wolford said.",
      "The Office of the Ontario County Conflict Defender, which is representing the seven suspects, declined to comment.",
      "Over the last several weeks, LGBTQ advocates from around the country have urged authorities to not rule out the possibility that Nordquist's killing was a hate crime.",
      "Wolford said prosecutors elected to charge the seven people with first-degree murder \u2014 and not hate crimes against a Black transgender man \u2014 because that is the heaviest penalty available to them under New York law.\u00a0If found guilty, the seven defendants could spend life in prison without parole.",
      "\u201cA hate crime would make this charge about Sam\u2019s gender or about Sam\u2019s race, and it\u2019s so much bigger,\u201d Wolford said. \u201cTo limit us to a hate crime would be an injustice to Sam. Sam deserves to have his story told in its entirety.\u201d",
      "Wolford called the alleged coercion of the two young children to participate in Nordquist's torture \"one of the more troubling parts\" of the investigation. The children's involvement was not previously known.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking. We have a 7-year-old and a 12-year-old who are also victims,\u201d she said. \u201cThey may have been forced to participate, but their lives are forever changed by what they saw and endured in there.\u201d",
      "When asked if the children belong to Arzuaga and if they were now in state custody, Welford declined to comment.",
      "Patty's Lodge is not being investigated for any wrongdoing, Wolford said. She added that there have not been any witnesses who reported Nordquist's captivity or torture to authorities while he was alive.",
      "\"This is a housing location,\" she said. \"It looks like a motel, but these people do live there full time, so what happens in their home is not something that, necessarily, Patty\u2019s Lodge is responsible for.\"",
      "Nordquist\u2019s mother and sister suggested in previous interviews with NBC News that Nordquist\u2019s death was preventable if local authorities had \u201cdone their jobs.\u201d",
      "The family said they requested two wellness checks on Nordquist with authorities. They also said that Nordquist expressed that he was in danger to a local social services agency.",
      "\u201cSam may be alive today if they would have done their jobs,\u201d Linda Nordquist, his mother, said through tears.",
      "After asking New York authorities for help, Nordquist\u2019s mother went to her local police department on Feb. 10 and filed a missing persons report, which was forwarded to Canandaigua police. Two days later, the New York State Police put out a public notice about Nordquist\u2019s disappearance, and on Feb. 13 his remains were found.",
      "Responding to the family\u2019s criticisms, New York State Police said in a statement last month that they \u201ctook appropriate investigative steps.\u201d The Ontario County Department of Social Services has not returned multiple requests for comment in recent weeks.",
      "When asked Wednesday if the social services department was aware that Nordquist was being controlled by the suspects, as his family suggested, Wolford declined to comment."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 At least 15 people were injured in South Korea on Thursday after fighter jets accidentally dropped eight bombs on a civilian area during a live-fire joint exercise with U.S. forces, the South Korean Air Force and fire officials said.",
      "The South Korean military said the training in Pocheon, a northeastern city of about 140,000 people near the heavily fortified border with North Korea, was in preparation for Freedom Shield, an annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise that is set to kick off on Monday.",
      "Just after 10 a.m. local time (8 p.m. Wednesday ET), eight 500-pound MK-82 bombs were \u201cabnormally released\u201d by two air force KF-16s, landing outside the designated firing range, the South Korean Air Force said.",
      "The air force said four of the bombs misfired because one of the fighter jet pilots entered incorrect coordinates during the flight preparation process, and that further investigation was needed to determine\u00a0why the second jet incorrectly dropped the four other bombs.",
      "\u201cThere are procedures to verify coordinates both on the ground and in the air. However, it appears that a mistake was made in this process,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.",
      "The JCS said live-fire drills were being suspended but that the Freedom Shield exercise would go ahead as planned.",
      "Two of the 15 people were civilians with serious but not life-threatening injuries, fire authorities told reporters. Those with minor injuries included two soldiers who were at a military chapel and two foreign nationals who were in the area.",
      "Eight buildings also sustained damage, officials said, including the chapel, five houses, one warehouse and one greenhouse.",
      "Photographs from the scene showed debris at the church and residences with shattered windows. Residents were being evacuated as authorities searched for any unexploded bombs.",
      "The fighter jet was participating in a combined live-fire exercise involving both the South Korean Air Force and Army, the air force said.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely regret the civilian damage caused by this accidental release and wish for the swift recovery of the injured,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Air Force will actively implement all necessary measures, including compensation for damages.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe are coordinating closely with the ROK Ministry of Defense and are committed to a thorough and transparent investigation,\u201d he said.",
      "South Korea, a U.S. treaty ally, hosts about 28,000 American service members. The Freedom Shield exercise, which runs from March 10 to 20, is designed to strengthen the alliance\u2019s combined defense posture in the face of growing threats from nuclear-armed North Korea.",
      "Since last year\u2019s exercise, North Korea has deepened its partnership with Russia, including by sending weapons and troops to support its war in Ukraine.",
      "After the accidental bombing on Thursday, the governing People Power Party urged a swift and transparent investigation, immediate support and compensation plans for affected residents and enhanced safety measures for training grounds near civilian areas.",
      "\u201cGiven that military training takes place near civilian areas, ensuring the highest level of safety management must be a priority,\u201d chief spokesperson Kim Dae-sik said in a statement, adding that the accident \u201craises serious concerns about basic safety checks and management protocols.\u201d",

      "As Washington turns off the tap on its $65 billion of military aid, Ukraine will also now have to do without American intelligence that has helped it to anticipate Russian attacks and troop movements, and avoid nightly barrages from Russian drones on its cities and infrastructure.",
      "Viewed from the homes and apartments of Kyiv, it seems like \u201ca very petty decision by our alleged ally,\u201d said Myroslava Yeremkiv, 33, who manages donations at a nongovernmental organization in the capital. \u201cThe United States has the power at least to protect and save the lives of civilians from Russia\u2019s brutal and terrorizing attacks \u2026 and you just choose not to.\u201d",
      "The White House cut off this intel feed following the disastrous Oval Office meeting last week between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. Though Trump\u2019s team hinted that the pause is a negotiating tactic to ensure Zelenskyy is \u201cready for peace,\u201d it has nonetheless shocked military and intelligence experts worldwide.",
      "That feeling is no less deeply felt in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThis looks like a thug tactic \u2014 blackmailing and trying to break Ukrainian society into submission before negotiations,\u201d Yeremkiv said, calling it a \u201cvery weak and pathetic decision.\u201d",
      "In some of the first practical consequences of that rupture, U.S. shipments of weapons and equipment already en-route to Ukraine were halted Monday night, a U.S. defense official told NBC News. So immediate was that order, that planes carrying vital aid for the Ukrainian war effort turned around in the sky, they added.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope that in the near future we can restore sharing of this information,\u201d said Oleksandr Musiienko, head of the Kyiv-based Center for Military and Legal Studies. \u201cWe will lose some types of information about flying warplanes from Russian airfields, about launching their terrorist attacks,\u201d added Musiienko, who also serves in the country\u2019s Territorial Defense Forces. \u201cThis means that we do not have enough security and defense for our civilians.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is not the only country providing military aid and intelligence. But it is by far Ukraine\u2019s largest single contributor of both. It will \u201cbe extremely difficult to fully compensate for this loss with our own capabilities or those of Europe,\u201d according to Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukraine government-backed think tank.",
      "Despite Moscow having the upper hand, Ukraine has slowed or even halted Russia\u2019s grinding winter advances. Kyiv has managed to shoot down most of the hundreds of Russian drones fired almost nightly at civilian targets in cities. That\u2019s partly down to $64 billion in American military assistance and $66 billion provided by all other countries combined, fueling Ukraine\u2019s fighting spirit that confounded predictions of swift Russian victory.",
      "At the European Union summit Thursday, Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans, who unlike Trump have committed to Kyiv\u2019s unconditional defense, which they see as a bulwark against wider Russian aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we are not alone,\u201d he told his fellow leaders.",
      "Some of this money covers intelligence, with U.S. know-how helping the Ukrainians to wield American-supplied materiel such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, and the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.",
      "Away from the battlefield, the decision to pull the plug \u2014 and\u00a0 pull it so publicly \u2014 will send shock waves\u00a0 through America\u2019s intelligence partners around the world, former officials said.",
      "\u201cThe signal it sends is atrocious,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is not a dependable ally.\u201d",
      "This message will also be heard loud and clear in Moscow.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a solution can be costly for Ukraine, particularly if Russia decides to exploit this weakness,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at the Le Beck consultancy.",
      "\u201cThe spat is public. Russia knows about this, so they will try to take advantage.\u201d",
      "Artem Grudinin and Anastasiia Parafeniuk reported from Kyiv, Ukraine. Alexander Smith reported from London."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/doge-plans-cut-va-contracts-may-harm-veterans-care-employees-say-rcna191448",
    "published": "Thu, 06 Mar 2025 12:08:05 GMT",
    "summary": "Despite a backlash, Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE is planning to terminate 585 VA contracts, some of which appear to be central to patient safety.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency abandoned some of its plans to slash contract spending for veterans\u2019 health care services this week after a revolt by front-line Veterans Health Administration employees who contended many of the cuts would imperil safety at the agency\u2019s almost 1,400 hospitals and clinics.",
      "What had been a list of 875 VA contracts scheduled for termination a little over a week ago has now become 585 canceled contracts, the VA said Monday. The about-face is a rare public retreat by the so-called efficiency operation known as DOGE, which has come under fire for moving to ax crucial government services and overstating the value of some of its savings to taxpayers.",
      "In its announcement reducing the number of contracts to be canceled, the VA said that the terminations \u201cwill not negatively affect Veteran care, benefits or services\u201d and that they \u201cwere identified through a deliberative, multi-level review.\u201d The agency acknowledged that some of the canceled contracts had already been fully paid for.",
      "The list of contracts still on the chopping block has not been made public, and the VA declined to provide it. But VA employees have identified 200 of the remaining scheduled cancellations to NBC News, and some of them appear to be central to patient safety, those employees say.",
      "For example, the revised list of killed contracts includes those covering sterility certification for VA hospital pharmacy operations, facility air quality and safety testing to prevent transmission of infections, and sterile processing services to decontaminate equipment and medical instruments.\u00a0Also on the list: contracts providing required certification and accreditation for stroke centers and follow-up care for cancer patients.",
      "Another contract that remains scheduled for cancellation supports the\u00a0National Center for PTSD, a VA entity that is\u00a0the world\u2019s leading research and educational center on post-traumatic stress disorder. Also terminated is a contract that would continue a long-established technology upgrade of the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s electronic health records system.",
      "The VA said it could not comment on the contracts unless NBC News identified\u00a0them by contract\u00a0name and contract number. NBC News declined to do so out of concern that it could reveal the identity of its sources.",
      "The spokesman for DOGE did not respond to an email seeking comment.",
      "On Wednesday, the VA announced that it was laying off 80,000 workers in an agencywide reorganization scheduled for August. The aim is to reduce its workforce to its 2019 level of 400,000, the memo to employees said. The agency\u00a0dismissed\u00a02,400 probationary employees in February.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the\u00a0Veterans Affairs Committee, said he learned about the new contract cancellations from NBC News. He characterized them as a \u201creckless\u201d move by Veterans Affairs Secretary Doug Collins.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, cancelling these contracts will cause harm to veterans and VA care and benefits,\u201d Blumenthal said in a statement. \u201cAnd it is completely unacceptable there has been no transparency, accountability, or consultation surrounding these contracts. By intentionally concealing from Congress the full list of contracts cancelled, Collins makes clear his intentions to use these terminated services as numbers for his press release, with zero regard for veterans.\u201d",
      "'Most stringent standards'",
      "It has been a harrowing few weeks for VA employees charged with operating the nation\u2019s largest health care system, according to five agency officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they are afraid of retaliation. In recent days, several VA employees have been suspended indefinitely after they were accused of sharing nonpublic information about the DOGE contract terminations, according to a VA official and a congressional staffer in touch with the employees.",
      "The VA spokesman declined to comment on whether employees have been suspended.",
      "The recent tumult inside the VA began roughly 10 days ago when employees received a list of 875 contracts DOGE apparently determined were wasteful. To the astonishment of some Veterans Health Administration employees, many of the contracts were crucial to the safe operation of VA facilities. Including them on the list suggested that DOGE had done little analysis of the contracts\u2019 functions, four current employees told NBC News.",
      "For example, one type of canceled contract on the initial list paid for the safety monitoring of hospital\u00a0radiation equipment used for X-rays and MRIs and to treat and screen veterans for cancer.",
      "The monitoring, required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is conducted at least annually by experts known as\u00a0medical physicists\u00a0to ensure that the equipment is safe for patients and that it delivers the appropriate amounts of radiation. The machinery must also be checked to ensure employees using it are not exposed to dangerous radiation levels.",
      "Hospitals are subject to regular audits and inspections, and if radiation equipment is found to be in violation, it must be rectified within a certain period. Without contractors available to resolve the problem quickly, the hospital departments using the equipment would have to shut down, the VA officials said. The hospitals would most likely have to close, as well, a VA official said, because \u201cyou cannot have a hospital that does not have a radiology department.\u201d",
      "Last week, after they received the list of 875 terminated contracts, employees in the nationwide Veterans Health Administration regional care systems, many of them veterans themselves,\u00a0objected and argued for reinstatement of many of the contracts, the VA officials told NBC News. The Veterans Health Administration serves roughly 9 million enrolled veterans in its medical centers and outpatient clinics every year.",
      "A VA official said that when he saw the initial list, he concluded:\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re trying to push veterans into community care,\u201d referring to services provided outside VA hospitals and clinics. \u201cAnd to do that, they\u2019re doing everything they can to make the VA mission fail.\u201d",
      "Amid the backlash last week, the VA paused its planned cuts. Then, on Monday, it announced the contract termination list had fallen by one-third, to 585 contracts. Medical physicists charged with monitoring facility radiation equipment were no longer on the canceled list.",
      "Among the contracts still scheduled to be terminated at the VA is one covering the certification of areas and equipment in VA pharmacies used to combine multiple drugs, known as compounded medicines. Such certifications are at the heart of patient safety, because compounded medicines, which patients with cancer and other maladies use, must be made in special settings.",
      "According to\u00a0The Joint Commission, the country\u2019s oldest and largest standards-setting and accrediting body in health care, certifying compounding areas ensures that pharmacies \u201cmeet the most stringent standards in safety and reliability.\u201d",
      "The terminated list also includes contracts for a practice crucial to preventing infection in hospitals: the sterilization of medical devices and instruments needed during surgery.",
      "Other contracts set for termination handle air quality testing, the documents show. Certain states, such as California and Massachusetts, have standards for air quality that must be met in health care facilities to reduce the transmission of hospital infections. The Joint Commission has its own airflow standards, and to meet them, facility equipment must be tested to ensure high ventilation rates.",
      "Although the revised list of contracts reinstated medical physicists, who are the radiology experts who monitor equipment for excessive or inappropriate levels of radiation, the documents reviewed by NBC News show the termination of multiple contracts for radiation safety officers, a similar role. Those contractors ensure that a facility\u2019s radiation safety program complies with regulations.",
      "As for the health records upgrade and the contracts for the National Center for PTSD, which provides information about the disorder for veterans and their families, as well as helps find providers, both appear to be viewed as \"non-mission critical.\""

      "Some U.S. allies are considering scaling back the intelligence they share with Washington in response to the Trump administration\u2019s conciliatory approach to Russia,\u00a0four sources with\u00a0direct\u00a0knowledge of\u00a0the discussions told NBC News.",
      "The allies are weighing the move because of concerns about safeguarding foreign assets whose identities could inadvertently be revealed, said the sources, who included a foreign official.",
      "Every intelligence agency treats its commitments to foreign agents as sacrosanct, pledging to keep agents safe and shield their identities. Anything that jeopardized that obligation would violate that trust, former officials said, and that could lead some spy services to hold back on some information sharing with Washington.",
      "The allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and members of the so-called Five Eyes spy alliance of English-speaking democracies, are examining how to possibly revise current protocols for sharing intelligence to take the Trump administration\u2019s warming relations with Russia into account, the sources said",
      "\u201cThose discussions are already happening,\u201d said a source with direct knowledge of the discussions.",
      "No decision or action has been taken, however, the sources said.",
      "The review is part of a wider examination of the spectrum of relations with Washington among many U.S. allies, including diplomacy, trade and military cooperation, as well as intelligence matters, the sources said.",
      "Historic implications",
      "Though the extent of a U.S. policy change toward Russia remains unclear, allies are weighing the possible implications of what could be a historic shift, a Western official said.",
      "Asked about allies\u2019 possibly limiting what they share with the United States, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council said President\u00a0Donald\u00a0Trump is \u201cclear-eyed\u201d about America\u2019s adversaries.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. has unrivaled intelligence capabilities which is exactly why intelligence sharing initiatives such as the Five Eyes exist,\u201d spokesman Brian Hughes said in an email.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is\u00a0clear-eyed on all threats our adversaries pose to our national security and he will work with any ally or partner who understands the dangerous world inherited after the disastrous Biden years,\" he added. \"On Biden\u2019s watch, we had the war in Ukraine, the surrender in Afghanistan, and the slaughter of the innocents\u00a0on October 7th.\u201d",
      "Administration officials and some Republican lawmakers have defended Trump\u2019s handling of Russia as a tactic designed to bring Moscow to the negotiating table and clinch a peace deal that would end a destabilizing war in Europe. But distrust of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran KGB officer, remains high among U.S. allies.",
      "Publicly, longtime U.S. allies downplayed the issue. The United Kingdom, the most important U.S. intelligence partner, said it had no plans to reduce intelligence cooperation with the United States.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is the UK\u2019s closest ally and we will continue to cooperate closely on defence, intelligence and security matters,\u201d a British government spokesperson said in an email. \u201cAny suggestion otherwise is totally untrue.\u201d",
      "The Canada Security Intelligence Service said in a statement that it has strong relationships with numerous U.S. agencies that are \u201clong-standing and resilient.\u201d",
      "It added, \u201cCanada deeply values its partnership with the United States, and we believe that it is in the strategic interest of both countries to continue our strong national security cooperation.\u201d",
      "An Israeli official also praised its alliance with the U.S., saying \"Cooperation between Israel and the United States on every level, including the sharing of crucial intelligence data, is as strong and solid as ever.\"",
      "Officials from New Zealand, Australia and Saudi Arabia did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Some officials in allied countries, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence matters, played down the idea that  Trump\u2019s policies on Russia would disrupt information sharing that dates back decades. They noted that intelligence can be shared in ways that protect sources and methods.",
      "But some former U.S. intelligence officers say they are concerned that the Trump administration may opt to scale back intelligence collection aimed at Russia, as the U.S. may no longer see Russia as a top threat.",
      "The administration, for example, has indicated it may place a higher priority on efforts to counter drug cartels from Mexico and other countries in the region. Already, the Defense Department has deployed more resources to the southern border, including a team of analysts. And the CIA has launched drone surveillance flights over Mexico as part of that effort.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision this week to pause intelligence assistance to Ukraine, along with military aid, has reinforced concerns among  allies. The intelligence cooperation with Kyiv \u2014 which has developed since Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014 \u2014 has benefited both Washington and Kyiv, former officials say, with Ukraine providing valuable insights about Russia.",
      "In weighing whether to dial back some intelligence sharing, the Five Eyes allies \u2014 the U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand \u2014 and other U.S. partners would have to take into account risks to their own national security if cooperation with Washington were reduced.",
      "Cybersecurity concerns",
      "But recent moves by the Trump administration regarding cybersecurity have also fueled concerns about the administration\u2019s engagement with Moscow.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last month\u00a0ordered U.S. Cyber Command to halt offensive cyber operations and information operations against Russia, NBC News has reported. It is unclear how long the order will last.",
      "And in a\u00a0speech at a U.N. working group on cybersecurity\u00a0last month, a senior State Department official, Liesyl Franz, made no mention of Russia as a top cyber threat and cited only China and Iran.",
      "For years, including during Trump\u2019s first term, Republican and Democratic administrations have described Russia as one of the most sophisticated and dangerous threats to American cybersecurity.",
      "With Trump and his deputies echoing some of Russia\u2019s talking points about the Ukraine war and indicating they hope to expand U.S. relations with Moscow, former intelligence officials say the administration may even share some sensitive information with Moscow.",
      "Several former U.S. intelligence officers said they and their colleagues still in government are deeply concerned about the possible implications of the administration\u2019s shift toward Russia, in which Moscow may no longer be treated as an adversary.",
      "\u201cPeople are very worried,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "Formidable alliance",
      "The Five Eyes alliance is arguably the most formidable espionage alliance in the world.\u00a0The intelligence cooperation among its members is deeply embedded, dating to the 1940s, and officials have credited it with helping counter the Soviets during the Cold War and foiling terrorist plots in recent decades.",
      "The sharing of satellite imagery and eavesdropping intelligence among alliance members is extensive, highly integrated and \u201cnearly automatic,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "Unwinding the technical side of the alliance\u2019s cooperation would be complicated and difficult, former officials said. A likelier scenario could have allied governments withholding some intelligence from human sources or analyses that could cause friction with the White House, several former intelligence officials said.",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., a member of the House Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said he was deeply concerned by the Trump administration\u2019s \u201crapid pivot towards the Kremlin\u201d and media reports that U.S. Cyber Command was pulling back on cyber operations against Russia.",
      "\u201cRussia is an adversary and, as always, looking for opportunities to sow discord and make trouble for Americans and for the government, so any stand-down or pullback of our operations could be catastrophic,\u201d Crow said in an interview.",
      "The administration\u2019s actions on cybersecurity have fueled speculation that Washington and Moscow may have come to an informal understanding to pull back from aggressive digital operations to reduce tensions and open the way for more diplomacy.",
      "It is possible that the Trump administration and Russia have agreed to \u201ca cyber d\u00e9tente,\u201d said Emily Harding, a former intelligence official. But Harding and other former intelligence officials warned that in past, attempts by the United States to forge limited cooperation with Russia, the Kremlin has proved to be an unreliable partner.",
      "\u201cThat sounds good in theory,\u201d said Harding, director of the Intelligence, National Security, and Technology Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington. \u201cI think the next question is whether you think Russia would actually stick to it.\u201d",
      "A hub for cybercriminals",
      "A major hitch to any cyber d\u00e9tente with Moscow is Russia\u2019s status as a hub of cybercriminals who target Americans. Russia does not extradite its citizens, and it has largely refused to work with U.S. law enforcement agencies when they identify hackers attacking American businesses, hospitals and government networks.",
      "Of particular concern is ransomware, in which hackers, often Russian-speaking criminal gangs, deploy malicious software to lock up computer networks and demand payment.",
      "Known attacks on the U.S. public sector frequently tied to Russia have steadily increased each year through 2024,\u00a0according to a survey\u00a0conducted by the cybersecurity company Emsisoft.",
      "The cybersecurity insurer Coalition\u00a0found in a report\u00a0published in October that ransomware attacks around the globe cost companies  $353,000 on average last year. In some instances, ransomware gangs have alluded to ties to Russian intelligence.",
      "Philip Reiner, CEO of the Institute for Security and Technology, a San Francisco think tank that focuses on cybersecurity policy, told NBC News that any new agreement with Russia needs to persuade the Kremlin to rein in its cybercriminals\u00a0who target Americans, as they rarely face legal repercussions in Russia.",
      "\u201cAny engagement the Trump administration has to normalize relations around cyber has got to take into account the economic terrorism that Russia engages in via ransomware gangs,\u201d Reiner said. \u201cThat has to be a factor in any overall negotiation.\u201d",
      "Previous U.S. presidents from both parties have tried to \u201creset\u201d relations with Russia and explored sharing intelligence about common threats with Moscow. After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, President George W. Bush asked U.S. spy agencies to pursue possible collaboration\u00a0with Russia on terrorism threats. But the effort \u201cwent nowhere fast,\u201d a former intelligence official said.",
      "The Russians were not interested in sharing sensitive information about terrorist groups, according to former officials.",
      "In an op-ed in 2020 in The Washington Post, former CIA officer John Sipher and other former colleagues recounted how attempts to increase cooperation with Moscow\u2019s spy services repeatedly failed.",
      "\u201cInside the CIA, we often joked that, to Putin, win-win means I beat you twice,\u201d they wrote. \u201cGood intentions from the U.S. side have proved time and again to have been futile in improving relations.\u201d"

      "\"Wow!\" Willie said in response to his wife's comment. \"Alright, I'm glad she got the last word on that!\"",
      "Willie said that he didn't realize he was being recorded in the now-viral video, and was shocked when he got home and his wife had already seen the interaction.",
      "\"I said, 'How did you see that?'\" he said. \"'It's on Instagram.' I said, 'Of course, it is.'\""

When the project manager brings his concerns to the architect in charge\u2019s attention, he gets fired. The architect warns him to forget about the job and that something catastrophic is coming.",

While Bradford\u2019s team investigates his murder, Sinatra has the public believe that the president died of natural causes.",

After changing his appearance to look like the librarian, he meets a woman who is unfulfilled with her life and offers her the wife\u2019s ID card as her own.",
      "When they are being scanned to go into Paradise, it shows that the two have taken the identities of Eli and Margaret Davis.",
      "Why and how did he kill President Bradford?",
      "While in the library, Collins gets knocked out by the librarian after he discovers the president\u2019s secret book with information about how to leave Paradise.",
      "After tying Collins up, the man confesses and admits that after entering Paradise he got comfortable and didn\u2019t go through with his initial plan to kill the president. But when President Bradford came into the library asking if he could make a mixed CD, the man says that his feelings of anger towards the president \u201ccame flooding back.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew I had to finish what I started,\u201d the man tells Collins, expressing that he wanted revenge for the people who died building Paradise and for them not being invited into the bunker.",
      "The man was able to kill the president by sneaking into his room at night and hitting him over the head with a large rotary drill bit that was seen on display at the library.",
      "While still conscious, President Bradford attempted to leave a sign for Collins by drawing an X with his blood on his cigarettes. As viewers saw earlier, one of the cigarettes contained a code that led to a library book with secret information about how to get out of Paradise.",
      "The man saw that the president was still alive and hit him over the head again, killing him.",

      "President Donald Trump threatened Wednesday to have members of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza killed if hostages are not immediately released.",
      "\"'Shalom Hamas' means Hello and Goodbye \u2014 You can choose. Release all of the Hostages now, not later, and immediately return all of the dead bodies of the people you murdered, or it is OVER for you,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "\u201cI have just met with your former Hostages whose lives you have destroyed. This is your last warning! For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza, while you still have a chance,\u201d he added. \u201cAlso, to the People of Gaza: A beautiful Future awaits, but not if you hold Hostages. If you do, you are DEAD! Make a SMART decision. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY LATER!\u201d",
      "The White House said in a statement that Trump met Wednesday with eight hostages released from Gaza: Iair\u00a0Horn, Omer\u00a0Shem Tov, Eli\u00a0Sharabi, Keith Siegel, Aviva Siegel, Naama\u00a0Levy, Doron\u00a0Steinbrecher and Noa Argamani.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The administration is engaging in direct talks with Hamas over the release of U.S. hostages still held in the Gaza Strip, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed Wednesday.",
      "Trump believes the dialogue is part of\u00a0a \"good-faith effort to do what\u2019s right for the American people,\" Leavitt said at a White House news briefing.",
      "\"There are American lives at stake,\" she added, saying Israel had been consulted.",
      "Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem responded to Trump's comments, telling Turkish state-run news agency Anadolu Agency \"These threats complicate matters regarding the ceasefire agreement and encourage the occupation not to implement its terms.\"",
      "\"There is an agreement that was signed and Washington was a mediator in it, which includes the release of all prisoners in 3 stages,\" Qassem added, \"and Hamas has implemented what it was required to do in the first stage, while Israel is evading the second stage.\"",
      "The six-week ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ended Saturday with no extension of peace negotiations in sight. It is the first time the United States has held direct talks with the group, which it has designated a terrorist organization.",
      "Axios first reported the talks between the United States and Hamas.",
      "Asked whether the scope of the talks included Trump's proposal to take over Gaza, Leavitt said she would not go into details and referred questions to the State Department.",
      "Initially, the idea for a second phase of a ceasefire included Hamas\u2019 releasing more hostages in return for Israel's withdrawing from the Palestinian territory, with the aim of ending the war.",
      "But with no talks continuing, Israel reinstated a halt in the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza after the initial phase of the ceasefire ended. Hamas then accused Israel of violating their agreement by \u201cevading the commitment to end the war and withdraw completely from Gaza.\u201d",
      "Israel recently approved a plan from the\u00a0U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff,\u00a0that would have continued the first stage of the ceasefire through Ramadan and Passover instead of proceeding to the second phase of peace talks.",
      "Witkoff's plan called for the release of half of the\u00a0remaining hostages, including the bodies of those who have died, on the first day and the remaining hostages once a permanent ceasefire deal is reached, according to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office.",
      "But Hamas rejected the proposal, saying it didn't honor the original, multiphased ceasefire agreement.",
      "\"Unfortunately, these positions by the United States strengthened the position of the Zionist right within the government and pushed for taking punitive steps, including closing the crossings in this manner and using the starvation policy against the people of the Gaza Strip,\" the group\u2019s spokesman, Hazem Qassem, said in a statement Sunday.",
      "White House National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said in a statement Sunday that Israel has \"negotiated in good faith since the beginning of this administration to ensure the release of hostages held captive by Hamas terrorists.\"",
      "Hughes added that the United States will support Israel's decision on next steps \"given Hamas has indicated it\u2019s no longer interested in a negotiated ceasefire.\"",
      "On Monday, Netanyahu warned Hamas in remarks before the Knesset, Israel's legislature, that if the group didn't release more hostages, \"there will be consequences beyond your imagination. We are preparing for the next stages of the campaign \u2014 not everything is visible, and that\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "The Biden administration announced initial ceasefire in January just days before Trump's inauguration. It required a pause of Israel's military operations in Gaza and the release of both living and dead hostages held there in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel."

      "Ukraine has other partners in Europe, including the United Kingdom, that can provide battlefield and other intelligence to Kyiv, though there will be a gap that can\u2019t be entirely filled, former intelligence officers with knowledge of the matter said. But they noted that the longer the pause, the more Ukraine will face complications.",
      "U.S. spy agencies provide sophisticated surveillance imagery and eavesdropping intelligence that helps Ukraine anticipate Russian aerial and ground attacks, enables Kyiv to track and target Russian forces, and assists Ukraine\u2019s espionage efforts, according to former intelligence officials.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes, D-Conn., the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, condemned the suspension of intelligence help for Ukraine, saying it has saved the lives of Ukrainian troops and civilians.",
      "\u201cThe pause on providing materiel to Ukraine against Putin\u2019s aggression is unconscionable on its own, but the idea that we will now withhold life-saving intelligence from Ukrainians who are fighting and dying is unforgivable,\u201d Himes said in a statement. \u201cAny pause in intelligence sharing must end immediately.\u201d",
      "Apart from the impact on Ukraine\u2019s battlefield, the decision to suspend intelligence cooperation \u2014 and to announce it publicly \u2014 will send shock waves among America\u2019s intelligence partners around the world, former intelligence officers said.",
      "\u201cThe signal it sends is atrocious,\u201d said Marc\u00a0Polymeropoulos,\u00a0a former senior CIA officer. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is not a dependable ally.\u201d",
      "In the past, intelligence cooperation has tended to continue uninterruptedly between the U.S. and its partners, even at times of serious friction among political leaders. But the Trump administration appears to have broken with that tradition, using intelligence as a political tool, according to Polymeropoulos and other former intelligence officers.",
      "John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA\u2019s\u00a0clandestine service,\u00a0called the move \u201cfoolhardy\u201d and damaging to America\u2019s reputation among other spy agencies.",
      "\u201cThe decision to stop intelligence assistance is foolhardy and ill-considered. Good intelligence cooperation should be kept secret and outside the vagaries of politics,\u201d Sipher said. \u201cIt is the last place to make a public stand, especially when there are so many other ways to pressure a partner.\u201d",
      "Both CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Trump\u2019s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Wednesday the administration had paused military and intelligence assistance to Ukraine after a tense public exchange last week in the Oval Office between Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "The White House had previously announced a suspension in military aid but did not initially specify a pause in intelligence sharing with Kyiv.\u00a0The administration said it had opted to suspend the assistance until Ukraine\u2019s government showed it was ready to pursue peace negotiations.",
      "Ratcliffe said on Fox Business that he expected the pause to be lifted soon based on Zelenskyy\u2019s statement Tuesday expressing a readiness to enter into peace negotiations with Russia and to back a proposed agreement that would grant the United States a share in the rights to the country\u2019s mineral wealth. The CIA director suggested the suspension of military and intelligence aid had the intended effect on Kyiv\u2019s calculations.",
      "Ratcliffe said: \u201cPresident Zelenskyy put out a statement saying, \u2018I\u2019m ready for peace and I want Donald Trump\u2019s leadership to bring about that peace.\u2019\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cSo I think on the military front and intelligence front, the pause that allowed that to happen will go away and I think we\u2019ll work shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine as we have to push back on the aggression that\u2019s there, but to put the world in a better place for these peace negotiations.\u201d",
      "Western governments once regarded Ukraine\u2019s intelligence services as unreliable and riddled with Russian-backed agents. But in 2014, after mass street protests forced the pro-Kremlin then-president of Ukraine,\u00a0Viktor Yanukovych, to flee to Russia, the Ukrainian government and the CIA worked to build new intelligence services.",
      "Ukraine shared highly valuable information on Russia with the Americans, and U.S. personnel\u00a0trained a new generation\u00a0of Ukrainian spies and commandos. That cooperation intensified after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion three years ago, former intelligence officers said.",
      "The United Kingdom\u2019s intelligence service, MI6, and military have also closely collaborated with Ukraine over the past decade, former officials say.",

      "In a speech at the Knesset, Israel's parliament, Netanyahu, without providing any evidence, suggested the findings would be \u201cpredetermined\u201d and told lawmakers it was \u201cimportant and crucial to investigate in depth the events of Oct. 7 and what led up to it,\u201d but  thought a court-led probe would be biased.",
      "\u201cWhat do you think? That we\u2019re children?\u201d he shouted into a microphone as some his fellow politicians jeered and shouted at him during Monday night's debate.",
      "Israel\u2019s High Court of Justice ruled in December that Netanyahu\u2019s government\u00a0should hold a Cabinet hearing on whether to form a state commission of inquiry\u00a0to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Hamas-led attacks, looking at why the country\u2019s military was unable to prevent the deadly assault.",

      "Lawmakers, including former war Cabinet minister Benny Gantz, have long called for a state commission to be set up.",
      "Banging on the podium in the Knesset, Netanyahu acknowledged that the \u201cpublic demands the truth\u201d about the Hamas attacks and he called for the formation of a commission that would \u201cinvestigate everything,\u201d including alleged leaks from Cabinet meetings and confidential parliamentary sessions.",
      "He went on to blast the media, accusing news outlets of  \u201cfull cooperation with the deep state\u201d and of creating \u201cscandals.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe cooperation between the bureaucracy in the deep state and the media didn\u2019t work in the United States, and it won\u2019t work here,\u201d he said, aping the rhetoric of President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly referred to the idea that clandestine networks operate within governments, acting to manipulate or control policy.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s rivals were quick to condemn his comments. Opposition leader Yair Lapid said the events of Oct. 7 would \u201calways belong\u201d to the Israeli prime minister, adding that \u201cthere was never a government here that had so many reasons to ask for forgiveness.\u201d",
      "Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said the debate reflected a \u201ctotal disconnect\u201d by a \u201cdisastrous government.\u201d",
      "After conducting its own investigation into the deadly attacks, Israel\u2019s military acknowledged last month that it had misjudged Hamas\u2019 intentions and underestimated the militant group\u2019s capabilities and was wholly unprepared for the surprise attack, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli officials.",
      "More than 48,000 people have been killed in Israel's assault on Gaza since then, according to health officials in the enclave.",

      "The seven weapons experts were booked to travel from Moscow to Tehran aboard two flights on April 24 and September 17 last year, according to documents detailing the two group bookings as well as the passenger manifest for the second flight.",
      "The booking records include the men\u2019s passport numbers, with six of the seven having the prefix \u201c20.\u201d That denotes a passport used for official state business, issued to government officials on foreign work trips and military personnel stationed abroad, according to an edict published by the Russian government and a document on the Russian foreign ministry\u2019s website.",
      "Reuters was unable to determine what the seven were doing in Iran.",
      "A senior Iranian defense ministry official said Russian missile experts had made multiple visits to Iranian missile production sites last year, including two underground facilities, with some of the visits taking place in September. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss security matters, didn\u2019t identify the sites.",
      "A Western defense official, who monitors Iran\u2019s defense cooperation with Russia and also requested anonymity, said an unspecified number of Russian missile experts visited an Iranian missile base, about 9 miles west of the port of Amirabad on Iran\u2019s Caspian Sea coast, in September.",
      "Reuters couldn\u2019t establish if the visitors referred to by the officials included the Russians on the two flights.",
      "The seven Russians identified by Reuters all have senior military backgrounds, with two ranked colonel and two lieutenant-colonel, according to a review of Russian databases containing information about citizens\u2019 jobs or places of work, including tax, phone and vehicle records.",
      "Two are experts in air-defense missile systems, three specialize in artillery and rocketry, while one has a background in advanced weapons development and another has worked at a missile-testing range, the records showed. Reuters was unable to establish whether all are still working in those roles as the employment data ranged from 2021 to 2024.",
      "Their flights to Tehran came at a precarious time for Iran, which found itself drawn into a tit-for-tat battle with arch-foe Israel that saw both sides mount military strikes on each other in April and October.",
      "Reuters contacted all the men by phone: five of them denied they had been to Iran, denied they worked for the military or both, while one declined to comment and one hung up.",
      "Iran\u2019s defense and foreign ministries declined to comment for this article, as did the public relations office of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an elite force that oversees Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program. The Russian defense ministry didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Cooperation between the two countries, whose leaders signed a 20-year military pact in Moscow in January, has already influenced Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, with large numbers of Iranian-designed Shahed drones deployed on the battlefield.",

      "The flight booking information for the seven travellers was shown to Reuters by Hooshyaran-e Vatan, a group of activist hackers opposed to the Iranian government. The hackers said the seven were travelling with VIP status.",
      "Reuters corroborated the information with the Russian passenger manifest for the September flight, which was provided by a source with access to Russian state databases. The news agency was unable to access a manifest for the earlier flight, so couldn\u2019t verify that the five Russian specialists booked on it actually made the trip.",
      "Denis Kalko, 48, and 46-year-old Vadim Malov were among the five Russian weapons experts whose seats were booked as a group on the April flight, the records showed.",
      "Kalko worked at the defense ministry\u2019s Academy for Military Anti-Aircraft Defense, tax records for 2021 show. Malov worked for a military unit that trains anti-aircraft missile forces, according to car ownership records for 2024.",
      "Andrei Gusev, 45, Alexander Antonov, 43, and Marat Khusainov, 54, were also booked on the April flight. Gusev is a lieutenant-colonel who works as deputy head of the faculty of General Purpose Rockets and Artillery Munitions at the defense ministry\u2019s Penza Artillery Engineering Institute, according to a 2021 news item on the institute\u2019s website.",
      "Antonov has worked at the Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Defense Ministry, according to car registration records from 2024, while bank data shows Khusainov, a colonel, has worked at the Kapustin Yar missile-testing range.",
      "One of the two passengers onboard the second flight to Tehran in September was Sergei Yurchenko, 46, who has also worked at the Rocket and Artillery Directorate, according to undated mobile phone records. His passport number had the prefix \u201c22;\u201d Reuters was unable to determine what that signified though, according to the government edict on passports, it isn\u2019t used for private citizens or diplomats.",
      "The other passenger on the September flight was 46-year-old Oleg Fedosov. Residence records give his address as the office of the Directorate of Advanced Inter-Service Research and Special Projects. That is a branch of the defense ministry tasked with developing weapons systems of the future.",
      "Fedosov had previously flown from Tehran to Moscow in October 2023, according to Russian border crossing records viewed by Reuters. On that occasion, as he did for the September 2024 flight, Fedosov used his passport reserved for official state business, the records showed."

    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Russia's Vladimir Putin has for years unsuccessfully tried to oust Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Now, those efforts are being entertained by senior officials in Ukraine\u2019s single most important backer, the United States.",
      "Either Zelenskyy \u201cneeds to come to his senses and come back to the table in gratitude or someone else needs to lead the country to do that,\u201d House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday. Two days after the Ukrainian president was publicly berated by President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, and asked to leave the White House without signing an important deal, Johnson said it was \u201cup to the Ukrainians to figure that out.\u201d",
      "National security adviser Mike Waltz said Washington needed \u201ca leader that can deal with us, eventually deal with the Russians, and end this war.\u201d He told CNN that \u201cif it becomes apparent that President Zelenskyy\u2019s either personal motivations or political motivations are divergent from ending the fighting in this country, then I think we have a real issue.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wasn\u2019t sure if the U.S. \u201ccan ever do business with Zelenskyy again.\u201d He said that Ukraine\u2019s leader \u201ceither needs to resign and send somebody over that we can do business with, or he needs to change.\u201d",
      "Critics say this plays into the hands of Russia, aiding Moscow\u2019s yearslong bid to oust Ukraine\u2019s pro-Western leader, while fanning Kyiv\u2019s domestic political divisions during wartime.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dimitry Peskov on Monday called the White House clash an \u201cunprecedented event\u201d that showed \u201cZelenskyy largely demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic skills.\u201d The exchange was part of Ukraine\u2019s \u201crefusal to acknowledge the real situation on the ground,\u201d he said. \u201cOnly a blind person could fail to see this, and only a deaf person would refuse to hear it.\u201d",
      "Still, the Ukrainian leader has remained defiant and popular among European leaders. There is also evidence that last week\u2019s clash in the Oval Office may have even boosted his domestic support.",
      "\u201cIf they replace me, given what is going on, given the support, simply replacing me will not be simple,\u201d Zelenskyy told British media. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just hold an election. You need to also not let me run. This will be a bit more difficult. Looks like you will have to negotiate with me.\u201d",
      "Trump and his advisers such as Elon Musk have criticized Ukraine\u2019s indefinite postponement of elections scheduled for 2024, delayed because the country is under martial law following its invasion by Russia. That led to Trump calling democratically elected Zelenskyy  \u201ca dictator without elections.\u201d",
      "More and more Ukrainians are in favor of this pause, with support\u00a0 up to 58% from 52% last week, Ukrainian pollster Gradus found in data published Sunday.",
      "Other polling suggests that, while certainly more politically fallible than he was during the early days of the war, Zelenskyy remains widely popular and could well win a democratic ballot. In fact, another Gradus survey suggested that the Oval Office bust-up has coincided with a boost in Zelenskyy\u2019s domestic approval rising to 49% as of Saturday.",
      "Meanwhile, trust in Zelenskyy appears to be increasing, up to 65% from 57% in January, a poll by\u00a0the Ukrainian research organization Rating Group found.",
      "Zelenskyy \u201cwas elected in 2019 with the large margin,\u201d said Yevhen Mahda, director of the Kyiv think tank Institute of World Policy, adding that there isn\u2019t a serious risk to his leadership inside the country. Although Zelenskyy has offered to resign if Ukraine gets NATO membership, these statements are \u201ca bit populistic\u201d because of how unlikely that is, Mahda said.",
      "One man possibly more popular than him is Valerii Zaluzhnyi, Ukraine\u2019s former top military commander \u2014 known as the Iron General \u2014 whom Zelenskyy fired in a February 2024 shakeup. Zaluzhniy, since posted to the United Kingdom as ambassador, was trusted by 76% of respondents in the Rating Group survey \u2014 higher than his boss, the president.",
      "But in informal conversations over the weekend, political, military and diplomatic figures in Kyiv, even those who did not personally support the Ukrainian leader, unanimously told NBC News that replacing Zelenskyy now would only benefit Russia. Rather than seeing a humiliation of their leader, they saw it as an example of Ukraine standing up to the U.S. and saying \u201cno.\u201d",
      "Still, many in Ukraine are under no illusions at the leverage Washington still holds over them.",
      "One soldier in Kramatorsk, Volodymyr Chystyi, whose nickname is clean guy, laid it out in stark terms: \u201cThe only international pressure that could possibly force Zelenslyi to resign is a pressure from America.\u201d",
      "Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party, said her leader has \u201cmade it clear he\u2019s not in politics for power. His aim is to ensure real, lasting peace to Ukraine and to achieve some security guarantees.\u201d",
      "\u201cHonestly, I do not understand calls for President Zelenskyy to resign in the middle of an existential genocidal war,\u201d she added. \u201cOur defense heavily depends on President Zelenskyy\u2019s leadership. Even the critics in Ukraine acknowledge that the discussion about replacing him is absurd and premature.\u201d",
      "Trump has wrongly claimed that Zelenskyy\u2019s approval rating is 4%, and Musk said the Ukrainian leader was avoiding a vote because he would \u201close in a landslide.\u201d",
      "There doesn\u2019t appear to be much evidence for either of these assertions. Trump appears to have gotten his statistic from an unscientific poll on the Telegram messaging service by one of Zelenskyy\u2019s political rivals.",
      "Alexander Smith reported from London, and Victor Sema and Daryna Meyer from Kyiv."

    "story": [
      "KYIV \u2014 Ukraine may have enough weapons to fight Russia unaffected for a few weeks at least, but President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to stop sharing intelligence will cost civilian lives almost immediately, dismayed Ukrainians said Thursday.",
      "Trump\u2019s decision to halt intelligence came as European leaders, including Ukrainian President Volodymy Zelenskyy, convened a\u00a0 summit in Brussels as they attempt to cope with an upended landscape in which the Trump administration appears to be treating them with hostility while seemingly warming to the Kremlin.",
      "Miles away from these high-powered meetings, ordinary Ukrainians may have to confront the real-world consequences of the White House\u2019s U-turn.",
      "As Washington turns off the tap on its $65 billion of military aid, Ukraine will also now have to do without American intelligence that has helped it to anticipate Russian attacks and troop movements, and avoid nightly barrages from Russian drones on its cities and infrastructure.",
      "Viewed from the homes and apartments of Kyiv, it seems like \u201ca very petty decision by our alleged ally,\u201d said Myroslava Yeremkiv, 33, who manages donations at a nongovernmental organization in the capital. \u201cThe United States has the power at least to protect and save the lives of civilians from Russia\u2019s brutal and terrorizing attacks \u2026 and you just choose not to.\u201d",
      "The White House cut off this intel feed following the disastrous Oval Office meeting last week between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Zelenskyy. Though Trump\u2019s team hinted that the pause is a negotiating tactic to ensure Zelenskyy is \u201cready for peace,\u201d it has nonetheless shocked military and intelligence experts worldwide.",
      "That feeling is no less deeply felt in Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThis looks like a thug tactic \u2014 blackmailing and trying to break Ukrainian society into submission before negotiations,\u201d Yeremkiv said, calling it a \u201cvery weak and pathetic decision.\u201d",
      "In some of the first practical consequences of that rupture, U.S. shipments of weapons and equipment already en-route to Ukraine were halted Monday night, a U.S. defense official told NBC News. So immediate was that order, that planes carrying vital aid for the Ukrainian war effort turned around in the sky, they added.",
      "\u201cI really, really hope that in the near future we can restore sharing of this information,\u201d said Oleksandr Musiienko, head of the Kyiv-based Center for Military and Legal Studies. \u201cWe will lose some types of information about flying warplanes from Russian airfields, about launching their terrorist attacks,\u201d added Musiienko, who also serves in the country\u2019s Territorial Defense Forces. \u201cThis means that we do not have enough security and defense for our civilians.\u201d",
      "The U.S. is not the only country providing military aid and intelligence. But it is by far Ukraine\u2019s largest single contributor of both. It will \u201cbe extremely difficult to fully compensate for this loss with our own capabilities or those of Europe,\u201d according to Mykola Bielieskov, a research fellow at the National Institute for Strategic Studies, a Ukraine government-backed think tank.",
      "Despite Moscow having the upper hand, Ukraine has slowed or even halted Russia\u2019s grinding winter advances. Kyiv has managed to shoot down most of the hundreds of Russian drones fired almost nightly at civilian targets in cities. That\u2019s partly down to $64 billion in American military assistance and $66 billion provided by all other countries combined, fueling Ukraine\u2019s fighting spirit that confounded predictions of swift Russian victory.",
      "At the European Union summit Thursday, Zelenskyy thanked the Europeans, who unlike Trump have committed to Kyiv\u2019s unconditional defense, which they see as a bulwark against wider Russian aggression. \u201cIt\u2019s great that we are not alone,\u201d he told his fellow leaders.",
      "Some of this money covers intelligence, with U.S. know-how helping the Ukrainians to wield American-supplied materiel such as the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, commonly known as HIMARS, and the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS.",
      "Away from the battlefield, the decision to pull the plug \u2014 and\u00a0 pull it so publicly \u2014 will send shock waves\u00a0 through America\u2019s intelligence partners around the world, former officials said.",
      "\u201cThe signal it sends is atrocious,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA officer. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to the rest of the world that the U.S. is not a dependable ally.\u201d",
      "This message will also be heard loud and clear in Moscow.",
      "\u201cEvery day that passes without a solution can be costly for Ukraine, particularly if Russia decides to exploit this weakness,\u201d said Michael A. Horowitz, a geopolitical and security analyst who is the head of intelligence at the Le Beck consultancy.",
      "\u201cThe spat is public. Russia knows about this, so they will try to take advantage.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG \u2014\u00a0Hong Kong media tycoon and pro-democracy advocate\u00a0Jimmy\u00a0Lai\u00a0finished testifying in court on Thursday in a landmark national security trial where he stands accused of colluding with foreign forces and sedition.",
      "Thursday marked day 144 of the trial against\u00a0Lai\u00a0and his 52nd day in the witness box, after which he thanked the judges and waved to his supporters.",
      "Lai, 77, founder of the Apple Daily newspaper that was forced to close after a police raid and asset freeze in June 2021, has pleaded not guilty to two charges of\u00a0conspiracy to collude with foreign forces, and a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai, whose\u00a0health is fragile\u00a0according to his family, faces a possible life sentence under a China-imposed national security law. Some countries, including the U.S. and Britain, have called for his immediate release alleging the trial is political.",
      "Lai\u2019s plight has become a friction point between the U.S. and China, with President Donald Trump saying he would \u201cone hundred percent\u201d get\u00a0Lai\u00a0out of the country.",
      "Over weeks of testimony,\u00a0Lai\u00a0spoke candidly on topics including his defense of free speech and the media, while\u00a0rejecting allegations\u00a0by the prosecution that he had lobbied the U.S. to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and China.",
      "He also remained defiant in the face of intense cross-examination. In one exchange he called himself a \u201cpolitical prisoner\u201d only for one judge, Esther Toh, to reject that and say\u00a0Lai\u00a0was in court to face a criminal charge.\u00a0Lai\u00a0said he had the right to disagree.",
      "Before concluding his cross-examination, prosecutor Anthony Chau read out the three charges, alleged conspiracies and co-conspirators, and asked\u00a0Lai\u00a0if he agreed with them.",
      "\u201cOf course I disagree. Totally rubbish,\u201d\u00a0Lai\u00a0said.",
      "Lai\u00a0added that he did not even know one of the alleged co-conspirators, Andy Li.",
      "Lai\u00a0has been held in solitary confinement for more than 1,500 days since December 2020.",
      "Former Vice President Mike Pence, speaking in Hong Kong in January, called on Beijing to end\u00a0Lai\u2019s ordeal.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s probably no more compelling gesture in the short term, to send a message of goodwill to the people of the United States or the free world, than if China were to take steps to free\u00a0Jimmy\u00a0Lai,\u201d Pence said at a closed-door investor conference, a recording of which was reviewed by Reuters.",
      "Hong Kong authorities say\u00a0Lai\u2019s trial is fair and the national security law has brought stability after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019.",
      "No firm date has been set for a verdict, but a judge recently indicated it could come in October."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Twelve Chinese nationals \u2014 including mercenary hackers, law enforcement officers and employees of a private hacking company \u2014 have been charged in connection with global cybercrime campaigns targeting dissidents, news organizations, U.S. agencies and universities, the Justice Department said Wednesday.",
      "A set of criminal cases filed in New York and Washington add new detail to what U.S. officials say is a booming hacking-for-hire ecosystem in China, in which private companies and contractors are paid by the Chinese government to target victims of particular interest to Beijing in an arrangement meant to provide Chinese state security forces cover and deniability.",
      "The indictments come as the U.S. government has warned of an increasingly sophisticated cyber threat from China, such as a hack last year of telecom firms called Salt Typhoon that gave Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans, including U.S. government officials and prominent public figures.",
      "One indictment charges eight leaders and employees of a private hacking company known as I-Soon with conducting a sweeping array of computer breaches around the world meant to suppress speech, locate dissidents and steal data from victims. Among those charged is Wu Haibo, who founded I-Soon in Shanghai in 2010 and was a member of China\u2019s first hacktivist group, Green Army, and who is accused in the indictment of overseeing and directing hacking operations.",
      "Earlier reporting by The Associated Press on leaked documents from I-Soon mainly showed I-Soon was targeting a wide range of governments such as India, Taiwan or Mongolia, but little on the United States.",
      "But the indictment contains new revelations about I-Soon\u2019s activities targeting a wide range of Chinese dissidents, religious organizations and media outlets based in the U.S., including a newspaper identified as publishing news related to China and opposed to the Chinese Communist Party. Other targets included individual critics of China living in the U.S., the Defense Intelligence Agency and a research university.",
      "The intended targets were in some cases directed by China\u2019s Ministry of Public Security \u2014 two law enforcement officers were charged with tasking certain assignments \u2014 but in other instances the hackers acted at their own initiative and tried to sell the stolen information to the government afterward, the indictment says.",
      "The company charged the Chinese government the equivalent of between approximately $10,000 and $75,000 for each email inbox it successfully hacked, officials said.",
      "Phone numbers listed for I-Soon on a Chinese corporate registry rang unanswered, and I-Soon representatives did not immediately respond to an AP email requesting comment.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, Liu Pengyu, suggested Wednesday that the allegations were a \u201csmear\u201d and said, \u201cWe hope that relevant parties will adopt a professional and responsible attitude and base their characterization of cyber incidents on sufficient evidence rather than groundless speculation and accusations.\u201d",
      "A separate indictment charges two other Chinese hackers, identified as Yin Kecheng and Zhou Shuai, in a for-profit hacking campaign that targeted victims including U.S. technology companies, think tanks, defense contractors and health care systems. Among the targets was the U.S. Treasury Department, which disclosed a breach by Chinese actors late last year in what it called a \u201cmajor cybersecurity incident.\u201d",
      "The Treasury Department announced sanctions Wednesday in connection with the hacking, and the State Department announced multimillion-dollar rewards for information about the defendants.",
      "I-Soon is part of a sprawling industry in China, documented in an AP investigation last year, of private hacking contractors that steal data from other countries to sell to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Over the past two decades, Chinese state security\u2019s demand for overseas intelligence has soared, giving rise to a vast network of these private hackers-for-hire companies that have infiltrated hundreds of systems outside China.",
      "China\u2019s hacking industry rose in the early days of the internet, when Wu and other Chinese hackers declared themselves \u201cred hackers\u201d \u2014 patriots who offered their services to the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast to the anti-establishment ethos popular among many coders.",
      "The indictment \u201cproved the close ties and interaction among China\u2019s first generation patriotic hackers,\u201d said Mei Danowski, a cybersecurity analyst who wrote about I-Soon on her blog, Natto Thoughts. They \u201call turned to entrepreneurs now \u2014 doing businesses with the governments and making profits through other means.\u201d",
      "Since I-Soon documents were leaked online last year, the company has been suffering but is still in operation, according to Chinese corporate records. They\u2019ve downsized and moved offices.",
      "\u201cApparently i-SOON companies have been struggling to survive,\u201d Danowski wrote on her blog. \u201cTo Chinese state agencies, a company like i-SOON is disposable.\u201d"

      "The South Korean military said the training in Pocheon, a northeastern city of about 140,000 people near the heavily fortified border with North Korea, was in preparation for Freedom Shield, an annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercise that is set to kick off on Monday.",
      "Just after 10 a.m. local time (8 p.m. Wednesday ET), eight 500-pound MK-82 bombs were \u201cabnormally released\u201d by two air force KF-16s, landing outside the designated firing range, the South Korean Air Force said.",
      "The air force said four of the bombs misfired because one of the fighter jet pilots entered incorrect coordinates during the flight preparation process, and that further investigation was needed to determine\u00a0why the second jet incorrectly dropped the four other bombs.",
      "\u201cThere are procedures to verify coordinates both on the ground and in the air. However, it appears that a mistake was made in this process,\u201d South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.",
      "The JCS said live-fire drills were being suspended but that the Freedom Shield exercise would go ahead as planned.",
      "Two of the 15 people were civilians with serious but not life-threatening injuries, fire authorities told reporters. Those with minor injuries included two soldiers who were at a military chapel and two foreign nationals who were in the area.",
      "Eight buildings also sustained damage, officials said, including the chapel, five houses, one warehouse and one greenhouse.",
      "Photographs from the scene showed debris at the church and residences with shattered windows. Residents were being evacuated as authorities searched for any unexploded bombs.",
      "The fighter jet was participating in a combined live-fire exercise involving both the South Korean Air Force and Army, the air force said.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely regret the civilian damage caused by this accidental release and wish for the swift recovery of the injured,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Air Force will actively implement all necessary measures, including compensation for damages.\u201d",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Hong Kong\u2019s top court on Thursday overturned the convictions of three former organizers of an annual vigil in remembrance of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown over their refusal to provide information to police, marking a rare victory for the Chinese territory\u2019s pro-democracy activists.",
      "Chow Hang-tung, Tang Ngok-kwan and Tsui Hon-kwong \u2014 core members of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China \u2014 were convicted in 2023 during Beijing\u2019s crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement. They received a sentence of 4 1/2 months and have already served their terms.",
      "The alliance was long known for organizing candlelight vigils in the city on the anniversary of the Chinese military\u2019s crushing of the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Beijing. But it voted to disband in 2021 under the shadow of a sweeping national security law imposed by China.",
      "Critics said the shutdown and the case showed that the city\u2019s Western-style civil liberties were shrinking despite promises they would be kept intact when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Before the group dissolved, police had sought details about its operations and finances in connection with alleged links to pro-democracy groups overseas, accusing it of being a foreign agent. But the group refused to cooperate, insisting it was not.",
      "On Thursday, judges at the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal unanimously ruled in the trio\u2019s favor. Chief Justice Andrew Cheung announced the decision in court.",
      "The prosecution needed to prove that the alliance was a foreign agent, the judges wrote, adding that the lower courts \u201cfell into error\u201d in holding that it was sufficient merely that the police commissioner said he had reasonable grounds to believe the alliance was a foreign agent.",
      "In a lower court trial, the appellants also took issue with crucial details that were redacted, including the names of groups that were alleged to have links with the alliance.",
      "The judges ruled that by redacting the only potential evidential basis for establishing that the alliance was a foreign agent, the prosecution disabled itself from proving its case.",
      "\u201cNon\u2013disclosure of the redacted facts in any event deprived the appellants of a fair trial,\u201d they wrote.",
      "After the ruling, Tang told reporters outside the court that he hoped the top court\u2019s ruling proved that the alliance was not a foreign agent and that in the future they could prove that the 1989 movement was not a counter-revolutionary riot.",
      "\u201cJustice lives in people\u2019s hearts. Regardless of the outcome, everyone knows the truth in their hearts,\u201d he said.",
      "During an earlier hearing at the top court in January, Chow, who represented herself, said her case highlighted what a police state is.",
      "\u201cA police state is created by the complicity of the court in endorsing such abuses. This kind of complicity must stop now,\u201d she said.",
      "Since the security law was introduced in 2020, several non-permanent overseas judges have quit the top court, raising questions over confidence in the city\u2019s judicial system. In 2024, Jonathan Sumption quit his position and said the rule of law was profoundly compromised.",
      "But Cheung in January said the judges\u2019 premature departures did not mean the judiciary\u2019s independence was weakening.",
      "The annual vigil at Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Park was the only large-scale public commemoration of the June 4 crackdown on Chinese soil for decades. Thousands attended it annually until authorities banned it in 2020, citing anti-pandemic measures.",
      "After Covid-19 restrictions were lifted, the park was occupied instead by a carnival organized by pro-Beijing groups. Those who tried to commemorate the event near the site were detained.",
      "Chow and two other former alliance leaders, Lee Cheuk-yan and Albert Ho, were charged with subversion in a separate case under the security law. They remain in custody, awaiting the beginning of their trial.",

      "Mohammad Sharifullah was taken into custody over the weekend and admitted during an FBI interrogation to being a member of the Islamic State group\u2019s affiliate in Afghanistan and to his role in the August 2021 suicide bombing and other attacks, according to U.S. officials.",

And he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice.\u201d",
      "Senior Pakistani intelligence officers on Wednesday confirmed the arrest and said Sharifullah, also known as Jafar, was captured in the country\u2019s restive southwest Balochistan province near the border with Afghanistan after multiple operations had failed to seize him.",
      "Sharifullah is charged in federal court in Virginia with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization, resulting in death. He wore a light-blue jail jumpsuit and listened through headphones as an interpreter translated the proceedings. His public defender declined to comment after his court appearance, which ended with him being held until at least a detention hearing set for Monday.",
      "The Abbey Gate bombing, in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover of the country amid the withdrawal by U.S. forces from the country, occurred in August 2021 when a suicide bomber attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul\u2019s airport. Besides 13 U.S. service members, about 170 Afghans were also killed in the attack, which triggered widespread congressional criticism and undermined public confidence in the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the conclusion of the war.",
      "According to an FBI affidavit filed as part of the case, Sharifullah admitted under questioning to having joined the Afghanistan-based Islamic State-Khorasan, also known as ISIS-K, in 2016. He told investigators that he was in prison from 2019 until about two weeks before the bombing, at which point he was contacted by another ISIS-K member about helping in the attack, the affidavit said.",
      "He was given a motorcycle, funds for a cellphone and a SIM card, as well as instructions for communicating via social media during the attack operation, prosecutors said. He admitted to participating in the Abbey Gate attack by scouting a route to the airport for the bomber and communicating to other members of the militant group that the path was clear.",
      "Sharifullah said he was instructed to leave the area and later learned that the bombing was done by an ISIS-K operative he had met while jailed, the affidavit said.",
      "The bomber was identified as Abdul Rahman al-Logari, an Islamic State group militant who had been in an Afghan prison but was released by the Taliban as the group took control of the country that summer.",

      "Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for \u201cacknowledging and appreciating\u201d the country\u2019s role in counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to partner closely with the United States in securing regional peace and stability,\u201d Sharif said on the social media platform X.",
      "From Kabul, the Taliban chief spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid declined to comment beyond saying that the arrest \u201con Pakistani soil\u201d of an Afghan national and member of the Islamic State group shows that IS group figures \u201chave taken refuge and established havens\u201d inside Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThis issue has nothing to do with Afghanistan,\u201d Mujahid said. The regional Islamic State affiliate is a rival group to the Afghan Taliban."
