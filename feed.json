    "story": [
      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a \u2014 you know \u2014 enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cThe Secret Agent,\u201d a Brazilian feature shortlisted for the Oscars, is all about ordinary people. It follows an unassuming scientist and widowed father who becomes a target of Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship in the 1970s \u2014 not because he is an activist or revolutionary, but because he stands up to a business owner with ties to the regime.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s in danger simply for being who he is, for holding the values he holds,\u201d star Wagner Moura told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cThat\u2019s how authoritarianism works everywhere.\u201d",
      "Directed by Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d has been hailed by critics as one of the year\u2019s best films and arrives amid a renewed international interest in Brazilian cinema. Expanding in U.S. theaters Friday, the film is backed by major wins at the Cannes Film Festival for both Mendon\u00e7a Filho (best director) and Moura (best actor).",
      "Earlier this month, the 2 1/2-hour thriller earned Golden Globe nominations for best drama, best non-English film and best actor in a drama.",
      "\u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d arrives at a strong moment for Brazilian cinema following the success of \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d which won this year\u2019s Oscar for best international feature and a Golden Globe for lead actor Fernanda Torres.",
      "In Brazil, expectations for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d are high. Moura said the widespread enthusiasm around the film \u2014 and the public's engagement with Brazilian artists \u2014 has made him \u201cincredibly happy.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo country develops without culture, without identity,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re watching a Brazilian film, seeing a part of Brazil and its history. That matters.\u201d",
      "Set in 1977, at the height of Brazil\u2019s dictatorship, \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d opens with a black-and-white montage of the era\u2019s national symbols, from movie classics to hit soap operas.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho anchors the story in a precise time and place: Carnival in Recife, the filmmaker's hometown in northeastern Brazil. As the center of his cinematic universe, the city is the set for confronting a country that still struggles to reckon with its past.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all consumed incredible things from so many places \u2014 from Akira Kurosawa in Japan to Elvis Presley in the American South,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cI am Brazilian, and my film is Brazilian. If it\u2019s good, it will be universal.\u201d",
      "Living undercover and under the alias Marcelo, Armando spends his days scouring archives for clues about his mother\u2019s past and planning to flee the country with his young son. As his quiet quest unfolds, the streets outside explode with Carnival revelry \u2014 a festival so embedded in Brazilian life that even the police chief appears rumpled from the celebrations, confetti still clinging to his hair.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho blends political suspense with urban legends from the period, touching on themes that extend beyond the dictatorship itself, including corruption, state violence and institutional complicity.",
      "One pivotal sequence unfolds inside a movie theater, a nod to the director\u2019s lifelong cinephilia. As fictional audiences spill out of screenings of \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cThe Omen,\u201d shaken by fictional threats, the country itself is living under real terror.",
      "Over the past decade, Brazilian cinema has increasingly revisited the military dictatorship, which ruled from 1964 to 1985. Alongside \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m Still Here,\u201d filmmakers have returned to the period in works such as \u201cMarighella,\u201d directed by Moura, about the legendary guerrilla leader who took up arms against the regime.",
      "Many of these films were made or released in the past decade, amid the rise of Brazil\u2019s far right. Its most prominent figure was former President Jair Bolsonaro, a retired army captain who praised officers accused of torture and minimized state crimes committed during the dictatorship.",
      "Mendon\u00e7a Filho is among the filmmakers who have taken on the task of confronting national memory.",
      "\u201cThe military is a trauma that was never truly examined,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018Move on, forget it.\u2019 A crust forms over it. The same thing happens to an entire nation.\u201d",

      "The character, who shelters political fugitives including Armando, stands out. When she walks toward the camera in a flowered dress, cigarette in hand, the film briefly belongs to her.",
      "\u201cHer authenticity carries something of many women I\u2019ve known,\u201d Mendon\u00e7a Filho said. \u201cThere\u2019s something literary about her.\u201d",

      "Four influential female directors took part in this year's Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah, paving the way for more diverse narratives in Arab cinema.",
      "The festival, bringing together 38 directors, showcases Saudi Arabia's heavy investment in film, gaming and sports as part of its broader transformation efforts.

The film deals with themes of Palestinian displacement and personal loss.",
      "\u201cIt tells the story of one family over three generations and how they survive the Nakba in 1948 and the ongoing occupation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives people context for how we got to where we are today and shows how much Palestinians have had to endure throughout the decades.\u201d",
      "Dabis, born and raised in the United States to Palestinian-Jordanian parents, said her passion and inspiration to become a filmmaker grew from a lack of authentic Arab and Palestinian representation in Western media. \u201cI became aware that I wanted to go into storytelling in order to tell our authentic stories, because I couldn\u2019t find us anywhere,\u201d she said.",
      "She said growing up in the U.S. offered better opportunities for a career in cinema than the Arab world, but the racism her family faced reinforced her desire to challenge harmful stereotypes. \u201cMy experience in the diaspora is really what compelled me to become a storyteller,\u201d she said.",
      "And she still struggled to be taken seriously, feeling pressure to adopt a more authoritative, even masculine tone to counter assumptions about women directors. \"There is this image of women filmmakers as overly emotional or unable to command a set,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us felt we had to overcome these unfair ideas.\u201d",

      "She said filmmaking remains an uncertain path for Arab women, demanding constant perseverance with no guarantees of success. \u201cEvery film is a new beginning,\u201d she said, noting that directors must repeatedly convince investors, festivals and audiences of their vision.",

      "The film resonated deeply with audiences for capturing the emotional duality of life in the Palestinian territories. \u201cPeople told me they saw so much of themselves in it. It\u2019s how life is in Palestine \u2014 joy turns into mourning, then back into joy. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope,\u201d she said.",

Egypt really embraced me.\u201d",

That\u2019s why our voices matter,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean men can\u2019t write about women \u2014 it just means that certain emotional details only women can fully bring to the screen.\u201d",
      "Zain Duraie said her love with filmmaking began as a 10-year-old watching \u201cTitanic\u201d with her father in Amman, Jordan.

That spark turned into a passion nurtured by school theater and later refined at the Toronto Film School.",

      "Duraie started her career at the bottom, taking on every role she could from production assistant, assistant director, producer, before directing her own films. \u201cI carried heavy equipment up mountains,\u201d she recalled. \u201cPeople told me, \u2018This isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d but that only pushed her further. \u201cI worked in everything in filmmaking. I wanted to learn it all.\u201d",
      "Duraie is known for tackling deeply personal and social issues, especially around mental health and the female experience. \u201cI love to work in the psychology of drama, and I want to tell stories about women \u2014 but break stereotypes too,\u201d she said. She said Arab cinema is not there yet when it comes to gender inclusion.",

      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",

      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",

It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material.

      "\u201cHollywood has taken a lot of criticism by those in the faith community for not providing films that speak to them, that reflect their values,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst, emphasizing the box-office potential of faith-based films.",
      "Studios are realizing faith-based film and television is a worthwhile investment at least in part due to the success of \u201cThe Chosen,\u201d which Angel helped launch in 2017, even if it initially took time to see those results.",
      "\u201cIt was like pulling teeth to get people to watch it,\u201d recalled Angel CEO and co-founder Neal Harmon. \u201cPeople have this idea that faith means cheesy or preachy. And we had to break through that barrier.\u201d",
      "Once they did, it paid off. Since Fathom Entertainment began distributing \u201cThe Chosen\u201d theatrically in 2023, the series has grossed more than $116 million domestically.",
      "Though not a Christian company, Angel aims to distribute and market \u201cvalues-based entertainment\u201d that includes but is not limited to stories of faith. They\u2019ve released a host of religious films, with \u201cZero A.D.,\u201d a biblical epic about the Massacre of the Innocents recounted in the Gospel of Matthew, on the docket for 2026.",
      "Meanwhile, Lionsgate is set to premiere \u201cI Can Only Imagine 2\u201d in theaters February, a sequel to the 2018 biopic starring Dennis Quaid, which was one of the highest-grossing Christian films of all-time in the United States.",
      "Co-director Andrew Erwin said he noticed a \u201cmassive shift\u201d take place about five years ago, after years of disconnect between the demand for these kinds of films and Hollywood\u2019s willingness to make them.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, movie studios are really giving us a fair shake,\u201d he said, though he thinks the quality of the content was also a factor. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have the knowledge of how to do the filmmaking side of things. And so, I think the storytelling has gotten a lot better.\u201d",
      "Lionsgate is also set to distribute the first of Gibson\u2019s two-part sequel to \u201cThe Passion of the Christ\u201d in 2027.",
      "Trying to define what counts as faith-based programming is a bit like trying to define what counts as pornography.",

      "Tennessee Williams' early radio play, \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d is featured in The Strand this week",
      "NEW YORK -- Long before the rise of podcast dramas, listeners worldwide tuned in to the audio-only narratives of radio plays.",
      "Tom Stoppard and Arthur Miller were among the many playwrights who early in their careers completed brief pieces for radio, while such memorable dramas as Harold Pinter's \u201cA Slight Ache\u201d and Robert Bolt's \u201cA Man for All Seasons\u201d premiered as radio broadcasts. Radio work was often a way to bring in money and to refine the arts of plotting and dialogue.",
      "When Tennessee Williams was a student at the University of Iowa in the late 1930s, still referring to himself by his birth name, Tom Williams, he completed a rarely-heard gothic sketch for radio called \u201cThe Strangers.\u201d Williams' play appears this week in The Strand Magazine, which has previously published little-known works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner and John Steinbeck among others.",
      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

Bak believes Williams was influenced by commercial considerations and by more personal forces.",
      "Horror stories were popular on radio in the late '30s, Bak says. Williams first thought of radio plays as an \u201cexercise,\u201d but he would eventually take them more seriously. While writing \u201cThe Strangers,\u201d he was already haunted by the mental health struggles of his sister, Rose, who would later inspire the fragile Laura Wingfield of \u201cThe Glass Menagerie.\u201d Williams would long explore the idea of madness, Bak says, and how we respond to people who seem to see things \u201cno one else can see.\u201d",

      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",
      "\u201cWe had a very loud house,\u201d a smiling Briggs said. \u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Battle of the Bands.\u2019 It was a lot of fun.

      "The ongoing strike at the Louvre has become a major test of the museum's management",
      "PARIS -- The ongoing strike at the Louvre is no longer just a labor dispute. It has become a test of how securely, credibly and competently the world\u2019s most visited museum is being run.",
      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",
      "The October daylight robbery, in which thieves stole crown jewels, intensified scrutiny from lawmakers and auditors and reframing workplace complaints as questions of institutional failure.",
      "Culture Ministry officials have tried to defuse the standoff by proposing to cancel a planned 2026 funding cut, hire additional guards and visitor services staff, and raise pay. Unions rejected the measures as inadequate, signaling that trust has frayed beyond quick fixes.",
      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",
      "French senators were told last week that thieves who stole crown jewels valued at more than $100 million escaped the Louvre with barely 30 seconds to spare, a detail that crystallized the scale of the breakdown.",

    "story": [
      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri's top prosecutor said China is suing after the state pressed federal officials for help collecting on a roughly $25 billion court judgment related to the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said Tuesday in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government also is seeking compensation equivalent to $50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of the new case. But he said the earlier Missouri lawsuit was \u201ca purely politically motivated maneuver.\u201d",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes it, will never accept it, and reserves the right to take strong countermeasures,\u201d Pengyu said.",

U.S. District Judge Stephen Limbaugh initially dismissed the lawsuit in 2022, saying Missouri couldn\u2019t sue China, its Communist Party and seven other government or scientific agencies. But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",
      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",

      "In September, Marrazzo filed a complaint alleging whistleblower retaliation with the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, and publicly shared her concerns. Weeks later she was fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in Maryland that claims violations of whistleblower protections.",
      "In a statement issued by her lawyers, Marrazzo said the lawsuit \"is about protecting not just my right to expose abuse and fraud by our government but those rights for all federal employees, so we can safeguard essential public health priorities and the integrity of scientific research.\u201d",

      "\u201cTo be stuck in the hospital and feel like the world is moving on without you outside feels a little bit isolating, a little lonely, feels like maybe you\u2019ve been forgotten in the hustle and bustle of the holiday season,\u201d said Amanda Lefkof, a child life specialist at Corewell.",
      "Among the children in the hospital is 4-year-old Zoe Hostetter, who is undergoing chemotherapy treatments. On a recent night, she shone her own flashlight toward the bundled-up well-wishers below with her grandfather, Tim Schuele, by her side.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a big group of people that they don\u2019t know, but they see the love being sent by the lights,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re here kind of by themselves or with just close family and that\u2019s it for days.\u201d",

      "Kevin Barringer was among those flashing lights toward the windows one night last week. Barringer's son, Connor, spent two months at the hospital in 2020 recovering from a spinal injury, and they were on the receiving end of the lights.",
      "\u201cIt gets pretty dark up there for the kids and for parents as well,\u201d Kevin Barringer said. \u201cHaving people down here letting them up there know that there are people with them and sending all their light up that way, it means a lot.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

      "The diagnosis is not universally accepted, and some psychologists argue that low sex drive should not be considered a medical problem.",
      "The FDA rejected Addyi twice prior to its 2015 approval, citing the drug's modest effectiveness and worrisome side effects. The approval came after a lobbying campaign by the company and its supporters, Even the Score, which framed the lack of options for female libido as a women's rights issue.",

      "Susan Monarez was fired as the CDC\u2019s director and Dr. Debra Houry resigned as the agency\u2019s chief medical officer and deputy director over disputes about changes at the agency. The two will work with California's public health department to help build trust in \u201cscience-driven decision-making,\u201d Newsom's office said.",
      "\u201cWe're not just wringing our hands right now \u2014 we're fighting back,\u201d Newsom said at a news conference. \u201cThis is a substantive response to what is not happening in Washington.\u201d",
      "California has increasingly positioned itself as a counterweight to federal health policy, and Newsom has amped up his criticisms of President Donald Trump and challenged the Republican's policies in court. The governor's final term ends in just over a year, and he's gearing up for a possible presidential run in 2028.",
      "California joined Washington and Oregon \u2014 two other states with Democratic governors \u2014 to launch an alliance in September to establish their own public health guidance and vaccine recommendations, as the Trump administration makes sweeping changes to vaccine and health policy.",
      "California state Sen. Tony Strickland, a Republican, said the initiative announced Monday is an example of Newsom prioritizing his national political ambitions over the state.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has serious problems, and we need serious solutions from a serious leader,\u201d Strickland said in a statement.",
      "The White House and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to emails seeking comment on the Monarez and Houry hirings.",
      "Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeated falsehoods about vaccines, and the administration has given health recommendations this year that experts say were not backed by science.",
      "Trump in September urged pregnant women not to take Tylenol, saying it could pose a risk of autism to their babies, remarks medical experts said were irresponsible. The CDC website was changed last month to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. A federal vaccine advisory panel voted earlier this month to reverse decades-old guidance recommending that all U.S. babies get immunized against the liver infection hepatitis B on the day they're born. The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "Houry, who spent more than a decade at the CDC, was among a handful of top officials at the agency who resigned around the time Monarez was fired. Houry said in August she was concerned about the rise of vaccine misinformation during the Trump administration, as well as planned budget cuts, reorganization and firings at the CDC.",

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

      "But he had no choice, and so his daily drudgery began. Each morning, he wakes at 7 and walks for half an hour to the factory to pick up the treats. Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",
      "There are boys like Arfan all over the camps, selling food they\u2019re desperate to eat and collecting trash in exchange for cash, shoulders slumped with exhaustion, skin seared by the sun.",
      "In a drainage ditch next to a row of stinking latrines, 13-year-old Rahamot Ullah wades up to his waist in water clouded with raw sewage, plucking from the muck discarded pieces of plastic. Five hours of rummaging through the waste will generally net him enough plastic to trade for around 50 taka (40 cents).",
      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",
      "\u201cI feel shame working,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the time I should be studying.\u201d",
      "Each night when the sun sets, Arfan packs up and heads back to his shelter. And it is here where he lies on a mat on the bamboo floor, crying himself to sleep and pining for the life he was forced to leave behind.",
      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro, who has been serving a 27-year prison sentence for an attempted coup since November, was granted permission on Friday to leave prison for a hernia surgery. The date of the surgery has not been announced.",
      "Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes gave the far-right leader the go-ahead after federal police doctors confirmed he needs the procedure.",

      "After Sri Lanka struggled through one of the worst storms in its history, tea plantation workers are taking temporary refuge in government schools and temples as entire villages were buried in mud in the central highlands",
      "CRAIGHEAD ESTATE, Sri Lanka -- Arumugam Manikavalli, awakened by ferocious rain and rumbling earth, fled her home for the safety of a nearby temple on the tea estate where she works. That same November evening, tea worker Kumaran Elumugam's small home was crushed by a landslide, killing six family members.",
      "He survived only because he was away, at work, along with a daughter.",
      "\u201cMy wife, son-in-law, daughter, mother-in-law, two grandsons are all dead,\u201d Elumugam lamented. \u201cThe small one (granddaughter) is still under the mud.\u201d",
      "Elumugum and Manikavalli were among the fortunate to reach safety as heavy rains from Cyclone Ditwah led to floods and landslides across the South Asian island nation, killing more than 640 people and leaving more than a hundred missing. Multiple villages were submerged by landslides that left behind a rubble of cement, wood and roofing. In one area, the wreckage was dotted with clothing, schoolbooks, toys and a sports trophy.",
      "Among the hardest hit were the hilly regions in the island's center and the tea plantation workers who live there. Many occupied primitive, 150-year-old structures that were swept away in landslides and flooding. Social workers said these plantation workers, already living in extremely distressed conditions, are now in an even more desperate situation.",
      "Most tea plantation workers in Sri Lanka belong to the Malaiyaha Tamil ethnic group. Descendants of Tamil indentured laborers who were brought to work from southern India by British colonists more than 200 years ago, over 1 million people belong to this community, the fourth-largest ethnic group on the island.",
      "Sri Lanka grows some of the world's finest tea, bringing billions of dollars into the country. But most Tamils in the hill regions earn well below the minimum wage of 1,200 rupees ($4) per day, with little or no access to education, health care or good jobs.",
      "A report by the American Institute for Sri Lankan Studies said most tea plantation workers own no land or homes and are living in colonial-era working quarters barely bigger than 100 square feet but accommodating as many as eight family members. Multiple houses share bathrooms or have no sanitary facilities.",
      "Many of the tea plantations, on flatter ground, were unaffected by the cyclone while the workers' homes, which were closer to mountain slopes, were destroyed, said Melanie Gunathilaka, a Colombo-based climate activist and researcher.",
      "\u201cThe settlements were in much more dangerous areas,\" she said. \u201cThis shows the amount of value placed on the lives of these people.\u201d",
      "The Planters Association of Ceylon, the association for Sri Lanka's tea companies and estates, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The government said more than 100,000 houses were destroyed or damaged across Sri Lanka. It has promised compensation packages to rebuild houses or to find safer lands and build new houses.",
      "Sundaralingam Pradeep, Sri Lanka's deputy minister for plantations and community infrastructure, told The Associated Press that the government is negotiating with the tea companies to identify lands to build homes for all those affected by the disaster, including retirees still living in company line houses.",
      "The minister said an Indian-assisted project to build 7,000 homes will provide the first batch of houses for the impacted workers.",
      "Tea workers say help can't come soon enough.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel safe to be living here,\u201d said Karuppiah Kamani, pointing to a huge rock next to her home at the edge of a tea plantation.",
      "Sellamuttu Darshani Devi, another tea worker, and her family were asked to move as a precaution after the worst landslides. That's been routine for years, she said. Her house has so far been unaffected, but she's afraid to go back now.",

      "Sri Lanka accounts for less than 1% of planet-warming gases in the atmosphere but is considered among nations most at risk from the extreme weather made worse by climate change.",
      "According to the United Nations, Sri Lanka loses more than $300 million every year from climate-triggered extreme weather. At least 750,000 people are affected every year by extreme weather and nearly 19 million of Sri Lanka's 23 million people live in low-lying, landslide-prone or other disaster-vulnerable areas.",
      "But building resilience is difficult. The country owes billions of dollars to the International Monetary Fund, other multilateral development banks, countries such as China, Japan and India and some private banks and private lenders. Sri Lanka is highly dependent on tourism, which was hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Severe economic problems led to mass protests and the eventual ouster of the nation's established political elite.",
      "\u201cIn countries like Sri Lanka, disasters don\u2019t break the system. What disasters do is they expose the already broken systems,\u201d said Sandun Thudugala of the Colombo-based nonprofit Law and Society Trust. Thudugala said Sri Lanka needs to rethink how it builds and plans, he said, taking into account a future where extreme weather is the norm.",
      "Climate activist Gunathilaka said the country's debt burden has forced it to prioritize economic growth above everything else so they can repay on time. She said that Sri Lanka could prioritize building climate-resilient homes, invest in early warning infrastructure and have more money to respond to disasters if they didn't have to worry about the billions in loans and high interest rates that they come attached with.",

      "The couple pleaded not guilty when they were indicted last year. They were accused of selling the gifts, including jewelry from Saudi Arabia\u2019s government, at prices far below their market value while he was in office.",

      "Khan\u2019s spokesperson, Zulfiquar Bukhari, said the verdict in the graft case ignored basic principles of justice. In a statement, he said that the \u201ccriminal liability was imposed without proof of intent, gain, or loss, relying instead on a retrospective reinterpretation of rules.",

      "El-Sissi made the plea for a \u201cmore pluralistic\u201d world order at a conference of the Russia-Africa partnership held in Cairo, which was attended by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and ministers from more than 50 African countries along with representatives from several African and regional organizations.",
      "\u201cThe voice of Africa should be present and influential in making global decisions given the continent\u2019s human, economic, political and demographic weight,\u201d el-Sissi said in a statement read out by his foreign minister at the plenary session of the conference. He added that international financial institutions need to undergo similar reforms to ensure Africa an equitable representation.",
      "Since 2005, the African Union has been demanding that Africa be granted at least two permanent seats with veto powers and five non-permanent seats in the Security Council. It has been arguing that such reforms would contribute to achieving peace and stability on the continent, which has been struggling with wars for decades. However, African countries have so far failed to reach a consensus on a mechanism to select their potential permanent representatives.",
      "\u201cWe have decided to continue coordinating our efforts in various multilateral forums, including with the aim of promoting reform of the U.N. Security Council, taking into account the legitimate interests of African states,\u201d Lavrov told reporters in a joint news conference with his Egyptian counterpart.",
      "The Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has not changed from its 1945 configuration: 10 non-permanent members from all regions of the world elected for two-year terms without veto power, and five countries that were dominant powers at the end of World War II are permanent members with veto power: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.",
      "Lavrov said earlier the ministerial conference launched talks aimed at developing an action plan for cooperation for the years 2026-2029. The plan will be presented to heads of state at the Russia-Africa summit scheduled for next year.",

      "Even though Belarus has released dozens of prisoners, those who've been freed say the authoritarian government often delivers one final act of repression by confiscating their passports before deporting them",
      "TALLINN, Estonia -- The only official document human rights advocate Uladzimir Labkovich had with him when he was suddenly released from a Belarus prison, blindfolded and driven to neighboring Ukraine was a piece of paper with his name and mugshot on it.",
      "\u201cAfter four and half years of abuse in prison, I was thrown out of my own country without a passport or valid documents,\u201d Labkovich told The Associated Press by phone from Ukraine on Wednesday. \u201cThis is yet another dirty trick by the Belarusian authorities, who continue to make our lives difficult.\u201d",
      "Labkovich, 47, was one of 123 prisoners released by Belarus on Dec. 13 in exchange for the U.S. lifting some trade sanctions on the authoritarian government of President Alexander Lukashenko. All but nine were taken to Ukraine; the rest \u2014 including Nobel Peace Prize laureate Ales Bialiatski \u2014 were driven to Lithuania.",
      "A close ally of Russia, Lukashenko has ruled his nation of 9.5 million with an iron fist for over three decades. Belarus has faced years of Western isolation and sanctions for its crackdown on human rights and for allowing Moscow to use its territory in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Recently, Lukashenko has sought better relations with the West, releasing hundreds of prisoners since July 2024.",
      "But in a final act of indignity and repression, the newly freed prisoners often are not told they are being deported without passports or other identity papers. They must rebuild their lives abroad, facing bureaucratic obstacles without any help from their homeland.",
      "Because he was blindfolded, Labkovich said he and others could only tell they were heading south. At least 18 prisoners taken to Ukraine \u2014 including Labkovich and Belarusian opposition figures Vitkar Babaryka and Maria Kolesnikova \u2014 had no documents with them, according to rights advocates. Germany has promised to provide shelter to Babaryka and Kolesnikova.",
      "\u201cI dream of hugging my three children and wife in (the Lithuanian capital) Vilnius, but instead I have to deal with absurd bureaucratic procedures,\u201d Labkovich said.",
      "Belarusian opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled the country in 2020, told AP in written comments that the way the prisoners were taken out of Belarus was \u201ca forced deportation in violation of all international norms and regulations,\u201d adding it was inhumane treatment.",
      "\u201cEven after pardoning people, Lukashenko continues to retaliate against them,\u201d Tsikhanouskaya said. \u201cThey bar people from staying in the country, they forcibly drive them out of Belarus without documents in order to humiliate them even further.\u201d",
      "In September, Lukashenko pardoned more than 50 political prisoners who were taken to the Lithuanian border.",
      "One of them, prominent opposition activist Mikola Statkevich refused to leave Belarus. The 69-year-old, who called the government\u2019s actions a \u201cforced deportation,\u201d pushed his way out of the bus and stayed for several hours in the no-man\u2019s land between the borders before being taken away by Belarusian police and returned to prison.",
      "Fourteen others who had crossed into Lithuania from the September release didn't have passports. Freed activist Mikalai Dziadok said Belarusian security operatives tore up his passport in front of him. Freed journalist Ihar Losik said all of his papers \u2014 including diaries \u2014 were confiscated.",
      "\u201cMy passport was simply stolen. We came here (to Lithuania) \u2014 no one had passports. They took photos, all papers, the verdict, notebooks \u2014 they took everything,\u201d Losik said.",
      "Nils Mui\u017enieks, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Belarus, described what happened to the prisoners as \u201cnot pardons, but forced exile.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese people were looking forward to returning to their homes and families,\" he said in a statement. \"Instead, they were expelled from the country, left without means of subsistence and, in some cases, stripped of identity documents.\u201d",

      "\u201cPeople went through real hell, and now we are working together to help them and facilitate their legalization and settlement, engaging all contacts with both American and European allies,\" she said.",
      "Bialiatski, Labkovich and five other members of Viasna, Belarus' oldest and most prominent rights group, were arrested in Lukashenko's crackdown on mass protests after a 2020 election that kept him in power and was denounced as rigged by the opposition and the West. Tens of thousands were arrested, with many brutally beaten, while hundreds of thousands fled abroad.",
      "Along with Bialiatski, Labkovich was accused of \u201cfinancing public unrest\u201d and helping those affected by the crackdown. Bialiatski was sentenced to 10 years in prison; Labkovich got seven.",
      "Prison authorities tried to coerce Labkovich to cooperate and launched two more criminal cases against him \u2014 refusing to obey orders of prison officials and high treason, which could have added another 15 years to his sentence.",
      "Labkovich said he spent more than 200 days in solitary confinement and \u201cand lost count of the nights on the concrete floor in the icy cell.\u201d",
      "Two other Viasna activists \u2014 Marfa Rabkova and Valiantsin Stefanovic \u2014 remain imprisoned. Labkovich believes they and others are still held so that authorities \u201ccan influence the behavior and statements of those released.\u201d",
      "Babaryka, 62, recalled that while in prison in 2023, he started having fainting episodes and once woke up with a broken rib, torn lung, pneumonia and 23 cuts in his scalp. He said he didn't know what had happened while he was unconscious and didn't want to elaborate on the conditions behind bars.",
      "\u201cI'll tell you the truth: Those who come out shouldn't talk about how they were and what they felt, because many people remain inside the system and depending on what they say, they will generally get disadvantages rather than advantages,\u201d Babaryka said Sunday in Chernihiv, Ukraine.",
      "His 35-year-old son, Eduard Babaryka, is among more than 1,100 political prisoners still held in Belarus, serving a 10-year sentence on charges of organizing mass unrest.",
      "While prisoner releases have become more regular recently, Lukashenko's crackdown continues, targeting critics wherever they live. Belarusians living abroad cannot renew their passports or get new ones at embassies and consulates, making life difficult for thousands who fled the repression.",
      "Opposition activists, rights advocates and journalists in exile face criminal trials in absentia. Authorities seize their apartments and other property, with courts rejecting attempts to contest those moves.",
      "Activists say there is a \u201crevolving door\u201d of prisoner releases and arrests. Since the Dec. 13 release, Viasna declared seven more people to be political prisoners, and 176 since September.",
      "Despite this month's pardons, Amnesty International's director for Eastern Europe Marie Struthers urged people not to forget those whose freedom \"is long overdue.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf this release is a part of political bargain, it only underscores the Belarusian authorities\u2019 cynical treatment of people as pawns,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier this week, activist Aliaksandr Zdaravennau, 46, of the southern city of Rechytsa, was convicted of high treason and participating in extremist activities and sentenced to 10 years. Subway engineer Yury Karnitski, 44, and shop clerk Alena Hartanovich, 52, were added to the Interior Ministry's list of extremists.",
      "\u201cWhile the prisoner releases are certainly a relief, there are no signs from Belarusian authorities of a change in the policy or practice of repression,\" Mui\u017enieks said. \u201cBelarus continues to rank among the countries with the highest number of political prisoners per capita.\u201d",

      "Nepal is just one of at least 150 countries to which Chinese companies are supplying surveillance technology, from cameras in Vietnam to censorship firewalls in Pakistan to citywide monitoring systems in Kenya",
      "KATHMANDU, Nepal -- The white dome of Boudhanath rises like a silent guardian over the chaotic sprawl of Nepal\u2019s capital, Kathmandu, crowned by a golden spire that pierces the sky. Painted on each of the spire\u2019s four sides are the benevolent eyes of the Buddha \u2014 wide, calm, and unblinking \u2014 said to see all that unfolds below.",
      "Those eyes have served as a symbol of sanctuary for generations of Tibetans fleeing the Chinese crackdown in their homeland. But today, Tibetan refugees are also watched by far more malevolent eyes: Thousands of CCTV cameras from China, perched on street corners and rooftops to monitor every movement below. This intense surveillance has stifled the once-vibrant Free Tibet movement that had resonated around the world.",
      "Nepal is just one of at least 150 countries to which Chinese companies are supplying surveillance technology, from cameras in Vietnam to censorship firewalls in Pakistan to citywide monitoring systems in Kenya. This technology is now a key part of China\u2019s push for global influence, as it provides cash-strapped governments cost-effective, if invasive, forms of policing \u2014 turning algorithms and data into a force multiplier for control.",
      "The irony at the heart of this digital authoritarianism is that the surveillance tools China exports are based on technology developed in its greatest rival, the United States, despite warnings that Chinese firms would buy, copy or outright steal American designs, an investigation by The Associated Press has found.",
      "For decades, Silicon Valley firms often yielded to Beijing\u2019s demands: Give us your technology and we will give you access to our market. Although tensions fester between Washington and Beijing, the links between American tech and Chinese surveillance continue today.",
      "For example, Amazon Web Services offers cloud services to Chinese tech giants like Hikvision and Dahua, assisting them in their overseas push. Both are on the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s Entity List for national security and human-rights concerns, which means transactions with them are not illegal but subject to strict restrictions.",
      "AWS told AP it adheres to ethical codes of conduct, complies with U.S. law, and does not itself offer surveillance infrastructure. Dahua said they conduct due diligence to prevent abuse of their products. Hikvision said the same, and that they \u201ccategorically reject any suggestion that the company is involved in or complicit in repression.\u201d",
      "Chinese technology firms now offer a complete suite of telecommunications, surveillance, and digital infrastructure, with few restrictions on who they sell to or how they\u2019re used.",
      "China pitches itself as a global security model with low crime rates, contrasting its record with the United States, said Sheena Greitens, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got a set of solutions that it\u2019s happy to share with the world that nobody else can offer,\u201d she said. \u201c(But) they\u2019re certainly exporting the tools and techniques that are very important to authoritarian rule.\u201d",
      "The AP investigation was based on thousands of Nepali government procurement documents, corporate marketing material, leaked government and corporate documents, and interviews with more than 40 people, including Tibetan refugees and Nepali, American and Chinese engineers, executives, experts and officials.",
      "While thousands of Tibetans once fled to Nepal every year, the number is now down to the single digits, according to Tibetan officials in Nepal. In a statement to AP, the Tibetan government in exile cited tight border controls, Nepal\u2019s warming ties with China and \u201cunprecedented surveillance\u201d as reasons for the drastic plunge.",
      "A 2021 internal Nepali government report, obtained by AP, revealed that China has even built surveillance systems within Nepal and in some areas of the border buffer zone where construction is banned by bilateral agreements. In a statement to AP, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied coercing Western companies to hand over technology or working with Nepal to surveil Tibetans, calling it a \u201csheer fabrication driven by ulterior motives.\u201d",
      "\u201cAttempts to use Tibet-related issues to interfere in China\u2019s internal affairs, smear China\u2019s image, and poison the atmosphere of China-Nepal cooperation will never succeed,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The Nepali government and the Chinese-controlled Tibetan authorities did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Under pressure, many Tibetans are responding the only way they can: Leaving. The Tibetan population in Nepal has plunged from over 20,000 to half of that or less today.",
      "Now 49, one-time protester Sonam Tashi is just a father trying to get his 10-year-old son out \u2014 before the net pulls tighter. The boy was born in Nepal but has no document proving he is either a refugee or a citizen, a result of Chinese pressure.",
      "Tashi described how those considered likely to protest are picked up in advance around key dates \u2014 like March 10, which marks the 1959 Tibetan uprising, or July 6, the Dalai Lama\u2019s birthday. In 2018, Nepal confirmed that it was building predictive policing, which allows officers to watch people\u2019s movements, identify in advance who they think will protest and arrest them preemptively.",
      "\u201cThere are cameras everywhere,\u201d Tashi said on a winding bus ride toward the Indian border. \u201cThere is no future.\u201d",
      "After China crushed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, thousands fled across the Himalayas to Nepal, carrying only what they could: Religious paintings, prayer wheels and the weight of families left behind.",
      "Their exodus, led by the charismatic Dalai Lama, captured the American imagination, with Hollywood films and actor Richard Gere\u2019s congressional appeals putting Tibet in the spotlight. Washington trod a careful line, defending the rights and religious freedom of Tibetans without recognizing independence.",
      "Today, the future of the Free Tibet movement is in question. Without refugee cards that grant basic rights, Tibetans in Nepal can no longer open bank accounts, work legally or leave the country.",
      "Nearly all police cameras monitoring Kathmandu link back to a four-story brick building just a few blocks down from the Chinese embassy, where officers watch the country in real time.",
      "The building hums with the low breath of cooling fans. Inside, a wall of monitors blinks with feeds from border towns, busy markets and clogged traffic crossings.",
      "Officers in crisp blue uniforms and red caps sit in the glow, scanning scenes. Beneath the screens, a photo published in a Nepali daily shows, a sign in English and Chinese reads: \u201cWith the compliments of the Ministry of Public Security of China.\u201d",
      "Operators can track a motorbike weaving through the capital, follow a protest as it forms, or patch an alert directly to patrol radios. Many cameras are equipped with night vision facial recognition and AI tracking \u2014 able to pick a single face out of a festival crowd or lock onto a figure until it disappears indoors. The system not only sees but is learning to remember, storing patterns of movement, building a record of lives lived under its gaze.",
      "A 34-year-old Tibetan cafe owner in the city watched the city change in quiet horror. \u201cNow you can only be Tibetan in private,\u201d he said. He and other Tibetans in Nepal spoke to AP anonymously, fearing retaliation.",
      "The first cameras in Boudhanath were installed in 2012, officially to deter crime. But after a Tibetan monk doused himself in petrol and set himself ablaze in front of the stupa in 2013, police added 35 night vision cameras around it.",
      "The Chinese embassy in Kathmandu worked closely with the police, said Rupak Shrestha, a professor at Simon Fraser University in Canada who studied surveillance in Nepal. He said the police received special training to use the new cameras, identify potential symbols associated with the Free Tibet movement and anticipate dissent.",
      "In 2013, a team of Nepal Police officers crossed the northern border into Tibet for a seemingly straightforward mission: Collect police radios from Chinese authorities in Zhangmu, a remote border town, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) from Kathmandu. A truck was loaded with equipment and a few handshakes later, they were driving back to Kathmandu.",
      "The radios \u2014 made by the partly state-owned Chinese firm Hytera \u2014 looked like walkie-talkies but ran on a digital trunking system, a scaled-down mobile network for police use. Officers could talk privately, coordinate across districts, even patch into public phone lines. The entire system \u2014 radios, relay towers, software \u2014 was a $5.5 million gift from China.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give us the money,\u201d recalled a retired Nepali officer who made the trip. \u201cThey gave all the hardware. All Chinese.\u201d",
      "He remembered not the border guards but the tech \u2014 sleek, reliable, and far ahead of anything they\u2019d used before. He spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal discussions.",
      "He said Nepal had initially considered buying the technology from the U.S. and only wanted to deploy the system in its two biggest cities. Hytera was a fraction of the cost and performed comparably, but China also wanted coverage near the border with Tibet. Nepal acquiesced.",
      "They installed the technology in Sindhupalchowk, a border district with a key road to China used by Tibetan refugees. \u201cWe understood their mindset,\u201d the retired officer said. \u201cA secure border.\u201d",
      "A police envoy from the Chinese embassy began making regular visits to the Nepal Police headquarters. He\u2019d chat over coffee, flip through brochures from Chinese companies. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018You want anything?\u2019\u201d the retired officer recalled.",
      "China began donating tens of millions in police aid and surveillance equipment, including a new school for Nepal\u2019s Armed Police Force. Hundreds of Nepali police traveled to China for training on policing and border control, according to Chinese government posts.",
      "Ahead of a summit of South Asian leaders in 2014, among the goods on offer were ones from Uniview, China\u2019s pitch for an all-seeing eye.",
      "The company was the Chinese surveillance business of what was then Hewlett Packard, or HP, before it was spun off in a 2011 deal. Since 2012, Uniview has been selling mass surveillance solutions to the Tibetan police, such as a command center, and developed cameras that track ethnicities such as Uyghurs and Tibetans.",

      "Little by little, Chinese companies chipped away at the lead of American tech companies by luring talent, obtaining research, and sometimes plain copying their hardware and software. The flow of technology continued, even as U.S. officials openly accused China of economic espionage and pressuring American companies for their technology.",

After accusing him \u2014 wrongly, he maintains \u2014 of helping Tibetans flee into Nepal, the police seized his phone, which had photos of the Dalai Lama and Tibetan music. Then came months in a Lhasa prison, where isolation and inadequate medical care hollowed him out.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cblockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers off Venezuela\u2019s coast is raising new questions about the legality of his military campaign in Latin America, while fueling concerns that the U.S. could be edging closer to war.",
      "The Trump administration says its blockade is narrowly tailored and not targeting civilians, which would be an illegal act of war. But some experts say seizing sanctioned oil tied to leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro could provoke a military response from Venezuela, engaging American forces in a new level of conflict that goes beyond their attacks on alleged drug boats.",
      "\u201cMy biggest fear is this is exactly how wars start and how conflicts escalate out of control,\u201d said Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. \u201cAnd there are no adults in the room with this administration, nor is there consultation with Congress. So I\u2019m very worried.\u201d",
      "Claire Finkelstein, a professor of national security law at the University of Pennsylvania, said the use of such an aggressive tactic without congressional authority stretches the bounds of international law and increasingly looks like a veiled attempt to trigger a Venezuelan response.",
      "\u201cThe concern is that we are bootstrapping our way into armed conflict,\u201d Finkelstein said. \u201cWe\u2019re upping the ante in order to try to get them to engage in an act of aggression that would then justify an act of self-defense on our part.\u201d",
      "Trump has used the word \u201cblockade\u201d to describe his latest tactic in an escalating pressure campaign against Maduro, who has been charged with narcoterrorism in the U.S. and now has been accused of using oil profits to fund drug trafficking. While Trump said it only applies to vessels facing U.S. economic penalties, the move has sparked outrage among Democrats and mostly shrugs, if not cheers, from Republicans.",
      "Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, said Trump going after sanctioned oil tankers linked to Venezuela is no different from targeting Iranian oil.",
      "\u201cJust like with the Iranian shadow tankers, I have no problem with that,\u201d McCaul said. \u201cThey\u2019re circumventing sanctions.\u201d",
      "The president has declared the U.S. is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels in an effort to reduce the flow of drugs to American communities.

      "Besides padding Musk's current fortune of $679 billion, the restoration of the 2018 pay package vindicates his long-held belief that the Delaware legal system had overstepped its bounds in January 2024 when Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick rescinded the compensation in a case brought by a disgruntled Tesla shareholder.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday.",
      "McCormick's ruling so incensed Musk that it spurred him to spurn Delaware and reincorporate Tesla in Texas. That decision also caused Tesla's board to scramble for ways to keep its CEO happy, including a successful effort to persuade the company's shareholders to reaffirm the pay package, which was valued at $44.9 billion at the time of the second vote 18 months ago.",
      "With Musk still signaling discontent, Tesla upped the ante again this year by crafting another pay package that could pay him $1 trillion if he can lead the automaker down a road during the next decade that lifts the company's market value from its current $1.6 trillion to $8.5 trillion. Shareholders approved that pay package last month, to Musk's delight.",
      "That may sound like a difficult task, but it also appeared like a long shot for Musk to hit all the targets to qualify for the payout that was dangled in the 2018 package. At that time, Tesla was still struggling to expand its production of electric vehicles and burning through cash.",

Jim Hunt, a towering figure in North Carolina politics in the late 20th century who helped leaders from both major parties strive for public education reform, died Thursday at the age of 88, his daughter Lt.

      "Considered a business-oriented progressive, Hunt was a giant in state government and influential in the national education reform movement of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. He was first elected governor in 1976 and, after a constitutional change, became the first North Carolina governor elected to successive four-year terms.",
      "Following an epic U.S. Senate campaign loss to Republican icon Jesse Helms in 1984, Hunt's political career resumed eight years later with a third term at the Executive Mansion, followed by reelection in 1996.",
      "Hunt remained active in Democratic politics after leaving office in 2001, particularly as he watched prot\u00e9g\u00e9s such as former Gov. Roy Cooper and the late U.S. Sen. Kay Hagan achieve higher office. He campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Rodham Clinton and Cooper in 2016.",
      "\u201cI can think of no one who shaped North Carolina\u2019s recent successes as much as Governor Jim Hunt,\" current Democratic Gov. Josh Stein said Thursday. And Cooper called Hunt the \u201cgreatest Governor in North Carolina history.\u201d",
      "Even entering his 80s, Hunt urged Republicans in charge of the legislature to fund \u201cbig things\u201d for public education, rather than pass more income tax cuts.",
      "\u201cI'm proud of what we've done together,\u201d Hunt said in a May 2017 interview. \u201cBut I'm far from satisfied about where we are and determined to keep doing my little bit, I guess, to help us keep changing things and improving things in North Carolina. And I know you do it mainly through education.\u201d",
      "Hunt concentrated relentlessly on public schools, talking about the connection between education achievement and competing in the world economy. In the 1970s, while lieutenant governor, he worked with Republican Gov. Jim Holshouser to make North Carolina the first state with full-day kindergarten.",
      "In the 1980s, he helped create the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and pressed for standardized testing for public school students nationwide so that states could compare themselves.",
      "Returning as governor in the 1990s, he championed the Smart Start early childhood initiative, viewed as a national model to prepare children for school, and higher teacher pay. And after the end of his career in office, The Hunt Institute began training up and coming political stars nationwide about public education policy.",

      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- To tax tips or not? That is a question that will confront lawmakers in states across the U.S. as they convene for work next year.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is urging states to follow its lead by enacting a slew of new tax breaks for individuals and businesses, including deductions for tips and overtime wages, automobile loans and business equipment.",
      "In some states, the new federal tax breaks will automatically apply to state income taxes unless legislatures opt out. But in many other states, where tax laws are written differently, the new tax breaks won't appear on state tax forms unless legislatures opt in.",
      "In states that don't conform to the federal tax changes, workers who receive tips or overtime \u2014 for example \u2014 will pay no federal tax on those earnings but could still owe state taxes on them.",
      "States that embrace all of Trump's tax cuts could provide hundreds of millions of dollars of annual savings to certain residents and businesses. But that could financially strain states, which are being hit with higher costs because of new Medicaid and SNAP food aid requirements that also are included in the big bill Trump signed.",
      "Most states begin their annual legislative sessions in January. To retroactively change tax breaks for 2025, lawmakers would need to act quickly so tax forms could updated before people begin filing them. States also could apply the changes to their 2026 taxes, a decision requiring less haste.",
      "So far, only a few states have taken votes on whether to adopt the tax breaks.",
      "\u201cStates in general are approaching this skeptically,\" said Carl Davis, research director at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.",
      "A bill Trump signed on July 4 contains about $4.5 trillion of federal tax cuts over 10 years.",
      "It creates temporary tax deductions for tips, overtime and loan interest on new vehicles assembled in the U.S. It boosts a tax deduction for older adults. And it temporarily raises cap on state and local tax deductions from $10,000 to $40,000, among other things. The law also provides numerous tax breaks to businesses, including the ability to immediately write off 100% of the cost of equipment and research.",
      "Forty-one states levy individual income taxes on wages and salaries. Forty-four states charge corporate income taxes.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this month called on those states \u201cto immediately conform\u201d to the federal tax cuts and accused some Democratic-led states that haven't done so of engaging in \"political obstructionism.\u201d Though Bessent didn't mention it, many Republican-led states also have not decided whether to implement the tax deductions.",
      "\u201cBy denying their residents access to these important tax cuts, these governors and legislators are forcing hardworking Americans to shoulder higher state tax burdens, robbing them of the relief they deserve and exacerbating the financial squeeze on low- and middle-income households,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "But some tax analysts contend there's more for states to consider. The tax break on tips, for example, could apply to nearly 70 occupation fields under a proposed rule from the Internal Revenue Service. But that would still exclude numerous low-wage workers, said Jared Walczak, vice president of state projects at the nonprofit Tax Foundation.",

But Colorado opted out of the state tax break for overtime shortly before the federal law was enacted.",
      "Michigan this fall became first \u2014 and, so far, only \u2014 state to opt into the tax breaks for tips and overtime wages, effective in 2026. The overtime tax exemption is projected to cost the state nearly $113 million and the tips tax break about $45 million during its current budget year, according to the state treasury department.",

Katie Hobbs has called upon lawmakers to adopt the tax breaks for tips, overtime, seniors and vehicle loans, and follow the federal government by also increasing the state's standard deduction for individual income taxpayers. Republican state House leaders said they stand ready to pass the tax cuts when their session begins Jan. 12.",

      "\u201cThe decoupling is an effort to try to hold back the onslaught from the federal government to make sure that we can support programs like the one we\u2019re announcing today,\u201d Pritzker told reporters at a December event publicizing a grant to address homelessness in central Illinois.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage edged lower this week, staying relatively close to its low for the year.",
      "The decline brings the average long-term mortgage rate to 6.21% from 6.22% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.72%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell this week. The rate averaged 5.47%, down from 5.54% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.92%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.12% at midday Thursday, unchanged from a week ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has been mostly holding steady in recent weeks since it dropped to 6.17%, its lowest level in more than a year, on Oct. 30.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month. An encouraging report on inflation on Thursday could give the central bank cause to keep cutting interest rates next year.",
      "The Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates. That\u2019s what happened in the fall of 2024 after the central bank cut its main rate for the first time in more than four years. Instead of falling, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually cresting above 7% in January this year. At that time, the 10-year Treasury yield was climbing toward 5%.",

      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for many aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don\u2019t have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market are also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Homeowners eager to refinance their home loan to a lower rate have benefited from easing mortgage rates.",
      "Applications for mortgage refinance loans made up 59% of all home loan applications last week, the highest level since September, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",

      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump announced Friday that nine drugmakers have agreed to lower the cost of their prescription drugs in the U.S.",
      "Pharmaceutical companies Amgen, Bristol Myers Squibb, Boehringer Ingelheim, Genentech, Gilead Sciences, GSK, Merck, Novartis and Sanofi will now rein in Medicaid drug prices to match what they charged in other developed countries.",
      "As part of the deal, new drugs made by those companies will also be charged at the so-called \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d pricing across the country on any newly launched medications for all, including commercial and cash pay markets as well as Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "Drug prices for patients in the U.S. can depend on a number of factors, including the competition a treatment faces and insurance coverage. Most people have coverage through work, the individual insurance market or government programs like Medicaid and Medicare, which shield them from much of the cost.",
      "Patients in Medicaid, the state and federally funded program for people with low incomes, already pay a nominal co-payment of a few dollars to fill their prescriptions, but lower prices could help state budgets that fund the programs.",
      "Lower drug prices also will help patients who have no insurance coverage and little leverage to negotiate better deals on what they pay. But even steep discounts of 50% found through the administration\u2019s website could still leave patients paying hundreds of dollars a month for some prescriptions.",
      "William Padula, a pharmaceutical and health economics professor at USC, said Medicaid already has the most favorable drug rates which in some cases will be close to what the \u201cmost-favored-nation\u201d price is so it remains to be seen what other impacts it could have, such as more research and development.",
      "\u201cIt can\u2019t be bad. I don\u2019t see much downside but it\u2019s hard to judge what the upside is,\u201d Padula said.",
      "And while it is significant that Trump was able to get big drugmakers to the table to negotiate lower prices, it will take years to gage how effective this initiative is in terms of more people obtaining more of the medicines they need.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for their stock and it\u2019s good for their future\u201d research and development, Padula said of the pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly influential but will all this add up to a major effect? Nothing really matters here unless our health gets better as a country.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the drugmakers will also sell pharmacy-ready medicines on the TrumpRx platform, which is set to launch in January and will allow people to buy drugs directly from manufacturers.",

      "The New Jersey-based Bristol Myers Squibb further announced that it will be giving for free to the Medicaid program its signature blood thinner prescribed to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Known as Eliquis, it is the company\u2019s top prescribed drug as well as being one of Medicaid\u2019s most widely-used medicines.",
      "Padula said the donations \u2014 which encompass some of the world\u2019s most critical medicines \u2014 are a significant step toward health equity and an acknowledgement that the drugmakers can afford to seek profits elsewhere in their operations. Eliquis already has been one of the most profitable drugs ever made.",

      "Other major drugmakers including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly struck similar deals with the Trump administration earlier this year.",
      "Though individual terms were not disclosed, the administration has now negotiated lower drug prices with 14 companies since Trump publicly sent letters to executives at 17 pharmaceutical companies about the issue, noting that U.S. prices for brand-name drugs can be up to three times higher than averages elsewhere.",

      "But in skilled trades, the problem is even more acute. Consulting firm McKinsey analyzed 12 types of trade job categories, including maintenance technicians, welders, and carpenters, and predicted an estimated imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee from 2022 to 2032.",
      "McKinsey noted \u201cthe extraordinary rate of churn\u201d could cost companies more than $5.3 billion every year in talent acquisition and training costs alone.",

      "It must be a case of the best of the worst",
      "Apparently, the worst Australian cricket team in 15 years just won the Ashes with two matches to spare against the best England squad assembled since 2011.",
      "Long-time protagonist Stuart Broad lit the fuse ahead of a volatile contest for the longest-running rivalry in test cricket when he described the host squad as the worst to contest the Ashes in Australia since England won the 2010-11 series Down Under.",
      "The 167-test veteran played two matches for England in that winning series.",
      "Since then, a drought has extended to 16 losses, two draws and no wins for England on Australian soil.",
      "Marnus Labuschagne, who produced a spectacular catch to help hasten the end of England's dogged last-day comeback in the third test on Sunday, reflected on the pre-series pronouncements by Broad and others.",
      "\u201cHave to say, being called the worst Australian team in 15 years\u2026 like it's nice to be sitting where we are, 3-0 up,\u201d he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cThe job's not done yet. We want to make sure it's 5-0 and really take that urn.\u201d",
      "It took all of 11 days \u2014 two in Perth, four in Brisbane and almost a full five in Adelaide \u2014 not quite a record for clinching an Ashes series but not too far off.",
      "Chasing what needed to be a world record for victory, England was all out for 352 in pursuit of 435, giving Australia an 82-run win. By going the distance, the third test drew a total crowd of 223,638.",
      "The Barmy Army of traveling England supporters was in full voice as England took the record-chasing fourth innings into the penultimate session at the Adelaide Oval, but ultimately it was the Aussies crowing about yet another dramatic win.",
      "It's true, Australia had a patched-up squad, with skipper Pat Cummins missing the first two tests while he continued recovery from a back injury. Josh Hazlewood was ruled out for the series. That left Mitchell Starc as the only member of the regular pace triumvirate available for the first two tests. When offspinner Nathan Lyon was dropped for the second test, Starc was the only member of Australia's longtime bowling quartet in the lineup.",
      "He led from the front, with two man-of-the-match performances. With three of the last four wickets in Adelaide, he has 22 for the series and 51 for the calendar year.",

      "In the batting lineup, there were questions over who would open and who would bat at No. 3. Steve Smith led the team in the absence of Cummins in Perth and Brisbane but was ruled out of the third test because of vertigo. Usman Khawaja was rushed back into the lineup to replace him and helped hold things together in the first innings.",
      "Cummins said the Australian players took the attitude of just playing what's in front of them.",
      "\u201cYou just kind of crack on,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I missed the first couple of games, Steve stepped right in. It was smooth, seamless.",
      "\u201cAnd there\u2019s always things that crop up \u2026 but the boys go, \u2018OK, that\u2019s happened, let\u2019s crack on, what\u2019s next?\u2019 That\u2019s one of the big reasons why we\u2019ve had success over the last couple of years.\u201d",
      "That attitude will really be tested again in Melbourne starting Boxing Day, with Cummins and Lyon unlikely to play the fourth test.",
      "Khawaja's back injury in the first test forced Travis Head up from No. 5 to open the innings, and he responded with a match-winning century in that game. He made the opening slot his own, posting 170 on his home ground in Adelaide in the second innings.",
      "In a post-match TV interview Head was asked what it's like to be part of the Australian team. His answer was simple: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s bloody amazing.\u201d",

      "Or, maybe it was coach Bob Chesney calling for a wide receiver pass on the Dukes\u2019 second series of the evening. Even 12th-ranked James Madison successfully pulling off a fake punt could have adequately explained what the scoreboard failed to convey.",
      "It was clear that the fifth-ranked Oregon Ducks were in a different class than their visitors in a 51-34 win in a College Football Playoff first round matchup Saturday at Autzen Stadium. Oregon led 48-13 midway through the third quarter before the Dukes added three late touchdowns to make the final score appear closer than the game really was.",
      "\u201cI think the scoreboard itself, every time we got down there we kind of shot ourselves in the foot,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cIf we did not do that, if we did not end with 13 penalties, is this a little bit of a different game? Maybe. But at the same point in time, that\u2019s a tough offense to stop, and I think it\u2019s tough for a lot of teams in the entire country to stop.\"",
      "With James Madison\u2019s loss, Group of Five teams fell to 0-4 all-time in CFP games. No. 17 Tulane fell 41-10 to No. 6 Mississippi on Saturday, too, while Penn State beat Boise State 31-14 in last year\u2019s Fiesta Bowl. Alabama topped Cincinnati 27-6 in a 2022 CFP semifinal at the Cotton Bowl.",
      "Following their loss to Ole Miss, Green Wave head coach Jon Sumrall brushed aside any notion of his team not belonging among the last 12 standing.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re our conference champion and the rules are what they were, and I think there should be access for at least one G5 team moving forward,\u201d Sumrall said. \u201cI do. I think you should have given the American champion an opportunity before the ACC champion this year because we beat the ACC champion. So Duke won the ACC Championship; we beat them.\u201d",
      "To Sumrall\u2019s point, Tulane beat a pair of Power Four teams in Northwestern and Duke, but those schools combined to go 14-11 in 2025.",
      "James Madison, meanwhile, lost to its only Power Four opponent this season, with Louisville beating it 28-14 in a game in which the Dukes mustered just 263 yards of total offense. Most of the season, James Madison ran with the ball with ease against its opponents, rushing for over 300 yards in a game five times and over 200 yards in a game nine times.",
      "But on Saturday, the Dukes mostly abandoned the run after quickly falling behind, and instead often turned to Sun Belt Player of the Year and quarterback Alonza Barnett III, who attempted a career-high 48 passes in the contest. Even so, Barnett was confident his team belonged in the CFP over other Power Four schools.",
      "\u201cI believe people saw that we were meant to be on this level. When you look at the Power Four teams and whatever, the destiny is really \u2014 the ball is in your court. You control your own destiny,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cMost of those teams that didn\u2019t make it, they controlled their own destiny, and we handled what we could handle and we didn\u2019t give into outside noise.\"",

      "But where the Dukes fell flat was slowing down the Ducks\u2019 ninth-ranked scoring offense. Oregon ran the ball with ease, averaging more than 7.7 yards per attempt against James Madison\u2019s run defense that entered the contest allowing the second-fewest yards per game in the country.",
      "As has often been the case in matchups between Power Four and Group of Five teams, the greatest discrepancies existed in the trenches. To a man, James Madison could not adequately match up with Oregon, just as Tulane couldn\u2019t with Ole Miss and many other Group of Five programs before them both failed to do.",

      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways",
      "Every animal with a brain needs sleep \u2014 and even a few without a brain do, too. Humans sleep, birds sleep, whales sleep and even jellyfish sleep.",
      "Sleep is universal \u201ceven though it\u2019s actually very risky,\u201d said Paul-Antoine Libourel, a researcher at the Neuroscience Research Center of Lyon in France.",
      "When animals nod off, they're most vulnerable to sneaky predators. But despite the risks, the need for sleep is so strong that no creature can skip it altogether, even when it's highly inconvenient.",
      "Animals that navigate extreme conditions and environments have evolved to sleep in extreme ways \u2014 for example, stealing seconds at a time during around-the-clock parenting, getting winks on the wing during long migrations and even dozing while swimming.",
      "For a long time, scientists could only make educated guesses about when wild animals were sleeping, observing when they lay still and closed their eyes. But in recent years, tiny trackers and helmets that measure brain waves \u2014 miniaturized versions of equipment in human sleep labs \u2014 have allowed researchers to glimpse for the first time the varied and sometimes spectacular ways that wild animals snooze.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re finding that sleep is really flexible in response to ecological demands,\u201d said Niels Rattenborg, an animal sleep research specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence in Germany.",
      "Call it the emerging science of \u201cextreme sleep.\u201d",

      "These penguins mate for life and share parenting duties \u2014 with one bird babysitting the egg or tiny gray fluffy chick to keep it warm and safe while the other swims off to fish for a family meal. Then they switch roles \u2014 keeping up this nonstop labor for weeks.",
      "Penguin parents face a common challenge: getting enough sleep while keeping a close eye on their newborns.",
      "They survive by taking thousands of catnaps a day \u2014 each averaging just 4 seconds long.",
      "These short \u201cmicrosleeps,\" as Korea Polar Research Institute biologist Won Young Lee calls them, appear to be enough to allow penguin parents to carry out their caregiving duties for weeks within their crowded, noisy colonies.",
      "When a clumsy neighbor passes by or predatory seabirds are near, the penguin parent blinks to alert attention and soon dozes off again, its chin nodding against its chest, like a drowsy driver.",
      "The naps add up. Each penguin sleeps for a total of 11 hours per day, as scientists found by measuring the brain activity of 14 adults over 11 days on Antarctica's King George Island.",
      "To remain mostly alert, yet also sneak in sufficient winks, the penguins have evolved an enviable ability to function on extremely fractured sleep \u2014 at least during the breeding season.",
      "Researchers can now see when either hemisphere of the brain \u2014 or both at once \u2014 are asleep.",

      "In some cases, the answer is yes \u2014 as scientists discovered when they attached devices that measure brain-wave activity to the heads of large seabirds nesting in the Galapagos Islands called great frigatebirds.",
      "While flying, frigatebirds can sleep with one half of the brain at a time. The other half remains semialert so that one eye is still watching for obstacles in their flight path.",
      "This allows the birds to soar for weeks at a time, without touching land or water, which would damage their delicate, non-water repellent feathers.",
      "Frigatebirds can't do tricky maneuvers \u2014 flapping, foraging or diving \u2014 with just one half of their brain. When they dive for prey, they must be fully awake. But in flight, they have evolved to sleep when gliding and circling upward on massive drafts of warm rising air that keep them aloft with minimal effort.",
      "Back at the nest in trees or bushes, frigatebirds change up their nap routine \u2014 they are more likely to sleep with their whole brain at once and for much longer bouts. This suggests their in-flight sleeping is a specific adaptation for extended flying, Rattenborg said.",
      "A few other animals have similar sleeping hacks. Dolphins can sleep with one half of the brain at a time while swimming. Some other birds, including swifts and albatrosses, can sleep in flight, scientists say.",
      "Frigatebirds can fly 255 miles (410 kilometers) a day for more than 40 days, before touching land, other researchers found \u2014 a feat that wouldn\u2019t be possible without being able to sleep on the wing.",
      "On land, life is easy for a 5,000-pound (2,268-kilogram) northern elephant seal. But at sea, sleep is dangerous \u2014 sharks and killer whales that prey on seals are lurking.",
      "These seals go on extended foraging trips, for up to eight months, repeatedly diving to depths of several hundred feet (meters) to catch fish, squid, rays and other sea snacks.",
      "Each deep dive may last around 30 minutes. And for around a third of that time, the seals may be asleep, as research led by Jessica Kendall-Bar of Scripps Institution of Oceanography revealed.",
      "Kendall-Bar's team devised a neoprene headcap similar to a swimming cap with equipment to detect motion and seal brain activity during dives, and retrieved the caps with logged data when seals returned to beaches in Northern California.",
      "The 13 female seals studied tended to sleep during the deepest portions of their dives, when they were below the depths that predators usually patrol.",
      "That sleep consisted of both slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. During REM, or rapid eye movement sleep, the seals were temporarily paralyzed \u2014 just like humans during this deep-sleep stage \u2014 and their dive motion changed. Instead of a controlled downward glide motion, they sometimes turned upside down and spun in what the researchers called a \u201csleep spiral\u201d during REM sleep.",
      "In the span of 24 hours, the seals at sea slept for around two hours total. (Back on the beach, they averaged around 10 hours.)",
      "Scientists are still learning about all the reasons we sleep \u2014 and just how much we really need.",
      "It's unlikely that any tired human can try these extreme animal sleep hacks. But learning more about how varied napping may be in the wild shows the flexibility of some species. Nature has evolved to make shut-eye possible in even the most precarious situations.",

      "NEW YORK -- The last major meteor shower of the year, known as the Ursids, peaks soon, bringing glowing streaks to nighttime and early morning skies. Compared to other meteor showers, it's more subdued, but experts say it's still worth a glimpse.",
      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "How active a shower will appear from Earth depends on the amount of debris and the moon's brightness, which can blot out glowing meteors. The Ursids feature less space debris than other showers like the Geminids, but the narrow crescent moon won't be much of an obstacle when they peak.",

      "Sunday marks the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, signaling the start of astronomical winter",
      "Yes the darkest day of the year is here, but that means brighter days are ahead.",
      "Sunday is the shortest day of the year north of the equator, where the solstice marks the start of astronomical winter. It\u2019s the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere, where it is the longest day of the year and summer will start.",
      "The word \u201csolstice\u201d comes from the Latin words \u201csol\u201d for sun and \u201cstitium\u201d which can mean \u201cpause\u201d or \u201cstop.\u201d The solstice is an end of the sun\u2019s annual march higher or lower in the sky. The winter solstice is when the sun makes its shortest, lowest arc. The good news for sun lovers: It then starts climbing again and days will get a little longer every day until late June.",
      "People have marked solstices for eons with celebrations and monuments such as Stonehenge, which was designed to align with the sun\u2019s paths at the solstices. But what is happening in the heavens? Here\u2019s what to know about the Earth\u2019s orbit.",
      "As the Earth travels around the sun, it does so at an angle, making the sun's warmth and light fall unequally on the northern and southern halves of the planet for most of the year.",
      "The solstices mark the times when the Earth's tilt toward or away from the sun is at its maximum. This means the hemispheres are getting very different amounts of sunlight \u2014 and days and nights are at their most unequal.",
      "At the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice the upper half of the Earth is at its furthest lean away from the sun \u2014 leading to the shortest day and longest night of the year. The winter solstice falls can fall between Dec. 20 and 23 \u2014 this year it's the 21st.",
      "The opposite happens at a Northern Hemisphere summer solstice: The upper half of the Earth is leaning toward the sun, creating the longest day and shortest night of the year. This solstice falls between June 20 and 22.",
      "During the equinox, the Earth\u2019s axis and its orbit align so that both hemispheres get an equal amount of sunlight.",

      "Isaacman, who has promised to bring a business-minded approach to the space agency, was confirmed in a bipartisan vote, 67-30.",

      "Titan instead may hold deep layers of ice and slush more akin to Earth\u2019s polar seas, with pockets of melted water where life could possibly survive and even thrive, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "The team led by researchers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory challenged the decade-long assumption of a buried global ocean at Titan after taking a fresh look at observations made years ago by NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft around Saturn.",
      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Fernando Moreno has been on dialysis for about two years, enduring an \u201cunbearable\u201d wait for a new kidney to save his life. His limited world of social contacts has meant that his hopes have hinged on inching up the national waiting list for a transplant.",
      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21.

      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "\u201cWhat do we sell in the Dominican Republic? Beaches,\u201d del Rosario said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have corals, we lose coastal protection, we lose the sand on our beaches, and we lose tourism.\u201d",
      "Corals also are home to more than 25% of marine life, making them crucial for the millions of people around the world who make a living from fishing.",
      "Alido Luis B\u00e1ez knows this well.",
      "It's not yet dawn in Bayahibe when he climbs into a boat to fish with his father, who at 65 still goes to sea every week. The engine roars as they travel mile after mile until the coastline fades into the horizon. To catch tuna, dorado, or marlin, Luis B\u00e1ez sails up to 50 miles offshore.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to go so far before,\u201d he said. \u201cBut because of overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change, now you have to go a little further every day.\u201d",
      "Things were very different when his father, also named Alido Luis, started fishing in the 1970s. Back then, they went out in a sailboat, and the coral reefs were so healthy they found plenty of fish close to the coast.",
      "\"I used to be a diver, and I caught a lot of lobster and queen conch,\u201d he said in a voice weakened by the passage of time. \u201cIn a short time, I would catch 50 or 60 pounds of fish. But now, to catch two or three fish, they spend the whole day out there.\u201d",
      "Del Rosario said there's still time to halt the decline of the reefs.",
      "\u201cMore needs to be done, of course ... but we are investing a lot of effort and time to preserve what we love so much,\" he said. \"And we trust and believe that many people around the world are doing the same.\u201d",

      "A congressional report says China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications",
      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

      "Rep. John Moolenaar, a Michigan Republican who chairs the select committee, said in a statement that the \u201cinvestigation reveals a deeply alarming problem: The Department of Energy failed to ensure the security of its research and it put American taxpayers on the hook for funding the military rise of our nation\u2019s foremost adversary.\u201d",
      "Moolenaar this year introduced legislation aimed at preventing research funding in science and technology and defense from going to collaborations or partnerships with \u201cforeign adversary-controlled\u201d entities that pose a national security risk.",

It was met with strong opposition from scientists and researchers, who argued that the measures were too broad and could chill collaboration and undermine America's competitive edge in science and technology.",
      "In an October letter, a group of more than 750 faculty members and senior staffers from American universities told congressional leaders overseeing the armed services that the U.S. is in a global competition for talent.

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.",
      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",
      "The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.",
      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

Loureiro, a married 47-year-old from Portugal, was shot Monday night and died Tuesday at a local hospital.",
      "Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive, and no suspects were in custody as of Wednesday morning, the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office said.",
      "The shooting in Brookline, Massachusetts, comes days after a deadly attack at another prestigious school in the region, Brown University, where police also haven't identified the suspect who killed two students and wounded nine others. The FBI said it knows of no connection between the two crimes.",
      "Loureiro joined MIT in 2016 and was named last year to lead the school\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, one of its largest laboratories. The center has around 250 researchers working across seven buildings and focuses on advancing clean energy technology and other research.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

    "summary": "The No. 2 official in the Justice Department told ABC News that there has been \"no effort\" to redact President Donald Trump's name from the release of files.",
    "story": [
      "Deputy AG Todd Blanche says there has been no effort to redact Trump's name.",
      "The No. 2 official in the Justice Department told ABC News in an interview Friday that there has been \"no effort\" to redact President Donald Trump's name from the release of files stemming from federal investigations into convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche was asked Friday in an interview by ABC News Chief Justice Correspondent Pierre Thomas whether every document that mentions Trump will be released as the government continues its rollout of hundreds of thousands of files\u00a0in the coming weeks.",
      "\"Assuming it's consistent with the law, yes,\" Blanche said. \"So there's no effort to hold anything back because there's the name Donald J. Trump or anybody else's name,\u00a0Bill Clinton's name,\u00a0Reid Hoffman's name. There's no effort to hold back or not hold back because of that and -- and so -- but again, we're not, we're not redacting the names of famous men and women that are associated with Epstein.\"",
      "When directly pressed over whether there's been any order to DOJ\u00a0 personnel\u00a0to redact materials involving Trump, Blanche rejected any such suggestion and accused Democratic lawmakers of using selective disclosures from Epstein's estate to present Trump in a negative light.",
      "\"President Trump has certainly said from the beginning that he expects all files that can be released to be released and that's exactly what we're doing,\" Blanche said.",
      "Blanche sat for the interview just hours before the department released its first tranche of thousands of files, which contained little information related to Trump and instead included images of former President Bill Clinton without context, which were highlighted on social media by DOJ and White House officials.",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton accused the department of selectively disclosing the pictures in a statement and denied that they showed any wrongdoing by the former president.",
      "\"The White House hasn't been hiding these files for months only to dump them late on a Friday only to protect Bill Clinton,\" Clinton's spokesperson Angel Urena said Friday. \"They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton.\"",
      "\"Everyone, especially MAGA, expects answers, not scapegoats,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In the ABC News interview, Blanche further sought to defend the department's decision not to release the entirety of its files subject to disclosure\u00a0under\u00a0the bill signed into law by Trump, which gave the Justice Department a 30-day deadline to release the entirety of its Epstein investigative files.",
      "\"I did not say that all the files will not be released, I said all the files will not be released today,\" Blanche said when asked about an interview he gave earlier Friday to Fox News. \"And the law is very specific that the Department of Justice is required to make sure that we protect victims. And as recently as Wednesday, we learned of additional victim names, and so we've received over 1,200 names of victims and their family members since we started this process. And so there's an established precedent that in a situation like this, where it's in essence impossible for us to comply with the law today, that we comply with the law, consistent with the law.\"",
      "When asked whether the public should be confident that Blanche, who previously served as Trump's personal defense attorney, would act in the public's interest over Trump, Blanche said the American people should look at what the department ultimately releases.",
      "\"Your confidence should be in the fact that for decades, lots of people have been trying to go after President Trump falsely, and when it came to the Epstein saga, it's exactly the same story.\"",
      "Blanche added that the process to make redactions to the documents, \"was not Attorney General [Pam] Bondi, [FBI] Director Patel, Todd Blanche going through and coding millions of documents and saying, 'yes, no, yes, no.' You have multiple, dozens and dozens of the most highly trained lawyers in the Department of Justice working for the National Security Division. These are career lawyers engaged in this process.\"",

      "Two separate federal grand juries in the past two weeks have\u00a0rejected the department's efforts\u00a0to re-indict James on mortgage fraud charges and a separate federal judge in Washington, D.C., has restricted prosecutors from accessing key evidence in their probe of Comey.",
      "Blanche confirmed the department's investigation into Comey \"is continuing\" and said it was \"not a mystery\" that DOJ plans to still seek charges against him and rejected any suggestion the prosecution was \"vindictive.\"",
      "James and Comey have denied all wrongdoing.",
      "When asked about the interview that Wiles, the White House chief of staff, gave to Vanity Fair in which she candidly appeared to concede the DOJ's prosecution of James was \"retribution,\" Blanche again defended the department's actions.",
      "\"Because we're looking at the evidence, we're investigating them, investigating the cases. We have law enforcement, career law enforcement, doing the investigations\u00a0are being presented to a grand jury in the normal course,\" Blanche said.",
      "ABC News has previously reported that career prosecutors on both the James and Comey investigations recommended prosecutors\u00a0not pursue \u00a0either indictment based on what they considered the lack of sufficient evidence to secure a conviction.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",

      "The Department of Justice has published thousands of its files related to Jeffrey Epstein",
      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.",
      "But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.",
      "The file dump \u2014 dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions \u2014 comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government's investigations into the wealthy financier.",
      "President Donald Trump, who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn\u2019t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.",
      "On Nov. 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, he signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department\u2019s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday\u2019s release of the files shows how the administration is the \u201cmost transparent in history.\u201d",
      "Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department's initial Epstein file release:",
      "The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.",
      "Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.",
      "But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department's website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.",
      "Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files \u2014 mostly photographs \u2014 under a subset the Justice Department described as \u201cDOJ Disclosures.\" The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein\u2019s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted and anything containing a victim\u2019s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn\u2019t authorized for release.",
      "Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.",
      "Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president. Clinton has acknowledged that he traveled on Epstein's private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier's crimes.",
      "Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.",
      "Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson, singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.",
      "And another shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face is redacted. The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.",

      "Angel Ure\u00f1a, Clinton\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said in an X post that \u201cthis isn\u2019t about Bill Clinton\u201d and accused the White House of trying to protect others.",
      "\u201cThere are two types of people here,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We\u2019re in the first.\u201d",
      "Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone\u2019s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.",
      "To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely \u2014 or not at all.",
      "For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.",
      "The release does include at least one photo of the former Prince Andrew, who appears in a tuxedo lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. One of Epstein\u2019s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with men, including the prince.",
      "Marina Lacerda, one of the women who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein, beginning when she was 14 years old, said Friday she wanted to see greater transparency from the Justice Department and expressed frustration over redactions and the incomplete release.",
      "\u201cJust put out the files,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd stop redacting names that don\u2019t need to be redacted.\u201d",
      "Several lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for failing to produce all the documents required under the law.",
      "Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticize the partial release.",
      "Massie wrote that it \u201cgrossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\u201d Khanna called the release so far \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're going to push for the actual documents,\u201d he said.",
      "Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein's victims. He added he was \u201cexploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people.\u201d",
      "If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.",
      "Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.",

      "NEW YORK -- Luigi Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend that Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s decision to seek the death penalty against him in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was tainted by her prior work as a lobbyist at a firm that represented the insurer\u2019s parent company.",
      "Bondi was a partner at Ballard Partners before leading the Justice Department\u2019s charge to turn Mangione\u2019s federal prosecution into a capital case, creating a \u201cprofound conflict of interest\u201d that violated his due process rights, his lawyers wrote in a court filing late Friday. They want prosecutors barred from seeking the death penalty and some charges thrown out. A hearing is scheduled for Jan. 9.",
      "By involving herself in the death penalty decision and making public statements suggesting that Mangione deserves execution, Bondi broke a vow she made before taking office in February that she would follow ethical regulations and bow out of matters pertaining to Ballard clients for a year, Mangione\u2019s lawyers said.",
      "They argued Bondi has continued to profit from her work for Ballard \u2014 and, indirectly, from its work for UnitedHealth Group \u2014 through a profit-sharing arrangement with the lobbying firm and a defined contribution plan it administers.",
      "The \u201cvery person\u201d empowered to seek Mangione\u2019s death \"has a financial stake in the case she is prosecuting,\u201d his lawyers wrote. Her conflict of interest \u201cshould have caused her to recuse herself from making any decisions on this case,\u201d they added.",
      "Messages seeking comment were left for the Justice Department and Ballard Partners.",
      "Bondi announced in April that she was directing Manhattan federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty, declaring even before Mangione was formally indicted that capital punishment was warranted for a \u201cpremeditated, cold-blooded assassination that shocked America.\u201d",
      "Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4, 2024, as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",
      "Mangione, 27, the Ivy League-educated scion of a wealthy Maryland family, was arrested five days later at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to federal and state murder charges. The state charges carry the possibility of life in prison. Neither trial has been scheduled.",
      "Friday\u2019s filing put the focus back on Mangione\u2019s federal case a day after a marathon pretrial hearing ended in his fight to bar prosecutors in his state case from using certain evidence found during his arrest, such as a gun that police said matched the one used to kill Thompson and a notebook in which he purportedly described his intent to \u201cwack\u201d a health insurance executive. A ruling isn't expected until May.",
      "Mangione\u2019s defense team, led by the husband-and-wife duo of Karen Friedman-Agnifilo and Marc Agnifilo, zeroed in on Bondi\u2019s past lobbying work as they seek to convince U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett to rule out capital punishment, throw out some charges and exclude the same evidence they want suppressed from the state case.",

      "Bondi\u2019s statements and other official actions \u2014 including a highly choreographed perp walk that saw Mangione led up a Manhattan pier by armed officers, and the Trump administration\u2019s flouting of established death penalty procedures \u2014 \u201chave violated Mr. Mangione\u2019s constitutional and statutory rights and have fatally prejudiced this death penalty case,\u201d his lawyers said.",
      "In a court filing last month, federal prosecutors argued that \u201cpretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect.\u201d",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",

      "But the latest artificial intelligence-powered surveillance was of little use in the early search for a gunman who walked away from the Brown campus after the shooting and slipped unnoticed into the surrounding neighborhoods of Providence, Rhode Island. He evaded detection for days, using a hard-to-trace phone, avoiding facial recognition software by obscuring his face with a medical-type mask and switching the license plates on his rental cars.",
      "It wasn't until a local Reddit user \"blew this case right open\u201d with an old-fashioned tip first posted on the social media platform that police were able to connect a car to Neves Valente, said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha. They finally found the suspect dead Thursday in Salem, New Hampshire, days after he likely killed himself.",
      "The Reddit tipster known only as John is \u201cno less than a hero,\u201d Providence Mayor Brett Smiley wrote Friday to FBI Director Kash Patel, asking for the entirety of the FBI's $50,000 award for information leading investigators to the suspect.",
      "Strangers have invited him to Christmas dinner and suggested he get a \u201ckey to the city and free coffee and doughnuts for life,\u201d according to fellow contributors to Reddit's Providence forum.",
      "It was a stark turn from 2013 when commentators on Reddit and other online discussion boards falsely smeared a Brown University student as a potential suspect in the deadly attack at Boston's famed marathon, just an hour's north of Providence, because of a supposed resemblance to a grainy suspect image.",
      "\u201cHey Reddit, enough Boston bombing vigilantism,\u201d declared a headline in The Atlantic at the time.",
      "\u201cIt definitely went sideways in the Boston Marathon situation,\u201d said Liza Potts, a professor at Michigan State University and director of a digital humanities lab that studied the online response. \u201cThat\u2019s why folks will jokingly refer to the \u2018Reddit Detective Agency\u2019 or the \u2018Reddit Bureau of Investigations.\u2019\u201d",
      "The mistaken connection between the 2013 bombers and a missing Brown student \u2014 who was later found dead of an apparent suicide \u2014 is still remembered by many at the Ivy League school and its surrounding community.",
      "Brown officials this week sought to swiftly tamp down another smear campaign circulating on X and other social media platforms falsely tying a current Brown student to the campus shooting because of his ethnicity, perceived political views and supposed resemblance to a police video of a person of interest. The \u201cunimaginable nightmare\u201d of false accusations led to \u201cnon-stop death threats and hate speech,\u201d the student said in a statement.",
      "Frustrated that tip lines could be jammed with nonsense, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat and former state attorney general, urged social media speculators to \u201cjust shut up.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is simply no need from an investigative point of view for people who have no idea what they\u2019re talking about to offer their stupid and ill-informed views about what happened all over the internet,\u201d Whitehouse said from Congress on Wednesday.",
      "But Potts said some social media has been working better than others, and \u201cof all the spaces that I study, Reddit seems to be getting it right more than not.\"",

      "Reddit's chief moderator for the Providence subreddit said in an interview that he's been on the platform for about 15 years and remembers the trauma that false Boston Marathon report caused.",
      "\u201cThe Providence subreddit is very sensitive about (not) trying to go on a witch hunt or the mob mentality,\u201d he said, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid doxing and because of the platform's culture of anonymity.",

When he finally met with police on Wednesday \u2014 after approaching them on the street and identifying himself as the Reddit tipster \u2014 his information gave new life to a stalled investigation.",
      "With a known vehicle, Providence police started looking through the footage from dozens of AI-powered cameras positioned around the city that can read license plates as well as other identifying details about a car, such as make, color, side damage or even bird droppings on the window.",
      "The cameras, run by surveillance company Flock Safety, spotted his vehicle at least 14 times starting nearly two weeks before the shooting, according to a police affidavit. Providence police could then ask Flock-using police agencies in nearby cities and states to look for the same car, although New Hampshire \u2014 because of privacy restrictions on how long they can hold images \u2014 doesn't have any.",
      "It was a breakthrough Flock was happy to boast about, especially as wariness remains in Providence's immigrant communities about more aggressive federal immigration enforcement. Flock says each of its customers decides when to share camera data, and the city doesn't share it with federal immigration agents. But some still want more safeguards.",
      "\u201cOnce you know what they are, you see them everywhere,\u201d said Madalyn McGunagle, a policy associate at the ACLU of Rhode Island. \"People notice because they\u2019re distinct-looking \u2014 a solar panel on top with a little oval camera underneath.\u201d",

The camera does not have an ability for a user to search for people,\u201d said Flock Safety CEO Garrett Langley in an interview Friday. \u201cOur cameras are focused on vehicles because if you look at America, people drive. It is very hard to get anywhere on foot.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor the majority of our cities, they want to just know who is coming in and who is leaving,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, without John the tipster \u2014 whom local Redditors dubbed \u201cReddit Guy\u201d \u2014 no one would have known how he left.",
      "\u201cSomeone who is in the area and sees stuff all the time, they\u2019re going to be better in a lot of ways than a random camera,\u201d said the Providence subreddit's moderator. \u201cJohn saw this guy going back and forth, unlocking his car and all that, and he just thought it was kind of weird.\u201d",

      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military\u2019s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.",
      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",

      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lego-secret-museum-denmark-headquarters/",
    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:16:25 -0500",
    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel - especially under foot - and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen - a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled - a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-soruces sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer, whose legal name is Jason Deford, has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued his pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters, adding he hopes to meet Jelly Roll for the first time soon.",
      "Beginning at the age of 14, Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for about a decade for convictions including aggravated robbery, shoplifting, drug possession and drug dealing.",
      "In January 2024, \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interviewed Jelly Roll inside the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, where he had once been an inmate. At the time, Jelly Roll had just been nominated for two Grammys.",
      "\"There was a time in my life where I truly thought \u2026 this was it,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"And then coming here, you know, just after getting nominated for two Grammys, it just hits different\u2026I didn't think I'd get emotional, to be honest.",
      "He told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" he wrote hundreds of songs while in jail.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a pardon in Tennessee serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence and been released. Pardons offer a path to get certain civil rights restored, such as the right to vote, although there are some limitations under state law, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations, three of them recently.",
      "Much of his work has become associated with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" that tells the story of someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "In making his case to the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, stating it began as a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Beyond his sold-out shows, he's brought his story to the Senate, where he testified in January 2024 about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Friends and civic leaders backed the pardon application, citing Jelly Roll's transformation.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represents Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",

Her 1975 debut album, \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" was one of the first disco albums to top the charts, cracking the top 25 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Early in her career, Gaynor said she was singing R&B but decided she really wanted to give people music to dance to.",
      "\"I remember that discotheques were very, very new. There were just a couple and what they were was cabaret clubs where they'd just taken away the chairs,\" she recalled.",
      "Her profile continued to grow as she toured the world. As disco faded in the 1980s, Gaynor kept performing around the world. Years later, she found a new purpose through faith and gospel music. Her 2019 album, \"Testimony,\" earned her a Grammy, proving her voice still inspires.",
      "Lessons for new artists",
      "Now, nearly 50 years after her rise to fame, Gaynor is honored with one of the nation's highest distinctions: the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "\"I got a phone call from my manager and I was ecstatic,\" said Gaynor as she learned about the award. \"It was incredible to even think about being accepted as one who deserved that.\"",
      "Gaynor is now parting her wisdom to new artists. Her top takeaway: Don't set out to seek rewards.",
      "\" I would say to them, be about doing the best you can with what God gave you,\" she said. \"All of that stuff is extra.\u00a0 I didn't strive to get a Grammy. I strive to do the best song I could do at that time.\u00a0 I strive to touch people's hearts. I strive to uplift, encourage, and power people And so, be about that.\"",

      "His voice and slurred speech were the result of an injury during childbirth that also caused facial drooping \u2014 a condition for which he was relentlessly bullied. And life at home wasn't much easier. When his parents divorced in 1957, when he was 11, he moved in with his father, who he says was emotionally and physically abusive.",
      "\"It's hard to navigate because you're going to catch it, especially when you're a bit rebellious like me. You're going to get a beating. After a while, you learn to just expect it,\" Stallone told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King during an interview inside his Florida home.",
      "He found solace in the silver screen.",
      "\"I worshipped escapism,\" explained Stallone, especially mythical heroes like Hercules.",
      "Stallone's \"Rocky\" road to success",
      "In his early 20s, he moved to New York City to pursue his dreams, teaching himself to write after struggling as a young actor. In 1975, he wrote a film that would change everything: \"Rocky.\"",
      "At the time, the studio didn't want Stallone to star in his own film, but he insisted. It was a gamble that paid off \u2014 \"Rocky\" went on to win three Academy Awards, including best picture. What should have been one of the happiest nights of his life was also one of the saddest.",

And it's like, what more do you need? Really, what f\u2014ing more do you need to do to say, 'I'm here.'\"",

You mold them, and you dent them, and you hurt them, or you drop them off the table, and they're not the same shape anymore,\" he said. \"I still walk around with it. And I wish I couldn't.

      "From commercial highs to comeback hits",
      "Following the success of \"Rocky,\" Stallone co-wrote and starred in another blockbuster, \"Rambo.\" He played John Rambo, who he refers to as his alter ego.",
      "\"He's my father,\" he explained. \"100%. That's all I had to do was clone him, but the difference is Rambo is sad. Rambo is a disenfranchised child, he was a child of America. And America asked him to do a chore, he did the chore, and he was \u2013 it rejected him.\"",
      "After two hit franchises early in his career, he endured a series of box office flops.",

      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:06:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",

    "story": [
      "Tourists visiting the Trevi Fountain are now going to pay more than just the legendary coin toss over their shoulder to get the Instagrammable selfie in front of one of the world's most celebrated waterworks.",
      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro, or $2.35, fee for tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City's efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome's cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city $7.6 million extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome's Pantheon monument.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro or nearly $6 tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\"We believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\" Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \"We think it's correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",
      "So far this year, around 9 million people have waited in line to get that close-up visit, with some days as many as 70,000 passing through, Gualtieri said. That system now becomes permanent from 9 a.m.-9 p.m., with the fee to be paid by nonresidents. Visitors can either pay in advance online, while waiting in line or by buying tickets at tourist locations around town.",
      "After nightfall, access is open and free.",
      "Pope Urban VIII initially commissioned the fountain in 1640. In 1730, Pope Clement XII revived the project and the current fountain corresponds to the original designs of Roman architect Nicola Salvi.",
      "The towering fountain features at the Titan god flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in \"La Dolce Vita.\"",
      "While bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",
      "European officials have sought to curb overtourism amid protests from residents who say large amounts of visitors are making cities difficult to live in. Last year, Venice became the first city to\u00a0impose a tax for day-tripping tourists. A spate of viral incidents, including a woman who scaled the Trevi Fountain to\u00a0fill up her water bottle\u00a0and a British man who\u00a0carved his and his girlfriends' initials\u00a0into the Colosseum, also drew attention to the issue.",
      "\"These tourists are also vandals, because they have no respect for our cultural heritage, which belongs not just to Italy, but to the whole world,\" said Daniela Santanch\u00e8, Italy's tourism minister, at the time. \"We've introduced a bill with a very simple concept: You break it, you pay for it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:18:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

    "summary": "Economists had expected CPI to rise at an annual rate of 3% last month.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.7% in November, cooler than economists had forecast and a sign that price pressures may be easing.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "The CPI tracks the changes in a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, providing a snapshot of price changes on everyday items such as food and apparel.",
      "So-called core inflation, or CPI data that excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 2.6% over the past 12 months, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Economists polled by FactSet had predicted a 3% increase for that measure.",
      "Food prices rose 2.6% on an annual basis in November, down from 3.1% in September.",
      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",
      "Data collection was disrupted due to the government shutdown, which delayed the September and November CPI reports. The Labor Department on Thursday said it didn't collect October data due to the shutdown, but said it was able to retroactively acquire some non-survey data for the month.",
      "What economists are saying",
      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams told\u00a0CNBC on Friday that data distortions likely pushed the CPI reading down by \"probably a tenth or so.\"",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "summary": "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits over allegations of poor care.",
    "story": [
      "A bankruptcy judge blocked an attempt by a nursing home chain's primary investor to shield himself from settlement payments and liability in lawsuits alleging hundreds of patient injuries and deaths, encouraging those pursuing millions in damages.",
      "Genesis HealthCare, once the nation's largest nursing home chain, filed for Chapter 11 reorganization bankruptcy in July with a proposal to protect its controlling investor, Joel Landau, from legal liability. In court papers, Genesis had originally estimated all its settled and pending cases \u2014 which it said numbered nearly a thousand \u2014 would cost $259 million to resolve.",
      "KFF Health News reported this month that in the years before filing for bankruptcy, Genesis had settled at least 155 patient injury and death lawsuits with provisions that allowed it to delay paying, sometimes for more than a year. As a result, when Genesis filed for bankruptcy in July, it still owed $41 million out of the $58 million promised in those settlements with families of current or former residents, according to the bankruptcy and case records KFF Health News reviewed.",
      "In hearings Wednesday and last week in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Dallas, Judge Stacey G.C. Jernigan said she would not approve a sale of the company's assets that included legal releases from liability for Landau and a private equity associate, David Gefner. Landau, who was seeking to purchase the assets through another company he controlled, did not attend the bankruptcy hearings or respond to a subpoena, lawyers said in court.",
      "\"I'm very encouraged that someone is watching and paying attention to this,\" said Erin Pearson, whose father, James Sanderson, died in 2018 after spending less than a month in a Genesis facility in Albuquerque. \"And the guy who owns the most shares, not only did he not show up but doesn't just get to move things around and rebuy\" the nursing homes.",
      "According to Pearson's lawsuit, filed in 2019, Sanderson developed a bowel obstruction and sepsis while at the facility but was not sent to the hospital for more than a week.",
      "Genesis did not pay Pearson the $500,000 it agreed to in a settlement, according to Pearson's claim filed in bankruptcy court. \"I don't know if I'll ever see that settlement, but I would like to be hopeful,\" Pearson said in an interview Dec. 17.",
      "Genesis, Landau, Gefner, and their attorneys did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a public statement last week, David Harrington, the executive chairman of Genesis' board of directors, praised Landau and his company's investment in Genesis for helping it avoid bankruptcy in 2021. That \"lifeline,\" he said, enabled Genesis to transform into a \"nimble, market-based model dedicated to prioritizing resident and patient care.\"",
      "Ian Norris, who represents 19 clients with lawsuits against Genesis \u2014 including four who have not been paid their settlements \u2014 said the judge's ruling was \"a huge win for all those who were confronting the possibility that they would not be able to recover the settlements that were promised to them by Genesis prior to the bankruptcy.\"",
      "According to Genesis' bankruptcy filings, the company owes more than $1.6 billion in unpaid claims that are not secured by liens, including claims not only from former residents and their families but also from a pension fund; contractors that provided health services and equipment; and Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and West Virginia, which are owed provider taxes. Daniel Simon, a lawyer representing Genesis' owners, said in court on Dec. 17 that $155 million would be available from the proceeds of the sale for these creditors under a bid for the nursing home assets from a new company controlled by Landau and Gefner.",
      "Genesis last month held an auction for its assets and announced that Landau's bid was the best, but the U.S. Trustee's Office and creditors objected, saying Genesis had unfairly excluded one group from bidding and downplayed the value of another group's bid that would have provided more money to creditors. Jernigan said there were too many irregularities in the auction for her to approve it and ordered it be redone under the watch of the U.S. Trustee's Office.",
      "\"I am aware that there is huge concern about Mr. Landau, and he is not here,\" Jernigan said last week. \"There is no way I can approve these releases without him on the witness stand and me being convinced of his good faith.\"",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who along with two Senate colleagues filed an amicus brief questioning the fairness of the auction, said in a media statement: \"A private equity company tried to abuse the bankruptcy system to slither out of paying what they owe to neglected seniors in its nursing homes. This is a textbook case of why we need to get private equity out of health care altogether, and this decision is a good step forward in the fight to deliver relief for the victims of Genesis.\"",
      "In the Dec. 17 hearing, representatives of the company controlled by Landau and Gefner said they would bid again for the remains of Genesis without the promise of liability releases. The auction is expected to occur in January. Simon, the lawyer for Genesis, said at the hearing that the judge's ruling \"has humbled us.\"",
      "Lawyers for former and current Genesis residents said they hope to sue Landau and other parties that controlled the company and led it into bankruptcy. John Anthony, a Tampa attorney who represents 341 claimants, said, \"The victims believe that Mr. Landau richly deserves his day in court, so he can explain to a jury of his peers how he has apparently gotten so rich running all these supposedly insolvent facilities into the ground.\"",

The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",

      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",

      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",

      "Is it a recurring bonus?",
      "The \"warrior dividend\" is a one-time pay bump for the nation's 1.45 million\u00a0military service members, according to the White House.",
      "\"1776; as you know, our great nation was founded in the crucible of revolution in that year,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media video posted Thursday.",
      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",

      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",

      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

      "Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.",
      "TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.",
      "The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT \u2014 the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.",
      "After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.",
      "Trump Media's strategic shift",
      "For Trump Media, the merger represents another strategic shift, given its 2021 launch as a business focusing on the conservative-leaning social media space.",
      "More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with \"America-first\" strategies.",
      "The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's \"America first\" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.",
      "\"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology,\" Nunes said on the call.",
      "He added, \"This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance.\"",
      "After the merger closes next year, the company will \"quickly seek approvals to site and build the company's first utility-scale power plant,\" Nunes said. \"We expect siting to commence by year-end 2026, sending us on the path to build future plants expected to be 350 megawatt to 500 megawatt.\"",
      "AI power needs",
      "With tech companies building AI data centers across the U.S., their need for power is \"growing exponentially,\" according to a report earlier this year from Deloitte. Power demand for AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, up to 123 gigawatts from 4 gigawatts last year, the consulting firm noted.",
      "The combination represents \"a major play on creating the first public nuclear fusion company in the U.S.,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. TAE's investors include Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs, he noted.",
      "TAE has \"safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years... putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,\" Ives said.",

      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",

      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers are warning travelers to beware of a range of scams that tend to proliferate during the holiday season, including phishing schemes involving phony websites, as well as criminals who impersonate airlines and hotels.",
      "Online travel fraud has surged, accounting for $1 trillion in global financial losses in 2024, according to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which issued the warning on Wednesday. For example, such scams can lead to consumers paying for fake trips or booking accommodations that look nothing like how they are pictured online.",
      "\"While the winter holidays are one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, they're also one of the busiest seasons for scammers impersonating airlines, hotels and rental platforms,\" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the panel's ranking member, said in a statement. \"As millions of Americans prepare to travel to see their loved ones over the next few weeks, everyone should also prepare to protect themselves against rampant travel scams.\"",
      "The JEC, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers that advises Congress on economic issues, also called on the Federal Trade Commission to indicate what steps it is taking alongside U.S. technology companies to protect consumers from overseas scam networks. Organized foreign criminals stole $10 billion from Americans in 2024, up 66% from the prior year.",
      "In a letter, the panel pressed the FTC to detail how it is working with social media sites, dating platforms, financial technology companies and other actors to disrupt travel fraud. Lawmakers also requested details on how much money the FTC has allocated to protect Americans from overseas fraud.",
      "The panel's Democratic minority cited data from travel and payment firms showing a sharp rise in online fraud around the holidays.",
      "Travel fraud is among the most common types of criminal activity, according to the\u00a0FTC, which said it accounted for $274 million in U.S. consumer losses in 2024. Research from the Mastercard Economics Institute has found that\u00a0fraud spikes by up to 28%\u00a0during peak travel seasons.",
      "Common travel scams",
      "Criminals employ a range of tactics to extract payment details or other personal information from travelers. One common ploy is to send a text message claiming that a person's flight has been canceled, according to the JEC.",
      "\"These texts, which appear to come from major airlines, direct customers to a fake number or link to rebook their travel,\" warned the panel, which advises people to verify any schedule changes with their airline.",
      "Scammers may also pose as legitimate business representatives in replying to travelers' social media posts about flight delays or other travel headaches. In addition, fraudsters are known to pay to appear in online search results, advertising phony customer service numbers that lead directly to a scammer.",
      "How to avoid getting burned",
      "The JEC advised travelers always to consult official company websites or apps when seeking information, and not to click on links sent by text or email directing them to a website. Consumers should also be leery of online ads, sponsored search results or links posted on social media, the lawmakers warned.",
      "If a travel company is unfamiliar, meanwhile, the panel advises travelers to check sites like the Better Business Bureau, where other customers can post reviews and complaints. Clues indicating a possible scam include misspelled or extra words in a website address.",
      "Consumers should also beware vendors that describe accommodations as luxurious, but don't provide details such as a hotel's name or location, the JEC said. If a company does not list its cancellation or refund policy, or requests payment in cryptocurrency, that could also be suspicious, according to the committee.",

      "At a briefing on the program, Bessent projected that the $1,000 deposited into a Trump Account by the government when a child is born would grow to over $600,000 by retirement age, assuming that the historic growth rate continues. For families who invest $5,000 each year in the accounts, that sum would grow to $1 million, he added.",
      "Parents may sign up their children by making an election on a new IRS form \u2014 Form 4547 \u2014 when they file their taxes. A financial institution will receive the child's funds and activate the account. Trump accounts are to be invested in an authorized investment, like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028 are eligible to receive the $1,000 government contribution into their accounts. Children under 18 who have a Social Security number can receive up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians or others in their account.",
      "Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is contributing $75 million as part of a 50-state push for businesses and philanthropic organizations to donate in each state. Dalio will \"boost funding for Trump accounts for kids across Connecticut,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Ray and Barbara Dalio through Dalio Philanthropies announced today that they are joining the Dell family in seeding the new Trump Administration investment accounts with an additional $250 per child for approximately 300,000 children in Connecticut,\" the Dalios said in a statement on their foundation's website.",
      "The accounts were created under President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" tax and spending bill earlier this year. Households of any income may open an account, and all such accounts qualify for the one-time $1,000 government contribution.",
      "Billionaires Michael and Susan Dell donated a historic $6.25 billion earlier this month, pledging to deposit $250 into the accounts of 25 million children ages 10 and younger as an incentive to save for the future.",
      "Families will be able to start making financial contributions on July 5, 2026. They won't be able to withdraw funds from the Trump account before a child turns 18, except under certain conditions.",

    "story": [
      "A robocall scam is targeting hundreds of thousands of consumers each week, with fraudsters impersonating employees of Walmart in an effort to obtain people's personal information, according to a telecommunications security company and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "Targets of the scheme receive a call from someone claiming to be from Walmart asking if they have authorized the purchase of a PlayStation 5 video game console and accompanying 3D headset. The person is then invited to \"cancel\" the order by connecting with a live customer service representative, who asks for credit card, Social Security number and other personal data.",
      "YouMail, which makes technology to block robocalls and scam texts, has been tracking calls associated with the so-called phishing campaign in cooperation with the FCC.",
      "\"It's too easy to get tricked when you feel pressure to act right away to address a problem that might cost you money,\" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told CBS News in an email, noting that the scam targets tens of millions of U.S. consumers.",
      "What you'll be told",
      "YouMail said the thieves behind the scam tend to stick to the following script:",
      "\"Hi, this is [NAME] from Walmart, and this is not a telemarketing call. We have detected a pre-authorized purchase of $919.45 for a PlayStation 5 and 3D headset, recently placed through a Walmart account registered to your name and phone number. If you did not authorize this purchase, press 1 to speak with a Walmart representative immediately.\"",
      "According to YouMail data, the bad actors have used more than 50 aliases as part of the ongoing robocall scam. They relied mainly on male names like David, Brandon, Michael and Paul earlier in the campaign, before swapping them for more female aliases in the second half of this year, such as Olivia, Jessica and Naomi.",
      "The scam first surfaced as early as 2023, and Quilici said it has expanded since then. \"Most campaigns start at low volume before they ramp,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, the FCC issued a letter to the CEO of SK Teleco, raising concerns that the South Korea-based telecommunications company could be transmitting the scam robocalls and ordering it to block the calls.",
      "SK Teleco could not be reached for comment.",
      "\"Scammers and thieves using our phone networks to defraud consumers or steal personal data is illegal, and voice service providers must be part of the solution,\" FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said in a Dec. 2 statement.",
      "The FCC declined further comment, citing the agency's ongoing investigation into the scam.",
      "The scammers are targeting Walmart because it is a trusted brand with a huge customer base, according to Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of AI and innovation for Norton, a cybersecurity company.",
      "\"Walmart shoppers may also be more vulnerable, since many are budget-conscious and quick to react to unexpected charges, especially when the scam uses realistic AI-generated voices that sound similar to the automated calls they already receive from the retailer,\" he said in an email to CBS News.",
      "Walmart directed customers seeking more information about scams to the company's fraud alert\u00a0page.",
      "Billions of calls per month",
      "Americans now receive roughly\u00a02.5 billion robocalls a month, according to an October report from the U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization.",

    "summary": "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, its highest level since September 2021.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",

      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",

      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "story": [
      "At least 15 files that were released by the Justice Department Friday in relation to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were no longer available on the department's website on Saturday, CBS News has determined.",
      "CBS News downloaded the complete set of documents on Friday and compared it to what is available Saturday.",
      "It was unclear why the files are missing. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "In a social media post to its X account Saturday night that seemed to touch on the issue, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a credenza desk. The photos showed former President Bill Clinton, and another was of the pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of President Trump, Epstein, and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.",
      "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.",
      "Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.",
      "Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions \u2014 records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.",
      "The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability",
      "Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.",
      "The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.",
      "There was a series of never-before-seen photos of Clinton but fleetingly few of Mr. Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.",
      "Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors' names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.",

      "A U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that the interdiction of a sanctioned vessel off Venezuela followed a similar playbook as the earlier U.S. seizure of an oil tanker near Venezuela, suggesting this is not an isolated action but part of a broader, ongoing enforcement campaign.",
      "The Venezuelan government later confirmed the vessel seized Saturday was a private ship that transported Venezuelan oil, calling the action of the U.S. \"theft and kidnapping.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department released thousands of new photos and records on Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted in the initial release, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a\u00a0photo of a folder\u00a0or\u00a0something else that isn't fully redacted\u00a0precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "The Justice Department released another tranche of files on Saturday, including a 119-page transcript from the grand jury proceedings involving Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. A White House spokesperson shared a social media post that suggested the file was the unredacted version of Friday's blacked-out document of the same length.",
      "It's unclear if any other documents that were mostly or entirely redacted on Friday were released in an unredacted form Saturday. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for more details but did not immediately receive a response.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in. The 119-page grand jury transcript that was published Saturday takes out names and identifying information, but leaves in almost everything else.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional layers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein's and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

    "summary": "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik's decision to drop out came after President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement in the race at this stage.",
    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump on Saturday endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman for governor. Read the story here.",
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik dropped out of the New York governor's race Friday, concluding that a potentially fractious GOP primary could hurt Republicans' chances in an uphill statewide contest, as President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement at this stage.",
      "Stefanik pointed to the risks in a statement to supporters, writing: \"While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's political future is now unclear, as she said she is not planning to run for re-election in Congress. Stefanik, considered a rising MAGA leader, was initially set to leave Congress after Mr. Trump picked her in November 2024 for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, before her nomination was pulled by the administration in March over concerns about a narrowing Republican majority in the House.",
      "Two sources confirmed to CBS News that Stefanik spoke directly with President Trump on Thursday to discuss her decision to leave the gubernatorial race. Their conversation was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Mr. Trump later issued a statement following her announcement applauding Stefanik, calling her \"a fantastic person and Congresswoman from New York State\" and describing her as \"a tremendous talent.\" He said she would have \"great success\" in whatever she chooses next and signaled his continued support.",
      "A Republican member of Congress with direct knowledge of the race told CBS News they believed Stefanik ultimately concluded that a contested Republican primary would be difficult and potentially damaging, even if she were likely to win. The other major candidate is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, another Trump ally.",
      "Under New York GOP rules, candidates must secure at least 25% of the weighted vote at the state party's February convention to qualify for the June primary ballot, or otherwise submit nominating petitions.",
      "While Stefanik was believed to have early support representing well above that threshold \u2014 possibly more than 75% of the weighted vote due to early endorsements from local party officials \u2014 New York Republicans told CBS News that a challenge from Blakeman still risked becoming a prolonged intraparty fight.",
      "The eventual nominee is expected to face off against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. New York hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2002, though Hochul won her 2022 race by a single-digit margin of\u00a0 6.4 percentage points, which spurred renewed interest among Republicans who viewed the result as a sign of potential Democratic vulnerability.",
      "\"My gut tells me this is not the right political time,\" Stefanik told New York Magazine in an interview on Friday. \"This is not the sort of array of things lining up \u2014 which is so difficult in New York, which is incredibly difficult in a picture-perfect year\u2013let alone with a primary and everything else.\"",
      "\"We viewed it as a waste of resources,\" she said, also citing family considerations. \"I have a 4-year old son, and that is a priority for our family.\"",
      "A senior House Republican official also said Stefanik was frustrated that Mr. Trump declined to endorse her early and effectively clear the field for her, a move that Stefanik allies believed could have avoided a divisive primary.",
      "Mr. Trump did call Blakeman after he entered the race, according to sources familiar with the phone call. He told the county executive that he did not like seeing \"good Republicans\" face each other in an electoral battle.",
      "Asked about the race on Dec. 10, the president repeatedly emphasized his reluctance to publicly intervene, stressing his personal relationships with both candidates and concern about collateral damage from a contested primary.",
      "\"First of all, he's a friend. She's a friend,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"These are two great people running. In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be damaging each other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump went on to praise both candidates, saying, \"Elise is fantastic, and Bruce is. They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running.\"",
      "Pointing to the state GOP convention, Trump said, \"I think you'll know pretty much at the end of February what's going to happen. And I'll probably have to, you know, do what I want to do.\"",
      "\"We have two very talented people. Either one should win against the Democrats,\" he added.",
      "After Stefanik announced she would end her campaign, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised her record, calling her \"an incredible advocate\" for her Upstate New York district and \"a true friend\" to Mr. Trump. Leavitt, who previously worked for Stefanik as a top adviser, added that she is \"a great leader, and an even better person.\"",
      "Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership and one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, had been viewed by New York Republicans as a formidable contender given her national profile and fundraising strength \u2014 over $12 million raised.",
      "But she faced an uphill battle in deep-blue New York, with a recent Siena College poll showing Hochul with a double-digit lead versus both Republicans at this stage of the race.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:51:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used by Brown University shooting suspect Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced late Thursday that the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used eight years ago by the now-deceased man accused of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor.",
      "\"This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,\" Noem said on X. \"At President Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"",
      "Noem said the suspected shooter,\u00a0Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the program in 2017 and was issued a green card.",
      "What is the diversity visa program?",
      "Launched in the 1990s, the program offers 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with relatively low rates of immigration to the U.S., with recipients selected at random using a lottery. Every year, tens of millions of people vie for visas through the program.",
      "In order to qualify for a diversity visa, applicants must have at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a field that requires training. They are also required to undergo vetting and an interview before getting a visa.",
      "The program was created by Congress, and it's not clear under what legal mechanism the administration can order a pause. Most visas issued through the lottery are overseen by the State Department, and a small number are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 which is part of DHS \u2014 for applicants already in the U.S.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also paused the issuance of diversity visas \"until we can be sure we know exactly who we are letting into our country,\" a State Department spokesperson told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Criticism from Trump administration",
      "President Trump is a longstanding critic of the diversity visa lottery program, arguing it could pose security risks and isn't sufficiently merit-based, like employment-based visas. He pushed to end it early in his first term, after a man who had received a diversity visa killed eight people in a truck-ramming attack in New York City. Supporters of the visas say recipients are vetted and argue the program is good for the U.S. economy and the country's image abroad.",
      "The first Trump administration suspended the program in 2020, part of a\u00a0broader set of restrictions\u00a0on legal immigration that cited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reversed that policy\u00a0in 2021.",
      "Shooting suspect in the U.S.",
      "Neves Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, officials said in a press conference late Thursday.",
      "More than a decade before getting a diversity visa, Neves Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa in 2000 to attend graduate school at Brown University, according to a local police affidavit that was attached to his arrest warrant. Brown's president says he studied at the Ivy League school for a few months starting in the fall of 2000, but he took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later.",
      "Authorities said Neves Valente was found dead by suicide in a storage unit in New Hampshire late Thursday, ending a days-long investigation following a shooting at Brown that killed two students and wounded nine over the weekend. Authorities say he is also believed to be responsible for the deadly shooting of an MIT professor in suburban Boston two days after the shooting at Brown.",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department has disclosed thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department began disclosing\u00a0thousands of files and photos related to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, following years of pressure from lawmakers and abuse survivors for more transparency into the government's investigations into the disgraced financier.",
      "The records were released in accordance with the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which passed last month and required the government to release virtually all Epstein-related files within 30 days.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said more files will be released \"over the next couple of weeks,\" even though the law required the documents to be disclosed by Friday. He later told lawmakers that the Justice Department needed more time to pore through the records and redact victims' names.",
      "Congressional Democrats have accused the Justice Department of failing to comply with the law, arguing the documents are too heavily redacted and should have been released in full on Friday.",
      "Where to find the Epstein files",
      "The files that were disclosed Friday under the Epstein Files Transparency Act are available on the Justice Department's website, broken into different data sets. The total number of files in the first five sets alone is roughly 3,900, nearly all of which are PDFs.",
      "CBS News is also uploading the records to a searchable database, which is available here, though many of the files are photos, not text documents.",
      "Here are the Justice Department's records:",

      "Data Set 5",
      "Data Set 6",
      "Data Set 7",
      "What's in the new Epstein files?",
      "Thousands of the files are images, including photos that were seemingly taken in Epstein's mansion in Manhattan or his private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Those include photos of his bedroom in New York, his risque wall art and a taxidermied tiger.",
      "Many photos show Epstein socializing with his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. Former President Bill Clinton also appears in several of the images \u2014 in some cases, the former president is posing with celebrities like Michael Jackson and Mick Jagger. A spokesperson has acknowledged that Clinton traveled with Epstein on several occasions, but says he was not aware of Epstein's crimes, and accused the Justice Department of trying to scapegoat Clinton on Friday.",
      "Some of the photos are redacted \u2014 in certain cases, they show Epstein posing with people whose faces are obscured.",
      "There are also a number of investigative documents, some of which have heavy redactions. In a few cases, documents are almost entirely redacted.",
      "Why were some of the Epstein files redacted?",
      "The law that requires the Justice Department to release the files only allows redactions under narrow circumstances, including to take out Epstein survivors' personal information, violent images or child sexual abuse material. The government is also allowed to temporarily withhold records that \"would jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Records cannot be withheld solely because they would cause \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\"",
      "Some redactions in the documents released Friday appeared to omit victims' names, but the exact reasons for every redaction are unclear. The law also requires the department to give Congress a list of its redactions within 15 days.",
      "What was Epstein investigated for and charged with?",
      "The files that were released Friday are expected to stem from the litany of investigations surrounding Epstein and Maxwell, stretching back at least 20 years.",
      "Allegations about Epstein's conduct appeared to emerge on the government's radar as early as the 1990s, when survivor Maria Farmer says she reported to the FBI that Epstein had abused her. In a lawsuit, she has accused the government of failing to look into her allegations.",
      "Epstein was investigated by local police in Florida and federal prosecutors starting in the mid-2000s. That probe ended with a controversial 2007 deal in which federal prosecutors in Miami agreed not to charge him, in exchange for a guilty plea on prostitution charges in state court.",
      "More than a decade later, Epstein was charged in New York federal court with abusing and trafficking dozens of underage girls. Maxwell was charged with sex trafficking conspiracy the following year, and was convicted at trial and sentenced to 20 years in prison.",
      "Files from several other probes could be made public. The government has investigated the circumstances surrounding Epstein's death in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial in 2019, officially ruled a suicide. And it has investigated Miami prosecutors' decision to cut a non-prosecution deal.",
      "Why the Epstein files are being released now",
      "The files are being released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which Congress passed and President Trump signed into law in November. The legislation gave the attorney general 30 days to publicly release documents related to Epstein, his accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, the government's investigations into both and internal records about the cases.",
      "The legislation was the result of years of pressure from Epstein and Maxwell's survivors, who pushed lawmakers for more transparency about how the government handled both of their cases. Epstein's death fueled conspiracy theories about his connections to high-powered figures in government and the business world.",
      "The calls for transparency reached new heights over the summer. The Justice Department conducted a review of the Epstein files in the government's possession, and concluded that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he had blackmailed prominent figures. The findings infuriated many of the president's supporters who had been calling for the release of the Epstein files for years, and opened the door for a bipartisan push to unveil the records.",
      "California Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat, was the lead sponsor of the Epstein Files Transparency Act. He introduced the bill in July, and GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky filed a discharge petition aimed at forcing a vote on the measure. The push was delayed by opposition from House Speaker Mike Johnson and the government shutdown in the fall. But in November, the petition received the final signature required to bring the bill up for a vote.",
      "It passed the House by a vote of 427 to 1 and the Senate unanimously approved it. President Trump signed it into law on Nov. 19, despite spending months pressuring Republicans to oppose it, starting the clock on the 30-day deadline.",
      "In the wake of Congress' passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, three separate judges approved Justice Department requests to unseal grand jury transcripts from investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. One of those rulings stemmed from grand jury proceedings in South Florida in 2005 and 2007. Epstein ultimately escaped federal charges there and instead agreed to plead guilty to state prostitution charges.",
      "The other two court orders came from judges in New York, where Epstein and Maxwell were charged in 2019 and 2020, respectively.",
      "When will the next group of Epstein files be released?",
      "It's unclear. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News earlier Friday that the department would release more files \"over the next couple of weeks.\"",
      "\"We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim \u2014 their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected \u2014 is completely protected,\" Blanche said.",
      "That timeline does not comply with the law, which required the release of all eligible files by Dec. 19. The department's office of public affairs said before Friday's release that the \"initial deadline is being met as we work diligently to protect victims.\"",
      "Blanche's comments, and the department's failure to release all of the files, angered many Democrats who have harshly criticized the administration for its handling of the documents. Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, and Rep. Robert Garcia of California, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, accused the Trump administration of violating the law and suggested they could take legal action.",
      "\"Donald Trump and the Department of Justice are now violating federal law as they continue covering up the facts and the evidence about Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long, billion-dollar, international sex trafficking ring,\" Raskin and Garcia said in a joint statement. \"For months, Pam Bondi has denied survivors the transparency and accountability they have demanded and deserve and has defied the Oversight Committee's subpoena. The Department of Justice is now making clear it intends to defy Congress itself, even as it gives star treatment to Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell.\"",
      "Raskin and Garcia said they are \"examining all legal options\" given Blanche's earlier admission.",
      "\"The survivors of this nightmare deserve justice, the co-conspirators must be held accountable, and the American people deserve complete transparency from DOJ,\" they said.",

      "In a statement, Stefanik \u2014 who had just entered the race about seven weeks ago \u2014 said in a social media post that \"while we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's decision came after President Trump signaled he wasn't going to endorse a candidate in this stage of the race. Stefanik also indicated that her decision was made with her family in mind.",
      "\"While many know me as Congresswoman, my most important title is Mom,\" she added. \"I believe that being a parent is life's greatest gift and greatest responsibility. I have thought deeply about this and I know that as a mother, I will feel profound regret if I don't further focus on my young son's safety, growth, and happiness - particularly at his tender age.\"",

      "At the time, a spokesperson for Stefanik blasted Blakeman for entering the race.",
      "\"Bruce Blakeman is an early Christmas present to Kathy Hochul as he works to blow Republicans' best chance to win,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "F-15 fighter jets, A-10 Thunderbolts \u2014 known as \"Warthogs\" \u2014 and Apache attack helicopters were used to target ISIS positions in Syria on Friday, U.S. officials told CBS News. F-16 fighter jets from Jordan were also involved in the operation.",
      "U.S. Central Command described the operation as a \"massive strike\" and indicated that it was retaliatory in a post on X. In a follow-up post, U.S. Central Command said it used \"more than 100 precision munitions targeting known ISIS infrastructure and weapons sites.\"",

    "summary": "A federal judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Friday it will appeal a pair of decisions tossing out the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "The appeal was expected, as the White House and Attorney Pam Bondi had indicated that the Trump administration would ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review last month's rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie. But it comes as Halligan and Justice Department lawyers have so far twice failed to secure a new indictment against James.",
      "Halligan's name is on the notices of appeal, and she is listed\u00a0as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Currie ruled that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated federal law and the Constitution's Appointments Clause and ordered the criminal charges brought against Comey and James to be dismissed.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her\u00a0opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her\u00a0ruling in the James case.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's defense team in the since-ended criminal case stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents. She was tapped by Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in eastern Virginia in September.",
      "Soon after Halligan temporarily took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, she secured indictments against Comey and James. Comey was charged with two counts stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020 and pleaded not guilty. He was indicted just days before the statute of limitations for the offenses was set to expire.",
      "James faced charges of bank fraud and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Since Currie ordered the cases against Comey and James to be tossed out, Halligan has attempted to secure a new indictment against James. But grand juries in Norfolk and Alexandria, Virginia, have each\u00a0separately refused to indict James again.",
      "It's unclear whether Halligan has sought to re-indict Comey, though Currie suggested in her November decision that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in his case because the statute of limitations expired at the end of September. Additionally, a separate federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked the Justice Department from accessing material it seized from one of Comey's friends more than five years ago, which Halligan had relied on when she presented the case against Comey to a grand jury in September.",
      "Comey and James had also moved to have the criminal charges against them tossed out on the grounds that their respective prosecutions were vindictive and selective. Judges overseeing their cases had not yet ruled on those bids, however, when their cases were dismissed.",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 16:18:02 -0500",
    "summary": "Nine drug manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts in exchange for tariff exemptions.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Friday announced new agreements with nine pharmaceutical manufacturers aimed at reducing certain prescription drug prices.",
      "\"Starting next year, American drug prices will come down fast and furious and will soon be the lowest in the developed world,\" Mr.\u00a0 Trump said Friday at the White House.",
      "Under the deal, the nine manufacturers will offer their drugs to Medicaid recipients at most-favored-nation discounts, a policy that requires the prices to match those paid by patients in other developed nations. The nine companies will also offer medicines \"at a deep discount off the list price\" to Americans through TrumpRx, according to the White House. The Trump administration plans to offer tariff exemptions to the drugmakers for three years in exchange for the MFN pricing commitments.",
      "According to a White House fact sheet, the drugs that will be covered include treatments for chronic conditions, including type two diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hepatitis B and C, human immunodeficiency virus and certain cancers.",
      "Amgen, Boehringer Ingelheim, Bristol Myers Squibb, Genentech, Gilead Science, GSK, Merck, Novartis, and Sanofi will sell drugs on TrumpRx, the administration's discount drug pricing program. TrumpRx \u2014 which the administration has said will launch early next year \u2014 will not sell drugs directly, but instead will direct consumers to lower prices elsewhere.",
      "Senior administration officials said that roughly 30-40% of Medicaid drug prices are currently higher than what patients in other wealthy nations pay, mostly Europeans, and that the prices of those drugs will drop.",
      "The president has previously announced agreements with AstraZeneca, EMD Serono, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk and Pfizer. The White House said it has made MFN deals with 14 of the 17 biggest drug manufacturers in the world. The three drugmakers that were not part of the announcement are AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson and Regeneron, but the president said that deals involving the remaining three could be announced at another time.",
      "\"[The policy] affects every American so that they have the dignity to access the same medical innovations that our tax dollars helped develop,\" a White House official said. \"This is about healthcare fairness.\"",
      "But questions remain about how the president's deals with drugmakers will work \u2014 and who will feel the difference at the pharmacy counter. Most-favored-nation pricing could have a muted impact on Medicaid patients, experts say, because the program already has a statutory \"best price\" protection that guarantees the lowest price offered to any U.S. commercial payer. Also, while it could save states money, Medicaid users typically don't pay out-of-pocket for their medication.",
      "Medicaid recipients are \"starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out to CBS News after the president announced the Pfizer deal.",
      "The White House said the new agreement represents more than $150 billion in new investment commitments in manufacturing and research and development in the U.S.",
      "In addition to the drugmakers' commitment to MFN and TrumpRx, several drugmakers' will be donating active pharmaceutical ingredients to the Strategic Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients Reserve, an initiative designed to stockpile critical raw materials and drug components in order to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign drug manufacturing during disruptions like pandemics.",
      "\"This is the president's answer to pharmaceutical vulnerability, such that when the disaster strikes, whether it's natural catastrophe, pandemic or a national security emergency, America will be ready,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials said the administration expects to see \"major reductions in Medicaid prices\" as it aims to match the prices of several Medicaid drugs with MFN levels.",
      "\"Medicaid has prices that are much higher than what other European nations pay,\" a senior administration official said. \"Americans should not pay more than other developed nations.\"",
      "But injectable drugs and infusion medications will not be available on TrumpRx because the White House has concluded these drugs must be administered by health care providers and should not be on a direct-to-consumer platform.",

      "As the public begins to sort through the deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein released by the Department of Justice on Friday, some of the material might seem familiar.",
      "That's because there's been a steady stream of material made public from various investigations into the deceased sex offender during the last year, some of which undoubtedly overlaps with the voluminous Justice Department release mandated by federal legislation passed in November.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave Attorney General Pam Bondi until Dec. 19 to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices (with some personal information redacted to protect victims).",
      "Some of that material \u2014 tens of thousands of pages \u2014 has already been released by a House committee that subpoenaed the Justice Department and Epstein's estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have indicated they're still expecting even more documents to be produced by Epstein's estate in the future, as well as material from banking institutions he did business with. They've pledged to release more documents as they come in.",
      "Among other things, the documents released so far include emails and text messages showing that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest.",
      "Here is an overview of documents already disclosed to the public:",
      "Dec. 18, 2025:\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a batch of 68 photos from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein's estate. Among them were photos of passages from \"Lolita\" written on a woman's body; a picture of a Ukrainian passport, with details blacked out; and text messages about 18-year-old from Russia.",
      "Dec. 12, 2025: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released another selection of photos from Epstein's estate.The photos include snapshots of prominent figures like President Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Dec. 4, 2025: Democrats on the Oversight Committee released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island known as Little St. James that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "Nov. 12, 2025: The House Oversight Committee released 20,000 records from Epstein's estate, including scores of emails. The disgraced financier often referenced Mr. Trump, writing of the president at one point: \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\" Other messages showed him bantering with influential Harvard professor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and attempting to reconnect with Bill Gates. None of those men have been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Oct. 30, 2025: Buckingham Palace announced that it was stripping the king's younger brother of his titles, relegating Prince Andrew to his civilian name, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The announcement came weeks after news outlets in the United Kingdom revealed a 2011 email in which Andrew told Epstein, \"we are in this together.\" The former prince has been accused of sexually assaulting a young Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein; Andrew settled Giuffre's lawsuit but denied wrongdoing.",
      "Sept. 8, 2025: House Oversight released a tranche from Epstein's estate, including a 2003 birthday note to Epstein that appeared to be signed by Mr. Trump. The letter, written inside a drawing of what appears to be the form of a woman, ends with, \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret. Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "The president denied penning the message, and Republicans accused Democrats of cherry-picking documents.",
      "Sept. 2, 2025: The panel released more than 33,000 pages of files from the Justice Department, including court documents, flight records, and a video of Epstein's cell block from before his death that includes a minute missing from earlier videos. Many of the documents were already in the public domain. Democratic lawmakers said just 3% of the pages were new. Those disclosures included logs of flights on Epstein's plane from 2000 to 2014 that were kept by Customs and Border Protection, according to Democrats.",
      "Aug. 22, 2025: The Justice Department released a transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for involvement in trafficking. Maxwell said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me.\" She said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings.\" She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "Feb. 27, 2025: The White House gave a group of 15 conservative influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Several influencers said the binders contained little new info.",

    "summary": "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change its name.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, will\u00a0air on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",

    "summary": "Federal prosecutors have unveiled charges against six more people accused of defrauding programs in Minnesota \u2014 adding to a scandal that has ensnared over 90 people..",
    "story": [
      "Federal prosecutors unveiled charges Thursday against another six people, accusing them of defrauding public assistance programs in Minnesota \u2014 including two men they allege traveled to the state for that express purpose.",
      "The latest indictments add fuel to a scandal that has now led to charges against\u00a0more than 90 people who have been accused, and in many cases convicted, of bilking hundreds of millions of dollars from the Midwestern state, putting Gov. Tim Walz's administration in the hot seat and drawing attacks from President Trump.",
      "Thursday's charges focus on housing assistance and autism services. And the pandemic-era food aid fraud case that set off the scandal is still brewing.",
      "Minnesota is far from the only state that has grappled with allegations of public assistance fraud, especially scams targeting pandemic aid funds. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Minnesota faces a particularly large problem, pointing to 14 different Medicaid programs that the state has flagged for \"significant fraud problems.\" He suggested total losses could reach into the billions.",
      "\"The fraud is not small. It isn't isolated. The magnitude cannot be overstated,\" Thompson said at a press conference Thursday. \"What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's a staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "Walz, whose administration has faced scrutiny for its handling of the issue, has vowed to crack down. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has sharply criticized Minnesota \u2014 and he's lashed out at the state's large Somali-American community as most, but not all, of the defendants are of Somali descent.",
      "Here's what to know about the new charges and the wider scandal:",
      "Pennsylvania natives accused of \"fraud tourism\" in housing program",
      "An alleged fraud scheme involving a now-defunct housing stabilization program in Minnesota expanded Thursday, as federal prosecutors charged five new people with wire fraud \u2014 including two Philadelphia men who allegedly traveled from halfway across the country because they heard the state programs presented \"a good opportunity to make money.\"",
      "The program in question was launched in 2020 to help seniors and people with disabilities find, apply for, move into and stay in housing. Offered as a benefit in Minnesota's Medicaid plan, it was recognized at the time as the nation's first program of its kind. State officials shut it down earlier this year, however, after finding \"large-scale fraud.\"",
      "Federal prosecutors have said in the past that the program was vulnerable to fraud because of its \"low barriers to entry\" and light recordkeeping rules.",
      "In court papers, prosecutors claim the two Pennsylvanians signed up as providers for the program despite no clear ties to the state. The two men allegedly submitted some $3.5 million in claims, often sending in \"fake and inflated bills,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Thompson said the state \"has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry.\"",
      "A third defendant was charged with fraudulently claiming $1.4 million. Prosecutors say he flew to Amsterdam shortly after he was subpoenaed by federal authorities last month, and he has not returned to the U.S. since then. And two other new defendants were accused of submitting around $750,000 in fraudulent claims for the program.",
      "The Justice Department charged eight other people with allegedly defrauding the same program in September. Six of those defendants have pleaded not guilty, and two pleaded guilty.",
      "New charges in alleged autism services fraud scheme",
      "Charges were also unsealed Thursday in an alleged fraud scheme that hit a second state program, one that provides services to children with autism.",
      "Prosecutors allege that the new defendant in this case raked in millions from Medicaid reimbursements, many of which were inflated or for services that weren't provided.",
      "In court papers, the Justice Department alleged the defendant's company claimed to offer one-on-one behavioral therapy to children with autism, but actually employed \"unqualified\" 18- and 19-year-olds. He allegedly recruited parents within Minnesota's Somali community to sign up for the program, helped to get their kids qualified for autism services and, in some cases, paid kickbacks to the parents.",
      "Federal officials charged a different person with defrauding Minnesota's autism program in September, leveling similar allegations. That defendant pleaded guilty on Thursday.",
      "As with the housing stabilization program, claims in the autism program have grown rapidly in recent years, according to court papers unsealed by the government on Thursday.",
      "CBS News has reached out to attorneys for the six defendants who were charged Thursday for comment.",
      "Feds tease another possible fraud case",
      "The Justice Department unsealed a search warrant Thursday for a Minnesota business that participated in yet another state Medicaid-funded program, which offers health and safety assistance at home for adults with disabilities.",
      "The business and its owners have not been criminally charged. CBS News has reached out to the business for comment.",
      "In an affidavit attached to the search warrant, an FBI agent claimed there was a \"massive scheme to defraud\" the state's Integrated Community Supports program, which he said has faced an \"explosion in fly-by-night operators\" since it was created in 2021. State officials flagged similar concerns about the program earlier this year, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported.",
      "Thompson said Thursday that instead of giving day-to-day help to clients, some providers \"simply obtained apartments or condos \u2026 and then just put them in there and started billing,\" sometimes to the tune of hundreds of dollars a day.",
      "Scandal started with Feeding Our Future fraud case",
      "The largest known COVID-era fraud scheme \u2014 and the first one to fall into the federal government's crosshairs \u2014 targeted programs that offered food to needy children.",
      "The Minnesota-based nonprofit Feeding Our Future was accused of stealing from the Federal Child Nutrition Program by falsely claiming to distribute millions of meals during the pandemic. More than 75 people have been charged; at least 56 have pleaded guilty and seven have been convicted, including the group's leader. Prosecutors have put the losses at almost $250 million.",
      "Here's how prosecutors allege\u00a0it worked: Feeding Our Future recruited hundreds of local groups and businesses to run distribution sites and submitted reimbursement claims for the meals. The Minnesota Department of Education then paid out the claims using federal dollars. But many of those claims were falsified, with phony invoices and attendance rosters filled with fake children's names.",
      "Feeding Our Future collected millions in administrative fees and raked in kickbacks from the operators of its local sites, according to an indictment against founder Aimee Bock, who was convicted this year of wire fraud and several other charges. Dozens of site operators who worked with Feeding Our Future or other sponsors have also been charged, many of whom have been convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Bock has long denied any wrongdoing. Her attorney has said she plans to appeal.",
      "Some of the defendants who ran distribution sites spent the taxpayer money on lavish personal expenses like lakefront property, luxury cars, jewelry, first-class plane tickets and a rented private villa in the Maldives, according to documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "The scheme was part of a wave of pandemic fraud nationwide. Prosecutors say the Feeding Our Future defendants took advantage of a COVID-era expansion of the child nutrition program.",
      "State auditors have faulted the Minnesota Department of Education for its handling of the situation, too. Minnesota's Office of Legislative Auditor said last year the state agency \"created opportunities for fraud\" by missing warning signs and failing to address complaints.",
      "The report also claimed the agency was stymied by Feeding Our Future's history of accusing the state of racial discrimination when officials started taking a closer look at the group. The organization's founder is White, but most of those charged in the scheme are of Somali descent, and the group said in a 2020 lawsuit against the state that it primarily served minority communities.",
      "State officials spotted early signs of fraud before the COVID-19 pandemic began, but faced pressure from Feeding Our Future to stop asking questions, CBS News previously reported. An attorney for Bock denied that she pressured state officials.",
      "Trump weighs in \u2014 and links it to Somalia",
      "Mr. Trump has ripped Minnesota over the controversy, calling the state a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" and claiming Somali immigrants have \"ripped off that state.\"",
      "He has lashed out at Somali people in often-incendiary terms, calling them \"garbage\" and claiming they \"contribute nothing.\" Frequent targets of his ire include Walz and Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and came to the U.S. as a teenager.",
      "Walz and Omar, in turn, have denounced the president for his rhetoric, which the governor called \"vile, racist lies and slander towards our fellow Minnesotans.\"",
      "Roughly 76,000 people of Somali descent lived in Minnesota last year, 52% of whom were born in the U.S. and 42% of whom were naturalized citizens, according to Census Bureau data.",
      "Immigration authorities launched a crackdown in early December in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, and Mr. Trump has said he will revoke deportation protections for potentially hundreds of Somali migrants in Minnesota.",
      "The fraud scandal itself has also drawn attention from the Trump administration. The U.S. Treasury says it is investigating whether Minnesota tax money went to the Somali terror group al Shabaab, following allegations in the conservative magazine City Journal. But multiple federal investigators told CBS News Minnesota's Jonah Kaplan that there is no evidence taxpayer dollars were funneled to al Shabaab.",
      "\"The vast majority of the money that these folks made went to spending on luxury items for themselves,\" said Andy Luger, the former U.S. attorney who led the office which prosecuted these frauds from 2022 until January. \"There was never any evidence that this money went to fund terrorism nor was there any evidence that was the intent of the 70 people we indicted.\"",
      "A 2019 report by the state's Office of the Legislative Auditor said it was \"unable to substantiate\" allegations that funding from one program was going to terrorist groups, though the report didn't rule it out, saying it's \"possible\" that state funds may have found their way to terrorists.",
      "Walz's handling of fraud scandal under scrutiny",
      "Republicans at the state and national level have criticized Walz for years, accusing him and other state officials of being slow to act on warning signs of fraud. Walz has led Minnesota since 2019, but he gained national prominence after serving as the Democratic nominee for vice president last year.",
      "Earlier this month, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into alleged fraud in Minnesota state programs, requesting documents from Walz.",
      "Walz has long defended the state's handling of the situation. He said in 2022 that officials caught the Feeding Our Future scheme early on, but couldn't take further action due to an order from a judge and a request from the FBI not to do anything that could harm its investigation.",
      "The governor said last week that he will \"take responsibility\" for the mistakes that led to theft of taxpayer dollars. But he added that the \"guardrails were taken off\" by the federal government during the pandemic, and \"the guidance was to move the money.\"",
      "Walz launched a new fraud prevention program on Dec. 12, led by a former FBI agent. He applauded the new federal charges on Thursday.",
      "\"This is exactly the type of strong action we need from prosecutors to ensure fraudsters are put behind bars,\" Walz said in a statement. \"We will not tolerate fraud, and we will continue to work with federal partners to ensure fraud is stopped and fraudsters are caught.\"",
      "James Clark, inspector general of the Minnesota Department of Human Services, said in a statement Thursday the agency \"has been moving more aggressively than ever to suspend payments where we see evidence of fraud.\" He also urged federal officials to share information with the agency, which oversees many of the programs that were hit by fraud allegations.",
      "\"If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses,\" Clark said.",
      "Michael  Kaplan and \n                                                  \n                                  Jonah  Kaplan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ex-special-counsel-jack-smith-lawyers-call-for-him-to-testify-publicly/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 10:37:31 -0500",
    "summary": "Jack Smith, who oversaw two investigations into President Trump, appeared before the House Judiciary Committee for a closed-door deposition Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for former special counsel Jack Smith reiterated their call for Smith to appear publicly before lawmakers to answer questions about his investigations into President Trump after he testified privately earlier in the week.",
      "Smith appeared before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday for a closed-door deposition and answered questions for roughly nine hours, his lawyers, Lanny Breuer and Peter Koski, said in a letter to the panel's chairman, Jim Jordan, that was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"Mr. Smith welcomed this opportunity and hopes that it will serve to correct the many mischaracterizations about the work of the Special Counsel's Office,\" they wrote in the letter, dated Thursday.",
      "Breuer and Koski urged Jordan, an Ohio Republican, to promptly release the full videotape of the deposition and said \"doing so will ensure that the American people can hear the facts directly from Mr. Smith, rather than through second-hand accounts.\" Koski and Breuer also reiterated their request for Smith to address lawmakers in an \"open and public hearing.\"",
      "\"During the investigation of President Trump, Mr. Smith steadfastly followed Justice Department policies, observed all legal requirements, and took actions based on the facts and the law. He stands by his decisions,\" they wrote to Jordan.",
      "Politico first reported the letter from Smith's lawyers to Jordan. Two former special counsels, Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have each testified in open forums about their respective investigations. Mueller\u00a0examined Russian interference\u00a0in the 2016 election, and Hur\u00a0probed former President Joe Biden's handling\u00a0of sensitive government documents.",
      "Smith was tapped as special counsel during the Biden administration to take over the Justice Department's investigations into Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents and his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election. Mr. Trump faced a total of more than 40 charges in both of those cases, though they ended after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Now, with Republicans in control of Congress, they have begun investigating the prosecutions. Smith had offered in October to voluntarily answer questions in an open hearing before the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, but Jordan issued a subpoena to the former special counsel demanding Smith's testimony at a closed-door deposition.",
      "In his opening statement to lawmakers, which was obtained by CBS News, Smith defended the prosecutions of Mr. TRump and said he made decisions \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "He said his investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to hold onto power after the 2020 election developed \"proof beyond a reasonable doubt\" that the president engaged in a scheme to overturn the results of the last presidential contest. As to the case involving the president's handling of documents marked classified, Smith told lawmakers that his investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Smith also defended investigative steps taken by his team, which included obtaining phone records of nine sitting GOP members of Congress as part of his probe related to the 2020 election. The data was for several days during the week of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Mr. Trump's supporters breached the U.S. Capitol building in an effort to keep Congress from certifying the election results.",
      "The former special counsel said the records were \"lawfully subpoenaed\" and relevant to his investigation.",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith told the Judiciary Committee. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "On his first day back in the White House, the president issued sweeping pardons to roughly 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 attack.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate confirmed Admiral Kevin Lunday as Coast Guard commandant Thursday night after agency guidance on the display of hate symbols such as swastikas and nooses was clarified. Democrats objecting to the guidance had been holding up the confirmation.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, called for and got senators to approve Lunday unanimously in remarks before the chamber adjourned for the year.",
      "After references to the hate symbols as \"potentially divisive\" were removed from Coast Guard policy, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen of Nevada said she was lifting a hold she'd placed on Lunday's nomination for the agency's top job.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, whose agency oversees the Coast Guard, said on social media that the latest changes were made so no one can \"misrepresent\" the branch's position.",
      "\"The pages of superseded and outdated policy will be completely removed from the record so no press outlet, entity or elected official may misrepresent the Coast Guard to politicize their policies and lie about their position on divisive and hate symbols,\" Noem said.",
      "The move capped back-and-forth revisions of the Coast Guard policy on swastikas, nooses and other hate symbols that had sparked an uproar. The Department of Homeland Security has asserted there \"was never a 'downgrade'\" in policy language.",
      "Rosen had said she was holding up Lunday's nomination because leadership appeared to have \"backtracked\" on a commitment that swastikas and nooses are considered hate symbols and prohibited from display.",
      "Rosen said Thursday on social media that she was lifting the hold and looked forward to working with Lunday to continue strengthening anti-harassment policies at the Coast Guard.",
      "\"While I continue to have reservations about the process by which this happened and the confusion created by leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, I am pleased to see that the policy now directly refers to stronger language against swastikas and nooses,\" she said.",
      "Noem called the delay of Lunday's nomination a \"politicized holdup,\" saying it had gone on long enough and he should be confirmed without delay.",
      "\"He has given nearly 39 years of distinguished service to the Coast Guard, this country, and the American people,\" she said.",
      "The Coast Guard's planned policy change calling hate symbols \"potentially divisive\" emerged publicly last month. It stopped short of banning them, instead saying that commanders could take steps to remove them from public view and that the rule did not apply to private spaces, such as family housing.",
      "DHS has said the change \"strengthens our ability to report, investigate, and prosecute those who violate longstanding policy.\"",
      "The Coast Guard said on social media that it \"maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward hate symbols, extremist ideology, and any conduct that undermines our core values. We prohibit the display or promotion of hate symbols in any form. Any suggestion otherwise is false.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-vaccine-memo-uproar/",
    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 05:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "A memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad\u200b, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, may signal an effort to to rewrite the rules governing the U.S. vaccine system.",
    "story": [
      "Six days after a senior FDA official sent a sweeping internal email claiming that COVID vaccines had caused the deaths of \"at least 10 children,\" 12 former FDA commissioners released an extraordinary warning in the Dec. 3 New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "They wrote that the claims and policy changes in the memo from Dr. Vinay Prasad, the head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, pose \"a threat to evidence-based vaccine policy and public health security\" and break sharply from long-standing scientific norms.",
      "What is unfolding inside the Food and Drug Administration is not a narrow dispute over COVID vaccines. It is an attempt, according to critics and vaccine scientists, to rewrite the rules governing the entire U.S. vaccine system \u2014 how risks are weighed, how benefits are proved, and how quickly lifesaving shots reach the public. Former agency leaders warn that if these changes take hold, the consequences could be lasting: fewer vaccines, slower updates, weakened public trust, and more preventable outbreaks.",
      "Prasad made clear he sees the moment as corrective. \"Never again will the US FDA commissioner have to himself find deaths in children for staff to identify it,\" he wrote, telling employees the agency's mission, and its \"worldview,\" would change.",
      "Prasad's email reopened old arguments about COVID vaccines, using what is generally considered weak and misleading science in the peer-reviewed research community. He claimed that FDA staff had found \"at least 10\" deaths in children that happened \"after and because of\" COVID vaccination, using reports from the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.",
      "The VAERS system is notoriously crowdsourced, meaning anyone can contribute, and scientists say it serves only as a clearinghouse for reports. For example, a person could file a report saying that after getting a flu shot, their hair turned purple. Though that report would remain in the database until it was reviewed, it cannot prove the cause of medical events. But Prasad argued that the true number of deaths was likely higher because many cases go unreported.",
      "On Substack, Inside Medicine reported Dec. 11 that Prasad used incomplete information and that a Dec. 5 internal FDA memo set the pediatric death toll from COVID shots somewhere between zero and seven. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard wrote, \"The FDA's investigation into deaths caused by Covid vaccines is still ongoing and there's no final count yet of those deaths.\"",
      "Prasad also accused the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of downplaying the risk of heart inflammation, called myocarditis, in young men; criticized the agency for approving shots for teenagers; and suggested that school and workplace vaccine mandates may have \"harmed more children than we saved,\" adding that \"we do not know if we saved lives on balance.\"",
      "By comparison, more than 2,100 American children died of COVID itself since the pandemic began, the CDC reported.",
      "Based on his erroneous and misleading claims about COVID vaccines, Prasad proposed a major overhaul of how vaccines are approved. He said the FDA should stop relying on immune markers to establish the efficacy of shots, such as antibody levels, and instead require large placebo-controlled randomized trials that track hospitalizations and deaths before approving most new vaccines.",
      "Many immunologists and vaccine experts say it's unethical to test vaccines known to be effective against disease with a control group that would receive a placebo, exposing them to infection.",
      "\"There is a rock-solid principle in bioethics that it is unethical to test any drug or vaccine against a placebo if it is known to be safe and effective. The reason is that such placebo-controlled trials would effectively deny patients access to a vaccine that could prevent a dangerous infectious disease,\" said Dr. Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.",
      "Prasad called the current flu vaccine system an \"evidence-based catastrophe,\" questioned the approval of vaccines for pregnant women based on immune response alone, and raised concerns about giving multiple vaccines at once. He told staff to rewrite FDA guidelines to match his new \"worldview\" and said anyone who disagreed with his \"core principles\" should resign.",
      "The former FDA leaders expressed alarm in the NEJM article. They said Prasad is exploiting public frustration over the federal response to COVID to spark doubt about the entire childhood vaccine system, which could undo decades of success in protecting children from deadly diseases.",
      "\"This is really different. And it's really dangerous. And people will be hurt, particularly by the vaccine decisions,\" former FDA commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said in an interview. He also warned that Prasad's proposed policies \u2014 which he noted echo positions on vaccines held by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist \u2014 could shake the entire vaccine market.",
      "\"The goal of RFK seems to be to make it impossible for vaccines to be available in the U.S.,\" he said. If the proposals advance, he added,\"it won't be a viable business.\"",
      "Hilliard pushed back sharply on those concerns, writing: \"The American people deserve evidence-based science. Dr. Prasad's email lays out a philosophical framework that points us toward that higher standard. We will soon release documents laying out that framework and data confirming how the COVID vaccine resulted in children's deaths that previous leadership failed to properly investigate.\"",
      "For generations, the childhood vaccine program has depended on clear rules, strong safety systems, and public trust. Experts say Prasad's ideas, based on claims they argue are not supported by real evidence, could make it much harder to test, approve, and deliver vaccines to families.",
      "Fueling parental doubt",
      "Prasad's memo indicates he considers VAERS reports as proof that vaccines caused children's deaths. The system, though, is designed to be only an \"early warning system\" for potential safety issues with vaccines that can be investigated further.",
      "\"VAERS signals should never be taken as proof of true vaccine risks without careful, confirmatory studies,\" said Dr. Katherine Yih, an epidemiologist and longtime investigator with the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a CDC program.",
      "Doing so, scientists say, directly feeds public fear at a time when many parents are already unsure whom to trust.",
      "\"Causation requires converging evidence, not just one report or coincidence,\" said Dr. Robert Hopkins, medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.",
      "Prasad's framework, however, treats uncertainty as a reason to halt development entirely.",
      "Experts fear this doubt won't stay limited to COVID vaccines. Once parents start to question the FDA's honesty, they may begin doubting long-standing vaccines for measles, polio, or whooping cough \u2014 shots that have protected children for decades.",
      "\"Science must be transparent,\" Gostin said. If families believe the FDA is misusing data or silencing experts, confidence in the entire vaccine system can collapse, he said. \"There's a public narrative that people have lost trust in science, but that's not true. The vast majority want the FDA to make decisions based on the best scientific evidence. Once they believe that the agency is marginalizing scientists and cherry-picking evidence, their trust will plummet.\"",
      "Delicate vaccine pipeline",
      "Prasad's new framework will likely make it far harder for companies to produce or update vaccines. The 12 former FDA commissioners warned that requiring clinical trials for all new or updated shots would slow vaccine improvements and leave people unprotected. His plan, they wrote, \"would impede the ability to update vaccines in a timely fashion, especially for respiratory viruses.\"",
      "For fast-changing viruses like flu and COVID, this could be disastrous. There's simply not enough time to run full clinical trials every time a virus mutates.",
      "There are also major business effects. Vaccine development is costly, and companies may decide the U.S. is no longer worth the risk. If companies slow down or leave the market, families could face shortages, fewer innovations, and fewer protections for their kids.",
      "Rising fear, falling standards, and under strain",
      "Science depends on open and public debate. Prasad's memo warned his employees against it. In addition to demanding that FDA staff members who disagree with him resign, he said their disputes should stay private and called leaks \"unethical\" and \"illegal.\"",
      "Susan Ellenberg, a former director of the FDA's Office of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, warned that Prasad risks destroying the process that makes science credible. \"If disagreement is treated as disloyalty, you lose the only mechanism that keeps science honest,\" she said.",
      "Without strong internal debate, safety reviews become weaker. \"You lose the checks and balances that make vaccine safety science credible,\" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who served on the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Network during the COVID pandemic.",

      "The U.S. government has expanded a sweeping pause on legal immigration applications to include those filed by people from an additional 20 countries that President Trump added to his \"travel ban\" proclamation this week, a U.S. official with direct knowledge told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "The move, which mainly affects immigrants who hail from certain African and Asian countries, further escalates a wide-ranging crackdown on legal immigration expanded by the Trump administration this month. Many of those affected by the pause are likely to be legal immigrants who are currently in the U.S. and are seeking to change their status or become citizens.",
      "Earlier in December, the Trump administration directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to completely freeze all immigration petitions \u2014 including requests for American citizenship and permanent residency \u2014 made by those already in the U.S. who are nationals of the 19 countries he banned or restricted travel from in June. That order is colloquially known as the \"travel ban.\"",
      "It was one of several immigration restrictions the administration announced in the wake of the Thanksgiving week shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., an attack allegedly carried out by an Afghan national. The administration also suspended all decisions for asylum cases handled by USCIS and the processing of all immigration and visa requests by Afghans.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump expanded that \"travel ban\" proclamation to include 20 additional nations, fully barring immigrants and travelers from 5 new countries and partially restricting the entry of people from another 15 nations.",
      "A U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal changes that have not been formally announced told CBS News on Thursday that USCIS has expanded its suspension of immigration cases to include the new nationalities added to Mr. Trump's proclamation on Tuesday.",
      "The pause will now affect nationals of Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria, the new countries facing full travel bans. It will also impact those hailing from Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The last set of countries face partial restrictions under the latest proclamation.",
      "Previously, the suspension of immigration cases applied to nationals of Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Laos, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Yemen and Venezuela. In his latest proclamation, Mr. Trump imposed a full entry ban on citizens of Laos and Sierra Leone, which previously faced partial restrictions.",
      "In a statement posed on social media late Thursday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow appeared to reference the expansion.",
      "\"USCIS is conducting a comprehensive review of anyone from anywhere who poses a threat to the U.S., including those identified in the President's latest proclamation to restore law and order in our nation's immigration system,\" Edlow wrote.",
      "Taken together, Mr. Trump's latest \"travel ban\" decree affects nationals of over 60% of the countries in Africa and roughly 20% of all nations across the globe.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued the broad restrictions are designed to safeguard national security and address concerns about the ability to vet people from the affected nations.

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 11:00:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Justice Department is suing more than a dozen landlords on allegations of sexual harassment, a problem one top department official called \"traumatic for the victims\" and \"inappropriate and illegal.\"",
    "story": [
      "In a crowded neighborhood of duplexes, small apartments and one-story bungalows near a liquor store and pizza shop, William Asper serves as a landlord for nearly two dozen properties.",
      "The Detroit suburb of Westland, Michigan, 10 minutes north of the Detroit Metropolitan Airport, is where Asper helps manage some weathered rental properties, many of which were built in the early 1970s and are more affordable to low-income families in this working-class region, according to federal records published by the Justice Department.",
      "Amid surging housing costs, rent in the neighborhood is more affordable, including for families who use federal subsidies and have no other options for housing.",
      "The Justice Department has alleged Asper tried to take advantage of the needs of his tenants, leveraging his position to seek sexual favors. The agency said Asper threatened to withhold repairs or evict tenants who did not comply.",
      "In a court filing in Michigan earlier this month, the Justice Department alleged Asper told one tenant in 2019 \"that there were 'different ways' she could pay rent.\" The government's attorneys also said he \"touched the tenant without her consent, regularly pulling her hair, grabbing her buttocks and kissing her head.\" And they alleged he \"regularly pulled his penis out of his pants in front of the tenant while at her home, often times while her young son was in the room.\"",
      "In their court documents, Justice Department lawyers also alleged that in 2018, Asper told a \"female tenant that he was lonely, wanted someone to spend time with him, and asked if she would go to a hotel with him. Asper allegedly \"told the female tenant that if she did not engage in sexual relations with him, he would give her a 24-hour eviction notice.\"",
      "The allegations appeared in a civil lawsuit filed by the Justice Department against Asper, arguing he violated the federal Fair Housing Act. His civil case is pending in the Eastern District of Michigan federal court, and his formal response to the allegations has not yet been posted.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Asper said the accusations are false.",
      "\"I offer low-income housing and people want to blame the landlord or make excuses why they couldn't pay the rent,\" Asper said. \"These women wanted to do more/be my 'girlfriend', side chick and that was not going to happen.\"",
      "Asper isn't the only landlord facing such claims. It is one of at least 52 federal civil lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and misconduct against landlords since 2017.",
      "\"It's traumatic for the victims,\" said Harmeet Dhillon, the assistant U.S. attorney general for civil rights. \"People may not believe them. And they may have been the victim multiple times.\"",
      "The Justice Department's Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which seeks to combat these types of cases, was launched in the first year of the first Trump administration in 2017. Dhillon's team continues to pursue the cases. Several former Justice Department attorneys, including appointees of both the Biden and Trump Administrations, have lauded the program and its work since 2017.",
      "There are 14 federal sexual harassment civil cases pending across the United States, including Asper's case in Michigan.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Dhillon said the filings of these suits can serve as a deterrent to future harassment and abuse. She said the legal challenges \"made all the women in that property feel like they've been seen and heard.\"",
      "Dhillon said the Fair Housing Act, which passed in 1968 amid the sweeping changes of the Civil Rights era, prohibits any kind of quid pro quo involving sex, sexual acts or sexual harassment, either for renting, continuing to rent or obtaining repairs.",
      "\"Every American deserves to feel safe and know this sexual harassment is inappropriate and illegal,\" Dhillon said.",
      "A CBS News review of some of the dozens of recently filed Justice Department cases shows parallels to the accusations against Asper.",
      "In a separate legal challenge filed against a central New York landlord in 2018, the Justice Department alleged the harassment spanned three decades. The Oswego man is accused of \"Demanding that female tenants engage in, or pressuring them to engage in, sexual intercourse, oral sex, or other sexual acts with him in order to obtain or keep rental housing.\"",
      "In a 2017 Justice Department complaint filed in federal court in Kansas, a Wichita-area landlord is accused of entering a female tenant's apartment \"unannounced\" and \"touching her body while she slept in her bed.\" The landlord is also accused of \"Conditioning tangible housing benefits, including forgiving or reducing rent, on engaging in sexual conduct.\"",
      "And in a legal challenge initially filed in Minnesota in 2020, the feds alleged a landlord offered to overlook or excuse unpaid rent and utilities in exchange for sex acts. The landlord was also accused of \"Expressing a preference for renting to single female tenants.\"",
      "The legal challenges filed by the Justice Department can help secure civil penalties against landlords and damages for victims. A CBS News review of Justice Department records showed the agency has recovered approximately $1.5 million since January.",
      "And in the New York, Kansas and Minnesota cases, the Justice Department struck written agreements with the landlords that, among other things, required them to hire independent property managers so they would no longer need to come into contact with tenants themselves.",
      "A spokesperson for the National Fair Housing Alliance, a civil rights group that advocates for tenants and combats discrimination, said instances of sexual harassment by landlords are likely more pervasive than current statistics indicate.",
      "\"Sexual harassment in housing is one of the most underreported instances of housing discrimination, given that the victims often fear facing retaliation or eviction if they file a complaint,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which handles Fair Housing Act sex harassment probes, has experienced a purge of veteran employees this year, amid a Trump-ordered downsizing of the federal government \u2014 led by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 and the Trump Administration's dramatic shifts in some of the office's priorities.",
      "Justice Connection, a newly formed organization that supports ousted or resigning Justice Department prosecutors, estimated nearly 75% of career attorneys in the division have departed this year.",
      "Dhillon said the unit that handles the housing cases has been less impacted by the changes and cuts. She told CBS News, \"I don't think we're losing people in that section, and people are pretty happy with the type of work we're doing.\" Dhillon said the Civil Rights section has hired approximately 50 people this year, amid the larger turnover in the agency.",
      "Some tenants have filed their own individual federal civil lawsuits alleging sex harassment in violation of the Fair Housing Act.",
      "In one case, an Alabama woman filed a complaint in federal court alleging a series of personal harms. Her suit alleged \"emotional distress, including humiliation and mental anguish\" from a landlord who \"offered to reduce her rent in exchange for sex.\" The lawsuit alleged: \"When [she] refused his sexual advances, he raised her rent.\"",
      "Housing advocates said low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to harassment, under fear that they could lose their housing if they reject a landlord's unlawful advances.",
      "The Justice Department's posted guidance on its protections of the Fair Housing Act says that \"women, particularly those who are poor, and with limited housing options, often have little recourse but to tolerate the humiliation and degradation of sexual harassment or risk having their families and themselves removed from their homes. The Department's enforcement program is aimed at landlords who create an untenable living environment by demanding sexual favors from tenants or by creating a sexually hostile environment for them.\"",
      "The National Fair Housing Alliance spokesperson told CBS News: \"Each investigation\u2014and especially every resolution\u2014sends a clear message that this egregious conduct, which targets the most vulnerable, will not be tolerated. Home should be a safe place, and these actions ensure that promise is upheld.\"",
      "Justice Connection, an organization of former Justice Department employees, told CBS News it estimates the agency's housing unit has lost nearly half of its staff this year.",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "The comet will come much closer to Jupiter in March, zipping within 33 million miles. It will be the mid-2030s before it reaches interstellar space, never to return, said Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies.",
      "It's the third known interstellar object to cut through our solar system. Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas originate in star systems elsewhere in the Milky Way, while home-grown comets like Halley's hail from the icy fringes of our solar system.",

    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

      "Isaacman, a 42-year-old businessman, made his fortune in online payment processing and has a personal passion for space. He paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount in February 2021 to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight \u2014 the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission.

      "During his second confirmation hearing in December, Isaacman pledged he would ensure the success of the Artemis lunar exploration program that began in 2017, during the first Trump administration.",
      "\"America will return to the moon before our great rival, and we will establish an enduring presence to understand and realize the scientific, economic and national security value on the lunar surface,\" Isaacman said.",
      "He also stressed the need to beat China in the space race, saying, \"We are in a great competition with a rival that has the will and means to challenge American exceptionalism across multiple domains, including in the high ground of space.\"",
      "NASA's Artemis program, however, has faced numerous delays, and experts warned in September that the lunar lander developed by Elon Musk's SpaceX might not be ready in time.",

      "A stray comet from another star swings past Earth this week in one last hurrah before racing back toward interstellar space.",
      "Discovered over the summer, the comet known as 3I/Atlas will pass within 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) of our planet on Friday, the closest it gets on its grand tour of the solar system.",
      "NASA continues to aim its space telescopes at the visiting ice ball, estimated to be between 1,444 feet and 3.5 miles in size. But it's fading as it exits, so now's the time for backyard astronomers to catch it in the night sky with their telescopes.",
      "The comet will come much closer to Jupiter in March, zipping within 33 million miles. It will be the mid-2030s before it reaches interstellar space, never to return, said Paul Chodas, director of NASA's Center for Near Earth Object Studies.",
      "It's the third known interstellar object to cut through our solar system. Interstellar comets like 3I/Atlas originate in star systems elsewhere in the Milky Way, while home-grown comets like Halley's hail from the icy fringes of our solar system.",
      "A telescope in Hawaii discovered the first confirmed interstellar visitor in 2017. Two years later, an interstellar comet was spotted by a Crimean amateur astronomer. NASA's sky-surveying Atlas telescope in Chile spotted comet 3I/Atlas in July while prowling for potentially dangerous asteroids.",
      "Scientists believe the latest interloping comet, also harmless, may have originated in a star system much older than ours, making it a tantalizing target.",
      "NASA has released several images of 3I/Atlas, including one last month showing it move through space about 180 million miles from Earth.",
      "In October, images taken by two Mars orbiters showed a bright, fuzzy white dot of the comet, appearing to move against a backdrop of distant stars as it was about 18,641,135 miles away from Mars.",
      "In September, an\u00a0image showed the growing tail\u00a0of 3I/ATLAS streaking across our solar system.",
      "Harvard scientist Ari Loeb, who believes he's seen\u00a0proof of alien life\u00a0before, said he suspected the object may instead have alien origins.",
      "\"We should put all possibilities on the table that it's a rock, a comet, or something else until we get the evidence, the data that will tell us what it is,\"\u00a0Loeb said in an interview\u00a0with CBS Boston.",

    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",
      "\"My encouragement would be for everyone to play around with AI and not assume there is one specific way you should be interacting with [AI],\" he said. \"Interact in a variety of ways because you'll get different answers.\"",

      "DraftKings said event contracts will be available for trading in 38 states and that the company will eventually expand beyond sports and finance into other markets, such as entertainment and culture. The sports betting company announced Friday it is debuting DraftKings Predictions, a mobile app and web product that will be regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.",
      "\"Along with our operational footprint, marketing and analytics infrastructure and advanced in-house technology, we believe we are uniquely positioned to lead this space over the long term,\" Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer of DraftKings, said in a statement.",

      "More specifically, users originate the trades, while DraftKings acts as a broker, Jeanine Hightower-Sellitto, the general manager of DraftKings Predictions, told CBS News.",
      "\"We're handling that order and it's getting sent to an exchange for it to be executed,\" she explained.",
      "DraftKings faces growing competition from prediction markets \u2014 including Kalshi and Polymarket, now valued at $9 billion and $11 billion, respectively \u2014 that enable users to speculate on the outcome of sports and other events.",
      "In October, DraftKings\u00a0announced\u00a0the acquisition of Railbird Technologies, a federally regulated prediction market. At the time, DraftKings said the deal supports its \"broader strategy to enter prediction markets.\"",
      "Some prediction market platforms lacking a license for sports wagering have faced pushback from state regulators. Event contracts traded on markets are regulated differently from sports bets, which are illegal in certain states.",
      "Others have criticized the move by prediction markets to facilitate speculation on sports. Charlie Baker, the president of the NCAA, recently called out Kalshi on\u00a0social media\u00a0after the company filed forms to accept bets on the transfer decisions and status of student-athletes, saying it would threaten \"competition integrity and recruiting processes.\"",

      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",

    "summary": "iRobot, which introduced the Roomba vacuum cleaner in 2002, vows to continue supporting its products despite Chapter 11 filing.",
    "story": [
      "Roomba maker iRobot filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sunday and said the robotic vacuum cleaner would sell itself to a Chinese contract manufacturer.",
      "Shenzhen PICEA Robotics Co., which makes Roombas for Bedford, Massachusetts-based iRobot, will buy the company, according to a news release. iRobot said it doesn't expect any disruptions to its app, customer service or other functions.",
      "Founded in 1990 by MIT roboticists, iRobot initially designed robots for space exploration, according to the company. iRobot debuted the Roomba in 2002, billing it as the first robotic vacuum for household floors. As sales grew, the company went public in 2005, and its stock price once topped $125.",
      "Shares of iRobot fell $3.12, or 72%, to $1.20 in pre-market trading on Monday.",
      "Amazon agreed to buy iRobot for $1.7 billion in 2022, but the deal\u00a0fell apart last year after pushback from European Union regulators. At that time, Amazon said it would pay iRobot an agreed-upon termination fee of $94 million, while the vacuum maker planned to restructure to help stabilize the business.",
      "In September, iRobot warned that it was struggling with declining sales as consumers cut spending, warning\u00a0that it was at risk of either shutting down some operations or filing for bankruptcy.",
      "Under the deal with Picea, iRobot said it will continue to operate \"in the ordinary course with no anticipated disruption to its app functionality, customer programs, global partners, supply chain relationships or ongoing product support.\"",

      "It was unclear why the files are missing. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment.",
      "In a social media post to its X account Saturday night that seemed to touch on the issue, the DOJ wrote: \"Photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.\"",
      "One of the missing files showed a mass of framed photos on a credenza desk. The photos showed former President Bill Clinton, and another was of the pope. In an open drawer, there was a photo of President Trump, Epstein, and Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Other missing files included photos of a room with what appeared to be a massage table and nude photos and nude paintings.",
      "The episode has deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department's much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein's crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.",
      "Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.",
      "Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions \u2014 records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.",
      "The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain's former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability",
      "Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department's decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children.",
      "The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein's homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.",
      "There was a series of never-before-seen photos of Clinton but fleetingly few of Mr. Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.",
      "Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/blue-origin-sub-orbital-space-trip-wheelchair-user-michaela-benthaus/",
    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:21:27 -0500",
    "summary": "German engineer Michaela Benthaus is the first person with a significant physical handicap to reach space.",
    "story": [
      "In a space-age milestone, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched a wheelchair-using engineer and handicap advocate to the edge of space Saturday, a 10-minute trip that allowed her to enjoy a few minutes of weightlessness more than 65 miles above Earth.",
      "Michaela Benthaus, a German aerospace engineer who suffered a spinal cord injury in a 2018 mountain biking accident, joined a retired SpaceX manager and four entrepreneurs for the up-and-down flight to a point just above the so-called \"boundary\" of space.",
      "\"It was the coolest experience!\" she said after landing, joking about turning upside down in weightlessness. \"I didn't only like the view and the microgravity, but I also liked the going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up.\"",
      "Benthaus was assisted during training and inside the Blue Origin capsule by Hans Koenigsmann, a former SpaceX manager and engineer who was instrumental in the development of that company's workhorse Falcon family of rockets.",
      "A fellow German by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen, Koenigsmann helped arrange Benthaus' flight after meeting her last year.",
      "\"I met Hans the first time online,\" Benthaus said in a Blue Origin interview. \"I just asked him, like, you know, you worked for so long for SpaceX, do you think that people like me can be astronauts?",
      "\"Then he reached out to Blue Origin and told me oh, Blue actually is very excited about it. Okay, I have my doubts on it, but let's see. Thankfully it turned out we can do it. So Hans and me (ended) up flying as a team,\" Benthaus continued.",
      "Koenigsmann said Benthaus \"basically inspired me to do this. It's her drive that kind of convinced me I should do that, too, and to just experience something that I've seen from the outside for a long time.\"",
      "Benthaus was able to make her own way from her wheelchair into the New Shepard capsule before launch, scooting along a bench extending from the hatch that was provided by Blue Origin. Koenigsmann was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed.",
      "Running two days late because of last-minute technical issues, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero Saturday and the New Shepard blasted off from Blue Origin's West Texas launch pad at 9:15 a.m. EST.",
      "Accelerating straight up into a mostly clear sky, the capsule's single-stage booster reached a velocity of nearly three times the speed of sound before its hydrogen-fueled BE-3 engine shut down about two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff.",
      "At that point, the New Shepard capsule was released to continue coasting upward on its own, and the crew, now weightless, was free to briefly unstrap and float about the cabin.",
      "Benthaus' legs were strapped together to keep them in place, but she, too, was free to enjoy the thrill of weightlessness as the New Shepard coasted up to a peak altitude of slightly more than 65 miles, well above the 62-mile-high point where aerodynamic forces no longer have any effect.",
      "At that altitude, the \"sky\" is deep black and Earth's horizon is sharply curved. Passengers are able to take in the view through the largest windows ever flown in space.",
      "\"Oh, my God,\" one passenger could be heard exclaiming over the capsule's radio.",
      "\"Incredible,\" another said.",
      "Falling back into the lower atmosphere, the crew was warned to get back in their seats to strap in before the onset of atmospheric deceleration. Maximum deceleration subjects New Shepard crews to about five times the normal pull of gravity.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, followed a similar trajectory, falling tail first back toward the launch site. Nearing the ground, the BE-3 engine re-ignited, landing legs deployed and the rocket settled to an on-target touchdown on a concrete pad near the launch gantry.",
      "The New Shepard came down under three large parachutes, landing in a cloud of dust near the booster and its launch pad. Blue Origin support personnel quickly reached the spacecraft to help the crew exit.",
      "Joining Benthaus and Koenigsmann aboard the New Shepard were physicist-investor Joey Hyde, entrepreneur Neal Milch, adventurer Jason Stansell and Adonis Pouroulis, a South African entrepreneur and mining engineer.",
      "All six waved, smiling broadly as they climbed out of the capsule one at a time. Benthaus was last out, carried from the spacecraft by Koenigsmann and a member of Blue Origin's recovery team to a nearby wheelchair.",
      "\"You should never give up on your dreams, right?,\" she said after landing. \"I just feel very lucky, and I'm very grateful to Blue and Hans and everyone who said yes to this journey.\"",
      "Blue Origin does not publicly disclose the cost of a New Shepard seat, but the price is thought to be upwards of $500,000 each. How Benthaus' seat was financed was not revealed.",
      "Saturday's launch marked Blue Origin's 16th New Shepard flight with passengers aboard since Bezos, his brother and two others blasted off on the first such flight in July 2021. Including Saturday's flight, Blue Origin has now launched 92 men and women to space, including six who have flown twice.",
      "While Benthaus was the first person with a significant physical handicap to fly in space, European Space Agency astronaut John McFall, who has a prosthetic leg, has been cleared for selection to a future flight to the International Space Station.",
      "Benthaus said before launch the reaction to her flight aboard the New Shepard was mostly positive, saying she hopes more handicapped people might make their way to space.",
      "The big question for NASA and other space agencies and private companies is not so much whether handicapped astronauts can carry out their duties in the weightless environment of space. It's more about how they can handle an emergency that might require a speedy exit from their spacecraft, either on the ground or in space.",
      "In an interview with CNN, Benthaus said \"we're thinking more and more about long-duration space missions; some of us want to go to the Mars in the future.\"",
      "\"That's a very long journey. And, yes, people can get a disability on the way. People can have a stroke or break their leg or get a spinal cord injury.\"",
      "In the end, she said, \"people with disabilities actually bring value to a crew. ... You develop a very special resilience.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department released thousands of new records on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein on Friday, but at least 550 pages in the documents were fully redacted in the initial release, CBS News has found.",
      "The newly released files included photos of several prominent people in Epstein's orbit, images from his homes and investigative records that detail disturbing allegations against the late sex offender. But the heavy redactions in many of the records have drawn criticism from Democrats and some Republicans, as the department defends its handling of the files.",
      "One series of three consecutive documents \u2014 totaling 255 pages \u2014 is entirely redacted, with each page covered by a black box. A fourth 119-page document labeled \"Grand Jury-NY\" is also entirely redacted.",
      "At least 180 blacked-out pages appear in files that are mostly but not entirely redacted. In some cases, a cover page, a\u00a0photo of a folder\u00a0or\u00a0something else that isn't fully redacted\u00a0precedes several pages that are entirely obscured by a black box.",
      "The Justice Department released another tranche of files on Saturday, including a 119-page transcript from the grand jury proceedings involving Epstein's convicted co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell. A White House spokesperson shared a social media post that suggested the file was the unredacted version of Friday's blacked-out document of the same length.",
      "It's unclear if any other documents that were mostly or entirely redacted on Friday were released in an unredacted form Saturday. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for more details but did not immediately receive a response.",
      "In other cases, the redactions were more sparing. For example, a 96-page police report on a Florida investigation into Epstein in the mid-2000s redacts the names of victims and other details, but leaves many other details in. The 119-page grand jury transcript that was published Saturday takes out names and identifying information, but leaves in almost everything else.",
      "And some of the thousands of photos included in Friday's release are partially redacted, with some people's faces obscured by boxes. Photos that include former President Bill Clinton, pop star Michael Jackson and other notable people have partial redactions (though Clinton and Jackson themselves are fully visible).",
      "Why was the DOJ allowed to redact Epstein files?",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed by Congress last month, requires the Justice Department to release the files in its possession related to Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Redactions are allowed for a handful of reasons, including to protect survivors' personal information and to leave out violent photos and child sexual abuse material. Documents can also be withheld in a \"narrowly tailored and temporary\" manner if their release would \"jeopardize an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution.\"",
      "Some of Friday's redactions appear to black out the names of survivors, but it's not clear in every case why information was blacked out. The government is required to give Congress a list of redactions within 15 days.",
      "The law explicitly forbids the government from withholding records due to the risk of \"embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity.\" The Justice Department said on X that no politicians' names were redacted from the files.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said in a letter to Congress earlier Friday that a team of more than 200 Justice Department lawyers scoured the documents in search of survivors' names and other things that needed to be redacted. He said the department is still going through the files and will release more of them on a \"rolling basis,\" though the law required them to be released by Friday.",
      "Blanche's letter also said \"additional layers of review\" were necessary when reviewing grand jury transcripts. Judges in New York and Florida have given the government permission to release grand jury transcripts from Epstein's and Maxwell's cases, but the judge overseeing the Maxwell case required the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan to \"personally certify\" that none of the documents contain victims' personal information.",
      "Democrats criticize the redactions in Epstein files",
      "Some lawmakers have blasted the Justice Department for the redactions and for acknowledging that some documents will be released later.",
      "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who helped lead the effort to pass the Epstein Files Transparency Act, argued that Friday's document release wasn't in compliance with their law.",
      "Khanna called it an \"incomplete release with too many redactions\" in a video posted to X. He said he's \"exploring all options,\" including impeachment or referrals for prosecution. Massie said the release \"grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law.\"",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said: \"Simply releasing a mountain of blacked out pages violates the spirit of transparency and the letter of the law. For example, all 119 pages of one document were completely blacked out. We need answers as to why.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files. Blanche told Fox News Digital: \"The only redactions being applied to the documents are those required by law \u2014 full stop.\"",
      "\"Democrat administrations in the past have refused to provide full details of the Jeffrey Epstein saga,\" Blanche said in his letter to lawmakers. \"But President Trump, Attorney General Bondi, and FBI Director Patel are committed to providing full transparency consistent with the law.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 17:53:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik's decision to drop out came after President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement in the race at this stage.",
    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump on Saturday endorsed Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman for governor. Read the story here.",
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik dropped out of the New York governor's race Friday, concluding that a potentially fractious GOP primary could hurt Republicans' chances in an uphill statewide contest, as President Trump signaled he would not make an endorsement at this stage.",
      "Stefanik pointed to the risks in a statement to supporters, writing: \"While we would have overwhelmingly won this primary, it is not an effective use of our time or your generous resources to spend the first half of next year in an unnecessary and protracted Republican primary, especially in a challenging state like New York.\"",
      "Stefanik's political future is now unclear, as she said she is not planning to run for re-election in Congress. Stefanik, considered a rising MAGA leader, was initially set to leave Congress after Mr. Trump picked her in November 2024 for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, before her nomination was pulled by the administration in March over concerns about a narrowing Republican majority in the House.",
      "Two sources confirmed to CBS News that Stefanik spoke directly with President Trump on Thursday to discuss her decision to leave the gubernatorial race. Their conversation was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "Mr. Trump later issued a statement following her announcement applauding Stefanik, calling her \"a fantastic person and Congresswoman from New York State\" and describing her as \"a tremendous talent.\" He said she would have \"great success\" in whatever she chooses next and signaled his continued support.",
      "A Republican member of Congress with direct knowledge of the race told CBS News they believed Stefanik ultimately concluded that a contested Republican primary would be difficult and potentially damaging, even if she were likely to win. The other major candidate is Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, another Trump ally.",
      "Under New York GOP rules, candidates must secure at least 25% of the weighted vote at the state party's February convention to qualify for the June primary ballot, or otherwise submit nominating petitions.",
      "While Stefanik was believed to have early support representing well above that threshold \u2014 possibly more than 75% of the weighted vote due to early endorsements from local party officials \u2014 New York Republicans told CBS News that a challenge from Blakeman still risked becoming a prolonged intraparty fight.",
      "The eventual nominee is expected to face off against incumbent Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul. New York hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2002, though Hochul won her 2022 race by a single-digit margin of\u00a0 6.4 percentage points, which spurred renewed interest among Republicans who viewed the result as a sign of potential Democratic vulnerability.",
      "\"My gut tells me this is not the right political time,\" Stefanik told New York Magazine in an interview on Friday. \"This is not the sort of array of things lining up \u2014 which is so difficult in New York, which is incredibly difficult in a picture-perfect year\u2013let alone with a primary and everything else.\"",
      "\"We viewed it as a waste of resources,\" she said, also citing family considerations. \"I have a 4-year old son, and that is a priority for our family.\"",
      "A senior House Republican official also said Stefanik was frustrated that Mr. Trump declined to endorse her early and effectively clear the field for her, a move that Stefanik allies believed could have avoided a divisive primary.",
      "Mr. Trump did call Blakeman after he entered the race, according to sources familiar with the phone call. He told the county executive that he did not like seeing \"good Republicans\" face each other in an electoral battle.",
      "Asked about the race on Dec. 10, the president repeatedly emphasized his reluctance to publicly intervene, stressing his personal relationships with both candidates and concern about collateral damage from a contested primary.",
      "\"First of all, he's a friend. She's a friend,\" Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House. \"These are two great people running. In a way, I hate to see them running against each other. I hope they're not going to be damaging each other.\"",
      "Mr. Trump went on to praise both candidates, saying, \"Elise is fantastic, and Bruce is. They're two fantastic people, and I always hate it when two very good friends of mine are running.\"",
      "Pointing to the state GOP convention, Trump said, \"I think you'll know pretty much at the end of February what's going to happen. And I'll probably have to, you know, do what I want to do.\"",
      "\"We have two very talented people. Either one should win against the Democrats,\" he added.",
      "After Stefanik announced she would end her campaign, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised her record, calling her \"an incredible advocate\" for her Upstate New York district and \"a true friend\" to Mr. Trump. Leavitt, who previously worked for Stefanik as a top adviser, added that she is \"a great leader, and an even better person.\"",
      "Stefanik, a member of House Republican leadership and one of Trump's closest allies in Congress, had been viewed by New York Republicans as a formidable contender given her national profile and fundraising strength \u2014 over $12 million raised.",
      "But she faced an uphill battle in deep-blue New York, with a recent Siena College poll showing Hochul with a double-digit lead versus both Republicans at this stage of the race.",

      "As the son of comedy legend Carl Reiner, he entered the world of entertainment early, but went on to make a name for himself as a director, filmmaker, and actor in his own right.",
      "He's perhaps best known for his breakout role at age 23 as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic in the hit 1970s sitcom \"All in the Family,\" though others may know him more recently as Bob Day, the father of the quirky Jess Day in \"New Girl.\" Reiner also directed iconic films such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"This is Spinal Tap,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"",
      "Friends and colleagues who worked with Reiner through the years sat down with CBS News to share their personal anecdotes and fond memories of him following the news of his tragic death. Reiner and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Los Angeles home on Dec. 14 and their son, Nick, was charged in their murders.",
      "Here's a look at some tributes from those who knew Reiner best, featured in \"CBS News: Rob Reiner - Scenes from a Life,\" a one-hour special that will be broadcast Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ET/8 p.m. PT on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Albert Brooks",
      "Albert Brooks said he's still in disbelief over the death of his good friend, who he's known since the pair attended drama class together at Beverly Hills High School more than 60 years ago. He said he was heartbroken, but he loves to talk about his friendship with Reiner because it's \"genuine and it's rare.\"",
      "\"Rob was my oldest friend. It's that simple. He's the person that I've known the longest. I met him when I was 14 years old. So I'm still in that not believing it stage,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Brooks said he still finds himself dialing his pal's number to chat, and then freezes when he realizes what he's done.",
      "\"I know it happened, but, you know, I'm driving around and all of a sudden \u2014 I actually two days ago, I called his number,\" he recalled.",
      "Kathy Bates",
      "Oscar-winning actress Kathy Bates has credited Reiner with changing \"the course of [her] life\" by directing her unforgettable performance as Annie Wilkes in \"Misery\" in 1990.",
      "\"If I hadn't done 'Misery,' it would be like George Bailey going back and seeing what his life would have been like if he had never been there,\" she said. \"I wouldn't have had some of the friends that I have now. I wouldn't have had the richness in my life. I quite frankly probably would have stayed in the theater and I doubt I would have had a movie career. I might have dropped out altogether.\"",
      "Kiefer Sutherland",
      "Kiefer Sutherland who played Lt. Jonathan Kendrick in the 1992 legal drama \"A Few Good Men\" said Reiner had an unforgettable presence on set as director. He recalled the tense courtroom scene where Jack Nicholson \u2013 Colonel Nathan Jessup \u2013 had to deliver his now famous line, \"You can't handle the truth!\"",
      "After the first moving take, Sutherland recalled Reiner asking Nicholson if he wanted to go again.",
      "\"No one said a word, and Rob went up to Jack Nicholson and whispered in his ear, 'Do you want to do another one?' And Jack Nicholson said, 'Well, we're here,'\" Sutherland recalled. \"So they did another one, and it was just as extraordinary.\"",
      "The actors planned a marathon filming day, but Sutherland said Reiner was so blown away by Nicholson's performance that day that he sent everyone home early.",
      "\"They had planned to shoot the whole day, and Rob looked at everybody and said, 'I couldn't ask for anything more, so you guys all have the rest of the day off,\" Sutherland said.",

    "story": [
      "Providence, R.I. \u2014 Information from a tipster who had a strange encounter with another man on a sidewalk outside Brown University was key to police identifying the suspect they believe killed two students at the school and then two days later gunned down a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor.",
      "Known only as \"John\" in a Providence police affidavit, the source is being hailed by investigators as the key figure who gave law enforcement the details needed to determine who was behind the Brown shooting, as well as the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who was shot in his Brookline home Monday.",
      "Ever since a shooter unloaded more than 40 rounds inside a Brown engineering building, anxiety and frustration has plagued the Providence, Rhode Island, community as police appeared no closer to identifying the person.",
      "Yet on the sixth day of the investigation, the case gathered steam, ending with police announcing late Thursday they had found the suspected gunman dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "The tipster, John, was the reason.",
      "\"He blew this case right open,\" said Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha of the information provided by the individual that resulted in finding the gunman nearly 24 hours later.",
      "\"When you crack it, you crack it,\" he said.",
      "According to police, John had several encounters with 48-year-old Claudio Neves Valente before Saturday's attack. As police posted images of a person of interest \u2014 now identified as Neves Valente \u2014 John began posting on the social media forum Reddit that he recognized the person and theorized that police should look into \"possibly a rental\" gray Nissan. Reddit users urged him to tell the FBI, and John said he did.",
      "As police reviewed surveillance video, they saw another man \"in close proximity\" to the person of interest, and they posted an image of him in hopes he would come forward. That man turned out to be John.",
      "\"We didn't know they were the same person until John approached a Providence police officer and came into the Providence police station to give an interview. And once we had that interview, we were on the path very quickly to identifying our suspect,\" Neronha said in an interview.",
      "The police affidavit said they learned about the tip on Dec. 16, three days after the shooting and a day after the tip line was created.",
      "Up until that point, the police affidavit says officials had not connected a vehicle to the possible shooter.",
      "That detail led them to get more video of a Nissan Sentra sedan with Florida plates and enabled Providence police officers to tap into a network of more than 70 street cameras operated around the city by surveillance company Flock Safety.",
      "The affidavit says John gave investigators additional critical details: He encountered Neves Valente in the bathroom of the engineering building just hours before the attack, where John noted the suspect's clothing was \"inappropriate and inadequate for the weather.\"",
      "During his police interview, John recognized photos of the suspect's car and then what John thought was probably the suspect from photos of him at an Alamo car rental in November, according to the affaidavit.",
      "John also bumped into Neves Valente outside, mere blocks from the building, where John watched Neves Valente \"suddenly\" turn around from the Nissan when he saw John. What ensued was then a \"game of cat and mouse,\" according to John's testimony - where the two would encounter each other and Neves Valente would run away.",
      "At one point, John says he yelled out \"Your car is back there, why are you circling the block?\"",
      "\"The Suspect responded, 'I don't know you from nobody,' then Suspect repeatedly asked, 'Why are you harassing me?'\" according to the affidavit.",
      "John told police he eventually saw Neves Valente approach the Nissan sedan once more and decided to walk away.",
      "\"Respectfully, I have said all I have to say on the matter to the right people,\" John wrote on Reddit Wednesday night.",
      "On Friday, the FBI would not reveal whether John will receive the $50,000 reward the bureau had offered for information about the Brown shooting.",
      "\"The FBI maintains longstanding policy not to confirm the identity of individuals who assist the FBI by providing tips or information,\" the bureau said in a statement to CBS News. \"Additionally, the FBI will not comment on whether reward money has been paid and to whom. The FBI takes this position for privacy protection, and to ensure the public's continued cooperation and incentivization with any future assistance. Receiving tips from the public remains one of the FBI's best tools in preventing, detecting, and deterring crime.\"",
      "In a letter to FBI Director Kash Patel, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley requested that John be paid the full reward.",
      "Smiley called John a hero whose \"bravery, selflessness and stewardship on behalf of his community went far beyond what anyone could ever hope from a tip.\"",
      "\"I believe that our community is breathing easier today because of the extraordinary assistance John provided to our law enforcement agencies,\" he said.",
      "Ted Docks, special agent in charge of the FBI, said last week it was possible when asked by reporters if John would receive the reward money.",
      "\"It would be logical to think that, absolutely, that individual would be entitled to that,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem says the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used by Brown University shooting suspect Claudio Manuel Neves Valente.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced late Thursday that the Trump administration will pause the diversity visa lottery program, which she said was used eight years ago by the now-deceased man accused of killing two Brown University students and an MIT professor.",
      "\"This heinous individual should never have been allowed in our country,\" Noem said on X. \"At President Trump's direction, I am immediately directing USCIS to pause the DV1 program to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program.\"",
      "Noem said the suspected shooter,\u00a0Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, entered the United States through the program in 2017 and was issued a green card.",
      "What is the diversity visa program?",
      "Launched in the 1990s, the program offers 50,000 visas per year to people from countries with relatively low rates of immigration to the U.S., with recipients selected at random using a lottery. Every year, tens of millions of people vie for visas through the program.",
      "In order to qualify for a diversity visa, applicants must have at least a high school education or two years of work experience in a field that requires training. They are also required to undergo vetting and an interview before getting a visa.",
      "The program was created by Congress, and it's not clear under what legal mechanism the administration can order a pause. Most visas issued through the lottery are overseen by the State Department, and a small number are processed by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \u2014 which is part of DHS \u2014 for applicants already in the U.S.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also paused the issuance of diversity visas \"until we can be sure we know exactly who we are letting into our country,\" a State Department spokesperson told CBS News on Friday.",
      "Criticism from Trump administration",
      "President Trump is a longstanding critic of the diversity visa lottery program, arguing it could pose security risks and isn't sufficiently merit-based, like employment-based visas. He pushed to end it early in his first term, after a man who had received a diversity visa killed eight people in a truck-ramming attack in New York City. Supporters of the visas say recipients are vetted and argue the program is good for the U.S. economy and the country's image abroad.",
      "The first Trump administration suspended the program in 2020, part of a\u00a0broader set of restrictions\u00a0on legal immigration that cited the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0reversed that policy\u00a0in 2021.",
      "Shooting suspect in the U.S.",
      "Neves Valente, 48, was a Portuguese national whose last known residence was in Miami, officials said in a press conference late Thursday.",
      "More than a decade before getting a diversity visa, Neves Valente was admitted to the U.S. on a student visa in 2000 to attend graduate school at Brown University, according to a local police affidavit that was attached to his arrest warrant. Brown's president says he studied at the Ivy League school for a few months starting in the fall of 2000, but he took a leave of absence in the spring of 2001 and formally withdrew two years later.",
      "Authorities said Neves Valente was found dead by suicide in a storage unit in New Hampshire late Thursday, ending a days-long investigation following a shooting at Brown that killed two students and wounded nine over the weekend. Authorities say he is also believed to be responsible for the deadly shooting of an MIT professor in suburban Boston two days after the shooting at Brown.",

    "story": [
      "Workers with an aptitude for explaining how artificial intelligence tools function in simple terms are more likely to find success in the job market, according to an economist who focuses on the economic impact of AI.",
      "Robert Seamans, a professor of management and organizations at the NYU Stern School of Business, thinks such roles are just the kind of new job that AI will create. Indeed, he expects AI to be a part of virtually every worker's future, much like the internet became an integral part of daily life decades ago.",
      "Meanwhile, the workers best positioned to benefit as generative AI tools like ChatGPT reshape the labor market will be those who understand how to use the technology to maximize their own performance, as well as how to test and train AI, Seamans said.",
      "\"AI will change the vast majority of the work we do, but it will affect each occupation in different ways,\" he said. \"A good analogy is to think about computers and the internet and how that changed jobs and the way we work.\"",
      "People who understand AI and, equally important, who are adept at explaining how it works in simple terms, will find themselves in demand, Seamans predicted. For example, he expects companies to recruit what he calls \"AI explainers\" or \"AI translators\" who can help managers better understand an organization's AI tools.",
      "\"The job is to provide a simple layperson's understanding of what's happening under the hood,\" he said.",
      "\"They don't need to be the best computer scientist at creating and running large language models, but they need to understand enough about it so it's clear they're competent in that area and be able to talk about it to a broader audience,\" Seamans added.",
      "Another common role Seamans expects to emerge in the age of artificial intelligence is the \"AI auditor\" who\u00a0checks AI for bias or factual inaccuracies.",
      "\"They would need to know enough about an AI system to run tests on it, and know what benchmarks to use to determine whether bias is there or not,\" he said. \"They could potentially have a legal background, too.\"",
      "Seamans also expects employers to step up their hiring of instructors who can train workers on how to use a company's AI apps. His advice for workers, students and early-career employees?",

    "summary": "Former two-time heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua defeated YouTuber-turned-fighter Jake Paul\u200b by knockout in the sixth round of their much-anticipated bout at the Kaseya Center in Miami late Friday night.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Joshua knocked out Jake Paul in the sixth round of their heavyweight fight on Friday night.",
      "The two-time heavyweight champion displayed why he is one of the sport's elite punchers when he dropped the fading Paul twice in the fifth round.",
      "Sensing the YouTuber was finished, Joshua rocked him with a right uppercut early in the sixth. The native of England then floored Paul with a combination to the head.",
      "Although Paul (12-2) reached his feet again, Joshua (29-4, 26 KOs) finally crushed Paul's upset dream when he dropped him a fourth time with a right to the head. Referee Christopher Young counted Paul out at 1:31 of the round in front of a capacity crowd of 19,600 at the Kaseya Center.",
      "After the fight, Paul said on social media that he sustained a \"double broken jaw\" during the loss and shared an X-ray picture of a jaw broken in two spots.",
      "\"Double broken jaw,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"Give me Canelo in 10 days.\" In a separate post from what appeared to be a hospital room, he added, \"thanks for all the support I'm OK.\"",
      "Prior to the fight, Joshua told CBS Sports that he would consider it \"a failure\" if the match went longer than one round.",
      "But his post-match comments were more tempered.",
      "\"Jake Paul has done really well tonight,\" Joshua said, according to CBS Sports. \"I want to give him his props. He got up time and time again. It was difficult in there for him, but he kept trying to find a way. It takes a real man to do that.\"",
      "With the victory, Joshua can angle to reclaim the heavyweight title he lost against Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua has talked about a long-discussed match with countryman and former champion, Tyson Fury. However, Fury is currently retired following consecutive losses to Usyk in 2024.",
      "It was Joshua's first bout since Daniel Dubois knocked him out in five rounds in September 2024.",
      "Joshua methodically established pace against Paul from the opening round as neither fighter engaged early. Midway through the round, Paul threw an overhand right that Joshua blocked with his glove. In the closing seconds, Joshua scored with a right to the head near the ropes.",
      "In the second, Joshua began utilizing his 6-inch reach advantage by leading with a left jab.",
      "Paul scored with a short right to the head early in the fourth. Later in the round, Paul twice fell to the canvas awkwardly as he again attempted to cut distance during close exchanges",
      "Paul weighed 216 pounds and Joshua weighed 243 for the bout.",
      "In a Truth Social post, President Trump said he watched the fight while flying back to Washington from a rally in North Carolina.",
      "\"On the plane I just got to watch the Jake Paul Fight, and he did really well, especially as a display of GREAT Courage against a very talented and large Anthony Joshua,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"Fantastic Entertainment, but Kudos to Jake for his Stamina, and frankly, Ability, against a much bigger man!\"",
      "The 28-year-old Paul, who began his career in January 2020, originally had targeted an exhibition in Miami with lightweight champion Gervonta Davis last month. But Davis encountered legal problems that scrapped the event. Paul quickly pivoted and landed the bout against Joshua in the same venue.",
      "Celebrities in the crowd included golf champion Rory McIlroy, New York Mets slugger Juan Soto, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy and retired NFL receivers Michael Irvin and Brandon Marshall.",
      "In an undercard bout between retired UFC champions, 50-year-old Anderson Silva scored a second-round TKO against Tyron Woodley.",

    "summary": "The manhunt for the Brown University shooter was complicated by the early misidentification of a person of interest and limited, low-quality video footage.",
    "story": [
      "By the time it finally ended, five full days after the shooting, the manhunt for the Brown University gunman surpassed the four-day search for the Boston Marathon bombers and was on par with the five-day pursuit of Luigi Mangione in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting case.",
      "In the days the gunman was on the run, investigators say he went on to shoot and kill prominent MIT professor\u00a0Nuno Loureiro\u00a0at his home in the Boston area.",
      "The suspect, identified as former Brown grad student Claudio Manuel Neves Valente, was found dead by suicide in a New Hampshire storage unit Thursday night, police said.",
      "The manhunt was complicated by the early misidentification of a person of interest and limited, low-quality video footage.",
      "A timeline of the events shows a few key points where the investigation struggled \u2014 until\u00a0a Reddit tipster provided crucial information that police say led them to the shooter.",
      "Early misidentification of a person of interest",
      "The morning after the shooting, FBI Director Kash Patel announced on X that authorities had detained a person of interest overnight. Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said in a news briefing that the city could \"breathe a little easier.\"",
      "But later in the day, officials released the person after determining that he\u00a0had no involvement\u00a0in the shooting.",
      "Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said that some evidence had \"pointed to\" the initial person of interest, but that the investigation now \"points in a different direction.\" Providence Police Chief Colonel Oscar L. Perez Jr. said the detention was \"not a mistake\" but \"just how investigations work.\"",
      "Multiple law enforcement sources told CBS News on Monday that the investigation had fully moved away from that person, and that investigators \"had to effectively restart after early missteps\" set the process \"back by several hours.\" Officials acknowledged that the case was behind, especially as leads typically narrow after an early window.",
      "Patel and the FBI have faced scrutiny before\u00a0for their use of social media in high-profile cases, notably after Charlie Kirk's assassination, when Patel posted on X that a suspect was in custody, then backtracked two hours later.",
      "Poor images slowed identification",
      "Authorities later shared footage of a second person of interest who they believed was the shooter. But the images released to the public \u2014 even\u00a0an \"enhanced\" video\u00a0\u2014 were blurry and did not clearly show the person's face. The man was dressed in dark clothing and wearing a hat and face covering.",
      "Officials have said part of the Brown University building where the shooting occurred lacked cameras, citing its age.",
      "\"There are fewer, if any, cameras in that location, I imagine because it's an older building,\" Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in a news briefing.",
      "Brown University said in a statement that the campus has \"an expansive network of security cameras,\" more than 1,200 in all, but acknowledged that cameras \"do not extend to every hallway, classroom, laboratory and office across the 250+ buildings on campus.\"",
      "Video obtained from the neighborhood shows the second person of interest walking along a few streets near campus about two hours before the shooting, but his trail was lost after leaving the crime scene.",
      "Investigators re-canvassed the area around the campus on Monday, according to multiple law enforcement sources, and collected CCTV footage from homes and local businesses to attempt to reconstruct the suspect's movements and identify vehicles or escape routes that may have been used.",
      "However, it wasn't until a Reddit user posted comments about his encounters with the man, and shared information about the car he was driving, that law enforcement was able to pick up the trail and identify who they were looking for. They said they received the information from the Reddit tipster, known as \"John,\" on Tuesday, Dec. 16.",
      "By that time, another killing had already taken place.",
      "Perez, the police chief, acknowledged his department was under a lot of pressure to solve the case.",
      "\"There was a lot of criticism, too, as far as, like, how long has the investigation taken,\" Perez told CBS News in an interview Friday. \"And sometimes, you know, it's just that when you're not a police officer, you don't understand how this works,\" he said, explaining that investigators have to evaluate all the leads and physical evidence, which can be a painstaking process.",
      "\"And so it takes work and \u2026 you can't do that within minutes. Sometimes it takes days,\" Perez said.",
      "Connecting the dots with a suspect on the run",
      "An FBI special agent said in\u00a0charging documents\u00a0that there is probable cause to believe the same gunman who committed the mass shooting at Brown on Saturday, Dec. 13, then traveled from Rhode Island to Massachusetts to murder Lourerio, who was shot at his home on Monday, Dec. 15.",
      "Following the Reddit user's tip, investigators determined that a gray Nissan Sentra rental car was captured on license-plate readers near Brown University from Dec. 1 to Dec. 12.",
      "When police showed the tipster, \"John,\" two of those vehicle photos, known as Flock images, he said, \"Holy s---. That might be it.\"",
      "CCTV images from the day before the shooting also captured an individual in the area of Brown University \"consistent with images\" of the suspect that were taken from surveillance video at the agency in Boston where he rented the car. Rental car records confirmed the suspect's identity, police said.",
      "At some point after the shooting, the suspect left Providence and drove back to Boston. The charging documents say Google email and voice accounts associated with the shooter were logged onto from IP addresses near Boston University on Sunday, Dec. 14.",
      "At that point, police still didn't know who they were looking for in the shooting that killed two students, sophomore Ella Cook and freshman Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, and wounded nine others.",
      "Then on the evening of Monday, Dec. 15, Lourerio was shot at his home in Brookline, Massachusetts. He died the next day.",
      "The professor's home is about a half mile from the area where the suspect logged into his Google accounts the day before. Police say surveillance footage also captured images of a vehicle matching the description of the suspect's rental car leaving the area after Lourerio was shot, and Foley said, \"there's video of him entering that apartment building\" that night.",
      "While the motive is still shrouded in mystery, investigators believe the suspect and the MIT professor had crossed paths before. Both studied physics at the same university program in their native Portugal in the late 1990s.",
      "\"My understanding is that they did know each other,\" said Leah Foley, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts.",
      "The tip from \"John\" about the suspicious man and his car in Providence came in to police the day after Loureiro's shooting, and the investigation accelerated.",
      "\"He blew this case right open,\" Neronha said.",
      "Sources told CBS News that once they had the name of the suspect, they found the storage unit he'd rented in New Hampshire and knew to search there.",
      "That's where they found his body Thursday night \u2014 two days after he had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, an autopsy revealed.",

    "summary": "A federal judge ruled that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Justice Department said Friday it will appeal a pair of decisions tossing out the criminal cases against former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James on the grounds that Lindsey Halligan, the prosecutor who secured the indictments against them, was unlawfully appointed to her role as interim U.S. attorney.",
      "The appeal was expected, as the White House and Attorney Pam Bondi had indicated that the Trump administration would ask the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit to review last month's rulings from U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie. But it comes as Halligan and Justice Department lawyers have so far twice failed to secure a new indictment against James.",
      "Halligan's name is on the notices of appeal, and she is listed\u00a0as \"United States attorney and special attorney.\"",
      "Currie ruled that Halligan's appointment as interim U.S. attorney violated federal law and the Constitution's Appointments Clause and ordered the criminal charges brought against Comey and James to be dismissed.",
      "\"I conclude that all actions flowing from Ms. Halligan's defective appointment, including securing and signing Mr. Comey's indictment, constitute unlawful exercises of executive power and must be set aside,\" Currie wrote in her\u00a0opinion in the Comey case, a line that she repeated in her\u00a0ruling in the James case.",
      "Halligan is a former insurance lawyer who was a member of President Trump's defense team in the since-ended criminal case stemming from his alleged mishandling of sensitive government documents. She was tapped by Attorney General Pam Bondi to serve as the interim U.S. attorney in eastern Virginia in September.",
      "Soon after Halligan temporarily took the helm of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, she secured indictments against Comey and James. Comey was charged with two counts stemming from testimony he gave to Congress in September 2020 and pleaded not guilty. He was indicted just days before the statute of limitations for the offenses was set to expire.",
      "James faced charges of bank fraud and pleaded not guilty.",
      "Since Currie ordered the cases against Comey and James to be tossed out, Halligan has attempted to secure a new indictment against James. But grand juries in Norfolk and Alexandria, Virginia, have each\u00a0separately refused to indict James again.",
      "It's unclear whether Halligan has sought to re-indict Comey, though Currie suggested in her November decision that prosecutors could not seek a new indictment in his case because the statute of limitations expired at the end of September. Additionally, a separate federal judge in Washington, D.C., blocked the Justice Department from accessing material it seized from one of Comey's friends more than five years ago, which Halligan had relied on when she presented the case against Comey to a grand jury in September.",
      "Comey and James had also moved to have the criminal charges against them tossed out on the grounds that their respective prosecutions were vindictive and selective. Judges overseeing their cases had not yet ruled on those bids, however, when their cases were dismissed.",

    "summary": "Millions of people with an Affordable Care Act health plan face a massive jump in premiums next year \u2014 this chart shows just how much.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Americans are bracing for higher health costs in 2026, as subsidies that help them pay for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act are set to expire on December 31.",
      "Experts warn\u00a0that a failure in Congress to extend the tax credits could be financially devastating for individual policyholders, while also raising health care costs as a whole. Roughly 22 million Americans receive the ACA subsidies, which were created in 2021 to lower households' monthly premiums.",
      "New\u00a0data from investment adviser SmartAsset projects how much people around the U.S. with an ACA plan would have paid on average for coverage in 2025 if they hadn't received the enhanced subsidies. As the analysis shows, monthly premiums for the government health insurance would've been hundreds of dollars higher.",
      "In Mississippi, where around 11% of residents are enrolled in an ACA plan, participants would have seen their average monthly premiums jump from $41 to $605, a 1,376% increase, SmartAsset found. In West Virginia, enrollees' premiums would have risen an average of 1,058%.",
      "A spokesperson for SmartAsset said the analysis captures 2025 costs, but noted the data amounts to a \"close approximation\" of how much more people with ACA coverage could expect to pay next year without the tax credits.",
      "SmartAsset used public records from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' 2025 Marketplace Open Enrollment Period to calculate the average cost of ACA plans.",
      "The exact price hikes people could see next will depend on a range of factors, including their insurance plan, age, household income, health status and where they live, according to a spokesperson from KFF. The health policy group estimates that annual out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for the 22 million ACA enrollees who rely on the subsidies.",
      "What is the status of the ACA tax credits?",
      "The tax credits are set to lapse at the end of the year. Democratic lawmakers have pushed for an extension\u00a0but lack enough support in the Republican-led Congress. And while the House passed a health care bill this week that includes several policies favored by Republicans, it excludes an extension of the tax credits and faces hurdles in the Senate.",
      "Both chambers of Congress have left Washington until early next year, making it all but certain that the tax credits will expire on December 31. But four GOP members this week signed a Democratic measure to force a vote on extending the subsidies for three years, teeing up a final vote early next year.",
      "If Congress fails to solve the tax credit issue, some enrollees will qualify for a smaller subsidy, while others could lose eligibility completely, according to KFF.",
      "With sharply higher ACA costs on the horizon, the Congressional Budget Office estimates\u00a0that about 4 million people could drop their health insurance altogether. Experts say that could lead to higher costs for people with other types of health insurance because hospitals will have\u00a0to provide more uncompensated care for those lacking coverage.",
      "\"Hospitals can only reconcile that by raising their prices for everybody,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News last week.",

    "summary": "The latest deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein, released by the Justice Department, adds to a huge trove of documents and photos that have already been made public.",
    "story": [
      "As the public begins to sort through the deluge of files related to Jeffrey Epstein released by the Department of Justice on Friday, some of the material might seem familiar.",
      "That's because there's been a steady stream of material made public from various investigations into the deceased sex offender during the last year, some of which undoubtedly overlaps with the voluminous Justice Department release mandated by federal legislation passed in November.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act gave Attorney General Pam Bondi until Dec. 19 to make public all unclassified records, documents, communications and investigative materials in possession of the Justice Department, the FBI and U.S. attorneys' offices (with some personal information redacted to protect victims).",
      "Some of that material \u2014 tens of thousands of pages \u2014 has already been released by a House committee that subpoenaed the Justice Department and Epstein's estate. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee have indicated they're still expecting even more documents to be produced by Epstein's estate in the future, as well as material from banking institutions he did business with. They've pledged to release more documents as they come in.",
      "Among other things, the documents released so far include emails and text messages showing that Epstein continued to court the rich and famous right up until his 2019 arrest.",
      "Here is an overview of documents already disclosed to the public:",
      "Dec. 18, 2025:\u00a0Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a batch of 68 photos from a trove of about 95,000 the committee obtained from Epstein's estate. Among them were photos of passages from \"Lolita\" written on a woman's body; a picture of a Ukrainian passport, with details blacked out; and text messages about 18-year-old from Russia.",
      "Dec. 12, 2025: Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released another selection of photos from Epstein's estate.The photos include snapshots of prominent figures like President Trump, former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Dec. 4, 2025: Democrats on the Oversight Committee released 73 photos and four videos of Epstein's estate on the 72-acre island known as Little St. James that he owned in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Epstein allegedly exploited underage girls for sex at the island, and he had stakes in businesses in the U.S. territory.",
      "Nov. 12, 2025: The House Oversight Committee released 20,000 records from Epstein's estate, including scores of emails. The disgraced financier often referenced Mr. Trump, writing of the president at one point: \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop.\" Other messages showed him bantering with influential Harvard professor and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and attempting to reconnect with Bill Gates. None of those men have been accused of wrongdoing.",
      "Oct. 30, 2025: Buckingham Palace announced that it was stripping the king's younger brother of his titles, relegating Prince Andrew to his civilian name, Andrew Mountbatten Windsor. The announcement came weeks after news outlets in the United Kingdom revealed a 2011 email in which Andrew told Epstein, \"we are in this together.\" The former prince has been accused of sexually assaulting a young Virginia Giuffre, who said she was trafficked by Epstein; Andrew settled Giuffre's lawsuit but denied wrongdoing.",
      "Sept. 8, 2025: House Oversight released a tranche from Epstein's estate, including a 2003 birthday note to Epstein that appeared to be signed by Mr. Trump. The letter, written inside a drawing of what appears to be the form of a woman, ends with, \"A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday \u2014 and may every day be another wonderful secret. Donald J. Trump.\"",
      "The president denied penning the message, and Republicans accused Democrats of cherry-picking documents.",
      "Sept. 2, 2025: The panel released more than 33,000 pages of files from the Justice Department, including court documents, flight records, and a video of Epstein's cell block from before his death that includes a minute missing from earlier videos. Many of the documents were already in the public domain. Democratic lawmakers said just 3% of the pages were new. Those disclosures included logs of flights on Epstein's plane from 2000 to 2014 that were kept by Customs and Border Protection, according to Democrats.",
      "Aug. 22, 2025: The Justice Department released a transcript and audio recording of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's interview with convicted Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year sentence for involvement in trafficking. Maxwell said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me.\" She said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings.\" She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "Feb. 27, 2025: The White House gave a group of 15 conservative influencers binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" Several influencers said the binders contained little new info.",
      "Prior to 2025: Other documents, including contacts, schedules, flight logs and depositions, were made public previously, often as part of Epstein and Maxwell's criminal cases and in connection with civil lawsuits filed by survivors.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, will\u00a0air on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Tuesday.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",

This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",

    "summary": "Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning correspondent who covered the Vietnam and Gulf wars, has died. He was 91.",
    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\"Peter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation - intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\" said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now the AP's chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, when he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak, air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \"They are hitting the center of the city.\"",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\" Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \"He sank to the ground at my feet.\"",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier's obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining the AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia's economy was in shambles and the country's enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP's Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who among them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by the AP's New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau's papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they'd have historic value someday. They're now in the AP's archives.",
      "Arnett remained with the AP until 1981, when he joined the newly-formed CNN.",
      "Ten years later, he was in Baghdad covering another war. He not only reported on the front-line fighting but won exclusive, and controversial, interviews with then-President Saddam Hussein and future 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden.",
      "In 1995, he published the memoir \"Live From the Battlefield: From Vietnam to Baghdad, 35 Years in the World's War Zones.\"",
      "Arnett resigned from CNN in 1999, months after the network retracted an investigative report he did not prepare but narrated alleging that deadly Sarin nerve gas had been used on deserting American soldiers in Laos in 1970.",
      "He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military's war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.",
      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China's Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a - you know - enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\"",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

Instead, they were borrowed on capital markets.",
      "After almost four years of war, the International Monetary Fund estimates that Ukraine will need $161 billion in 2026 and 2027. The government in Kyiv is on the verge of bankruptcy, and desperately needs the money by spring.",

The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin for talks on U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan.",
      "Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov said late Friday that a Ukrainian delegation had met with American and European partners in the U.S. He gave few details, but said they agreed to continue \"joint work in the near future.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:16:25 -0500",
    "summary": "To what does LEGO owe its remarkable half-century success story? CBS News visits the toy giant's Denmark headquarters to find out.",
    "story": [
      "Billund, Denmark - Millions of people around the world instantly recognize the look, the feel - especially under foot - and even the sound of LEGO. The plastic blocks have shaped childhood memories for generations.",
      "At the company's home in Denmark, decades of those experiences are captured inside a secret museum that only LEGO employees can access. CBS News, however, got a rare look inside that little-known museum, where it was possible to trace the evolution of one of the world's most recognizable and beloved toys.",
      "The museum sits next to the original home of LEGO's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen - a reminder of the toy giant's humble beginnings. The brand's name reflects its philosophy: \"LEGO\" comes from the Danish phrase \"leg godt,\" or \"play well.\"",
      "Inside the museum are some of the very first LEGO bricks, including pieces that date back to the 1950s. Among the earliest creations housed there is the first LEGO \"system\" that was ever assembled - a small town that laid the foundation for everything the company would go on to build.",
      "That system \u2014 the idea that every LEGO brick, regardless of when it was made, can connect \u2014 dates back to 1955, when the company assembled that first play town. Over the decades, LEGO creations have evolved from medieval villages to mind-blowing architectural feats.",
      "The collection features vintage sets that continue functioning as they were designed to, many decades later, including a working drawbridge castle from the 1970s. But there's been no shortage of evolution, either. From the early designs, LEGO's builds have grown increasingly ambitious and sophisticated.",
      "Along with the classics, the museum showcases intricate creations ranging from miniatures of iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower to LEGO flower bouquets. Other pieces have evolved from LEGO's own sub-brands. Many of today's parents will be familiar, for instance, with armies of tiny characters from the modern kids' TV fantasy superhero show Ninjago.",
      "Inside Lego House",
      "CBS News also got a glimpse inside LEGO House, a nearly 130,000-square-foot monument to the toy, filled with some 25 million LEGO bricks, including those of the 6 million-plus that make up the striking \"Tree of Creativity.\"",
      "Standing nearly 50 feet high, it's the largest known LEGO build in the world. Each branch is packed with detail, a feast for the eyes.",
      "Behind all the creations is LEGO's own in-house army of creatives.",
      "\"There are about 700 designers here,\" Andr\u00e9 Doxey, the LEGO Group's first American Head of Design, told CBS News.",
      "Doxey said creativity, not technical skill, has been key to LEGO's enduring appeal.",
      "\"You don't have to be a designer,\" he said. \"You just have to be brave, creative and curious, and give it a try.\"",
      "Doxey believes LEGO's remarkable enduring popularity is owed largely to the freedom it offers.",
      "\"We know people love to create, kids love to create,\" he said. \"Our system is a creative medium. It enables them to imagine anything they want to imagine.\"",
      "LEGO: Not just for the kids \u2014 but mainly for the kids",
      "And LEGO has found that the appeal extends well beyond childhood. Nostalgia plays a powerful role at the company, and so-called AFOLs \u2014 Adult Fans of LEGO \u2014 represent a significant and growing market.",
      "But Design Master Milan Madge knows the audience well, and while not denying the rising popularity of more complex, grown-up builds, he said children remain the company's priority.",
      "\"They're our first inspiration,\" he said. \"We try to act like children and see the world through their eyes.\"",
      "While modern designs are often created digitally to streamline production, Madge said he still prefers working with physical bricks.",
      "\"There's a real connection between the mind and the creative process when you're doing hands-on work,\" he said.",
      "That simple tactile connection \u2014 brick by brick \u2014 has helped make LEGO the top-grossing toy company in the world. Families build together. Friends gather around shared creations. Communities form, united by the sound of bricks rattling in a box.",
      "\"Everyone knows that sound,\" Doxey told CBS News. \"You shake it, and you know exactly what it is.\"",
      "A beloved toy, with a plastic problem",
      "Beyond all the creativity and the nostalgia, however, the LEGO Group is also grappling with a fundamental issue in a world facing what a majority of scientists say is a climate crisis: The company's empire is still built almost entirely on plastic, and one of the key components in most plastic is fossil fuel.",
      "Every ton of LEGO produced requires about two tons of petrochemicals in the manufacturing process, according to the global sustainability information and data platform, illuminem. LEGO makes approximately 60 billion bricks per year, and based on illuminem's data, some of the company's largest sets would require the equivalent of over 60 pounds of petrochemical equivalent to produce.",
      "Despite ambitious climate pledges, the company has so far failed to find a sustainable path for its toys.",
      "LEGO abandoned a \"bottles to bricks\" initiative in 2023 after finding the proposed recyclable material it hoped to use would, in fact, increase emissions compared to its current materials.",
      "\"LEGO bricks are made for children, so they must meet extremely high quality and safety standards,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"They must also be durable, and are precision-engineered to accuracy of less than a hair's width so that a brick made today still fits one made 60 years ago.\"",
      "The company said it has tested more than 600 different materials for its LEGO bricks, including some derived from \"sustainable-soruces sugarcane\" and recycled materials from artificial marble kitchen countertops.",
      "\"Other materials have shown potential, but have not met our strict quality, safety and durability requirements, or would not have helped reduce our carbon footprint,\" the statement said, adding that the company is on track for \"60% of the materials we buy to be produced from sustainable sources\" by the end of the year.",
      "Even after all these years, LEGO continues to evolve.",

      "Starting Feb. 1, the city of Rome is imposing a 2-euro, or $2.35, fee for tourists to get close to the fountain during prime-time daylight hours. The view for those admiring the late Baroque masterpiece from the piazza above remains free.",
      "The tourist fee announced Friday is part of the Eternal City's efforts to manage tourist flows in a particularly congested part of town, improve the experience and offset the maintenance costs of preserving all of Rome's cultural heritage. Officials estimate it could net the city $7.6 million extra a year.",
      "The fee, which has been discussed and debated for more than a year, follows a similar ticketing system at Rome's Pantheon monument.",
      "In such cases, city residents have been exempt from the fees. The same holds true at Trevi, while the tourist tax and new 5-euro or nearly $6 tourist ticket fee for some city museums is being rolled out in conjunction with a plan to broaden the number of museums that are free for registered Roman residents.",
      "\"We believe that culture is a fundamental right of citizenship,\" Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri told a news conference. \"We think it's correct and positive that the citizens of Rome can enjoy our museums free of charge.\"",
      "At the same time, he said, the Trevi tourist fee is a minimal amount that shouldn't discourage visitors, but rather allow for a more organized visit. The city decided to impose it after seeing positive results already from a yearlong experiment to stagger and limit the number of visitors who can reach the front basin edge of the fountain by imposing lines and an entrance and exit pathway.",
      "So far this year, around 9 million people have waited in line to get that close-up visit, with some days as many as 70,000 passing through, Gualtieri said. That system now becomes permanent from 9 a.m.-9 p.m., with the fee to be paid by nonresidents. Visitors can either pay in advance online, while waiting in line or by buying tickets at tourist locations around town.",
      "After nightfall, access is open and free.",
      "Pope Urban VIII initially commissioned the fountain in 1640. In 1730, Pope Clement XII revived the project and the current fountain corresponds to the original designs of Roman architect Nicola Salvi.",
      "The towering fountain features at the Titan god flanked by falls cascading down the travertine rocks into a shallow turquoise pool, where Marcello Mastroianni and Anita Ekberg famously took their nighttime dip in \"La Dolce Vita.\"",
      "While bathing is prohibited nowadays, legend has it that visitors who toss a coin over their shoulders and make a wish will return to Rome.",
      "European officials have sought to curb overtourism amid protests from residents who say large amounts of visitors are making cities difficult to live in. Last year, Venice became the first city to\u00a0impose a tax for day-tripping tourists. A spate of viral incidents, including a woman who scaled the Trevi Fountain to\u00a0fill up her water bottle\u00a0and a British man who\u00a0carved his and his girlfriends' initials\u00a0into the Colosseum, also drew attention to the issue.",
      "\"These tourists are also vandals, because they have no respect for our cultural heritage, which belongs not just to Italy, but to the whole world,\" said Daniela Santanch\u00e8, Italy's tourism minister, at the time. \"We've introduced a bill with a very simple concept: You break it, you pay for it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Seven wild Asiatic elephants were killed and a calf was injured when a high-speed passenger train collided with a herd crossing the tracks in India's northeastern state of Assam early Saturday, local authorities said.",
      "The train driver spotted the herd of about 100 elephants and used the emergency brakes, but the train still hit some of the animals, Indian Railways spokesman Kapinjal Kishore Sharma told The Associated Press.",
      "Five train coaches and the engine derailed following the impact, but there were no human casualties, Sharma said.",
      "Veterinarians carried out autopsies on the dead elephants, which were to be buried later in the day.",
      "The accident site is a forested area around 78 miles southeast of Assam's capital city of Guwahati. Railway tracks in the state are frequented by elephants, but Indian Railways said in a statement the accident location wasn't a designated elephant corridor. Trains that pass through the country's 150 wildlife corridors are under government orders to reduce speed to prevent collisions.",
      "The Rajdhani Express train, traveling from Sairang in Mizoram state bordering Myanmar, was bound for the national capital of New Delhi with 650 passengers onboard when it hit with elephants.",
      "\"We delinked the coaches which were not derailed, and the train resumed its journey for New Delhi. Around 200 passengers who were in the five derailed coaches have been moved to Guwahati in a different train,\" Sharma said.",
      "Speeding trains hitting wild elephants is not rare in Assam, which is home to an estimated 7,000 wild Asiatic elephants, one of the highest concentrations of the pachyderm in India. Since 2020, at least a dozen elephants have been killed by speeding trains across the state. 20 elephants are killed in train accidents every year on average, according to Indian government data. The deaths usually happen when elephants cross railway lines that run through their habitats.",
      "The country recently opened an elephant hospital\u00a0in Mathura. The southern state of Tamil Nadu has also launched an artificial intelligence and machine learning-enabled surveillance system meant to help prevent elephant deaths on railways.",

    "summary": "Putin claims no \"willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal as he touts battlefield gains, and Kyiv claims a brazen strike on a ship far from Russia.",
    "story": [
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Friday that his country was \"not seeing the willingness from Ukraine\" to negotiate a peace deal, again blaming the country he ordered a full-scale invasion of nearly four years ago for the continuation of a war he's refused even to acknowledge is a war.",
      "Putin said he was open to a negotiated end to what he calls a \"special military operation,\" but only on his terms, insisting, as he has for years, that Ukraine must accept a massive, formal forfeiture of occupied territory and some degree of national demilitarization \u2014   both terms that Kyiv has rejected.",
      "The Russian president said his forces had \"fully seized strategic initiative\" in the conflict and would take even more ground along the roughly 600-mile front line in eastern Ukraine before the end of the year.",
      "\"Our troops are advancing all across the line of contact, faster in some areas or slower in some others, but the enemy is retreating in all sectors,\" Putin said during the live, wide-ranging end-of-year news conference that has been a hallmark of his tenure.",
      "His remarks came as Ukraine claimed a dramatic new blow against Russia, but also as divisions among European nations over how to keep supporting Kyiv \u2014 fueled, many believe, by Moscow's pressure tactics \u2014 were laid bare.",
      "Putin's latest casting of blame for the war at both Kyiv and its backers in Europe also came as a senior\u00a0Russian envoy prepared to meet again for talks with Trump administration officials in Florida this weekend. The White House is pushing hard for a negotiated resolution to the conflict that President Trump had vowed to end quickly when he took office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday called proposals being negotiated with the U.S. \"very workable,\" suggesting they could be finalized in a matter of days, allowing American officials to discuss with their Russian counterparts.",
      "Ukraine claims drone strike on Russian \"shadow fleet\" tanker in Mediterranean",
      "Ukraine has been defending itself with the support of the U.S. and its European partners, and as Putin spoke in Moscow, Kyiv claimed a significant expansion of its wartime resistance, with a first purported attack on an oil tanker said to be part of Russia's sanctions-violating \"shadow fleet\" in the Mediterranean.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's SBU intelligence agency said Friday that it had \"struck a tanker belonging to Russia's 'shadow fleet' in neutral waters in the Mediterranean Sea for the first time,\" touting it as an \"unprecedented special operation more than 2,000 km [1,200 miles] from the territory of our state.\"",
      "The SBU said it used aerial drones to disable the Oman-flagged oil tanker Qendil, which it said was empty at the time, and thus \"did not pose any threat to the ecological situation in the region.\"",
      "The SBU shared a black-and-white video, seemingly captured by a drone, of the purported strike that shows several explosions on the deck of a tanker.",
      "\"Russia used this tanker to circumvent sanctions and earn money that went to the war against Ukraine,\" a source in the SBU told CBS News. \"Therefore, from the point of view of international law and the laws and customs of war, this is an absolutely legitimate target for the SBU. The enemy must understand that Ukraine will not stop and will strike it anywhere in the world, wherever it may be.\"",
      "Ukraine has long targeted\u00a0fuel tankers and\u00a0infrastructure\u00a0in Russian ports and on land as part of its efforts to undermine Moscow's war funding, but only this month has Kyiv acknowledged attacking vessels outside Russia's territorial waters. CBS News reported on the first such strikes, targeting tankers off the coasts of Turkey and West Africa, just over a week ago.",
      "The SBU said the new strike had disabled the Qendil, which ship tracking website MarineTraffic.com confirmed was located in the eastern Mediterranean as of Friday afternoon. According to MarineTraffic, the vessel \u2014   which has not been listed by the U.S. Treasury among the Russian shadow fleet ships subjected to sanctions \u2014   was sailing from the Indian port of Sikka to the Russian port of Ust-Luga.",
      "The U.S. government has sanctioned many vessels and maritime companies in an effort to crack down on Russia's shadow fleet, ships with often murky registration and ownership that Moscow allegedly uses to evade heavy Western sanctions on its energy products, providing vital revenue for its war effort.",
      "The Trump administration accuses several major oil producers, including Russia, Venezuela, and Iran, of using a global fleet of such ships, and just last week, U.S. military forces seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker\u00a0after it left a port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News.",
      "Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was\u00a0sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago\u00a0for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the Middle East.",
      "Asked Friday about the strike on the Qendil during his news conference, Putin was dismissive, but vowed to respond.",
      "\"They're pursuing some utilitarian purposes,\" the Russian leader said, without confirming any specifics. \"They want to raise insurance premiums, but this will not bring about the result they desire. This is not going to disrupt the supplies. This would only create additional threats, and Russia is certainly going to respond.\"",
      "Despite divisions, EU agrees on financial lifeline for Ukraine",
      "The European Union, meanwhile, stepped up overnight to offer a support package for Ukraine worth more than $100 billion \u2014 but the bloc could not agree on proposals pushed by leaders to use frozen Russian assets to do it.",
      "After failing to agree on specifics, the EU ended up taking out an interest-free loan for Ukraine, against its own budget, intended to fund the country's military and economic needs for two years.",
      "EU leaders wanted to finance the aid package with the frozen Russian assets, but there was always resistance to that idea among some members \u2014   most notably Belgium, where much of the ringfenced Russian money is held.",
      "Putin renewed threats in his remarks on Friday that there would be severe consequences for European nations that chose to use the Russian money, held as part of the sanctions against Moscow.",
      "He said any such move would have been \"daylight robbery.\"",
      "\"Why can't this robbery be carried out? Because the consequences could be grave for the robbers,\" he said Friday.",
      "Russia has been accused repeatedly in recent months of waging a hybrid war against Ukraine's European partners, with a series of unclaimed drone incursions, including around airports and military bases, Russian warplanes violating European \u2014   and NATO \u2014   airspace, and other acts of alleged sabotage targeting vital infrastructure.",
      "\"If Europe had walked away today without an agreement, we would not only have failed Ukraine, we would have failed ourselves,\" Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said Friday, putting a positive spin on the agreement that was reached.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz also hailed the agreement for a \"zero-interest loan\" for Ukraine, and leaving room for the Russian assets to be leveraged in the future.",
      "\"These funds are sufficient to cover the military and budgetary needs of Ukraine for the two years to come,\" Merz said, noting that the frozen Russian assets will remain blocked unless and until Russia pays reparations to Ukraine for the huge damage inflicted during the war.",
      "\"If Russia does not pay reparations, we will \u2014   in full accordance with international law \u2014   make use of Russian immobilized assets for paying back the loan,\" the German leader said.",
      "Ukraine's government welcomed the deal, but made it clear that Kyiv still feels Russia's frozen assets should be accessed in support of its defense.",
      "\"Indeed, there are moments when one should keep in mind that 'Perfect is the enemy of good,'\" Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya said. \"It was a long night for European leaders, but they were able to come up with a workable result.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 19 Dec 2025 06:33:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Sydney\u00a0\u2014 Australia will use a sweeping buyback scheme to \"get guns off our streets,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday, showing his government was keen to take quick action less than a week after a terrorist attack left 15 people dead at a Jewish holiday gathering on Sydney's famed Bondi Beach.",
      "Sajid Akram and his son Naveed are accused of opening fire on the festival, which was organized to mark the first day of Hanukkah on Sunday, in what was one of Australia's deadliest mass shootings.",
      "Just hours after the attack, Albanese vowed to toughen national gun laws that allowed 50-year-old Sajid to own six high-powered rifles.",
      "\"There is no reason someone living in the suburbs of Sydney needed this many guns,\" he said.",
      "Australia would pay gun owners to surrender \"surplus, newly banned and illegal firearms.\"",
      "Albanese said Monday that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\" He specifically suggested measures that could limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and mandating a review process for existing licenses.",
      "The prime minister said the federal government would evenly split the cost of the buyback program with Australia's state and territorial administrations, with further details to be worked out when lawmakers return to work next week.",
      "Investigation continues as Sydney remains on high alert",
      "Sajid Akram, 50, was killed in a gunfight with police, but his 24-year-old son Naveed survived. The unemployed bricklayer was charged earlier this week with 15 counts of murder, an act of terrorism, and dozens of other serious crimes after waking up from a coma in a Sydney hospital.",
      "Albanese said the attack was inspired by ISIS ideology, and Australian police are still investigating whether the pair may have met with Islamist extremists during a visit to the Philippines just a couple weeks before the shooting.",
      "They spent most of November in the south of the Asian nation, in a hotel in Davao City. A hotel employee told CBS News on Thursday that the father and son extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said staff noticed nothing particularly suspicious about the men during their nearly monthlong stay.",
      "Sydney, meanwhile, remains on high alert almost a week after the shootings.",
      "Armed police released seven men from custody on Friday, a day after detaining them on a tip they may have been plotting a \"violent act,\" as they reportedly headed for Bondi Beach.",
      "Police said there was no established link with the alleged Bondi gunmen and \"no immediate safety risk to the community.\"",
      "A second major Australian gun buyback spurred by a mass shooting",
      "The new buyback, assuming it is approved by lawmakers next week, will be the largest such government-funded program since 1996, when then-Prime Minister John Howard cracked down on firearms in the wake of another mass shooting, in which 35 people were killed in the town of Port Arthur.",
      "Just 12 days after that attack, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm, and initiating the massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law's adoption, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia,\" former premier Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the 1996 law, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades after, there wasn't a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen \u2026 Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found Australia still has some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The\u00a0paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures had yet to be brought into force 29 years later, and others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "But \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",
      "Albanese, along with state and territorial leaders, agreed on Monday to look at ways to bolster gun laws, including by accelerating the launch of the national firearms register called for in the 1996 legislation, making gun licenses available only to Australian citizens, and imposing new restrictions the types of weapons that are legal for licensees to own.",
      "A memorial at sea, and a day of reflection planned for Bondi Beach victims",
      "Hundreds of people plunged into the ocean at Bondi Beach on Friday to honor the 15 people killed in the terror attack, forming a massive ring in the sea on surf and paddle boards, as Albanese announced a national day of reflection to be observed on Sunday.",
      "Albanese urged Australians to light candles at 6:47 p.m. on Sunday, \"exactly one week since the attack unfolded.\"",
      "On Friday, swimmers and surfers paddled into a circle, bobbing in the gentle morning swell, splashing water and roaring with emotion.",
      "\"They slaughtered innocent victims, and today I'm swimming out there and being part of my community again to bring back the light,\" security consultant Jason Carr, 53, told AFP. \"We're still burying bodies. But I just felt it was important.\"",
      "Carole Schlessinger, a 58-year-old chief executive of a children's charity, said there was a \"beautiful energy\" at the ocean gathering. \"To be together is such an important way of trying to deal with what's going on.\"",
      "\"It was really lovely to be part of it,\" she said, adding: \"I personally am feeling very numb. I'm feeling super angry. I'm feeling furious.\"",

    "story": [
      "Sydney \u2014 Hundreds of people gathered in Sydney on Thursday to mourn the youngest victim of the terrorist attack that targeted a Hanukkah celebration on Australia's Bondi Beach. The 10-year-old girl, who has been publicly identified only as Matilda, has become a symbol of the country's grief for the 15 people killed by two gunmen.",
      "Dozens of others were wounded in the shooting, including American Rabbi Leibel Lazaroff, a 20-year-old who CBS News found holding a menorah in his hospital bed on Thursday as he was treated for gunshots to his stomach and thighs.",
      "Leibel was volunteering at the event to mark the first day of Hanukkah, when shots rang out. His parents, meanwhile, were asleep at their home in Texas.",
      "\"In the middle of the night, we got, someone came to our door to tell us that there was a terrorist attack, and that Leibel was \u2014 people knew he was shot, but did not know what had happened to him,\" his mother Manya told CBS News on Thursday. \"At that point, we did not if he was alive or what his status was.\"",

      "\"We immediately tried to figure out a way how to get here,\" said his father, Rabbi Yossi Lazaroff.",
      "After flying halfway around the world, they were at their son's bedside in a Sydney hospital, where he told them his story.",
      "Leibel told his parents that after the gunfire began, he heard a police officer screaming that they had been shot, so he rushed over and took off his shirt to use as a tourniquet. Trained in how to use a gun, he told his father he asked the officer to handover their firearm so he could try to shoot back at the gunmen.",
      "\"As he was doing that, Leibel himself got shot,\" his father told CBS News.",
      "\"I actually wasn't surprised,\" his mother said. \"He's a firecracker. He is a quick thinker. He is someone who is brave, strong, feisty, very feisty, and someone who's very quick thinking.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",
      "Asked about the meeting in Miami, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow was preparing for contacts with the U.S. to learn about the results of the meetings in Berlin, but didn't give further details.",

The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "At the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn't been able to take by force.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine's military and financial needs over the next two years.",

    "story": [
      "French police on Thursday caught a second inmate who had escaped from prison in late November by sawing through cell bars and using bedsheets, sources close to the case told AFP.",
      "The 19-year-old escapee, suspected in a drug-linked attempted murder case, was found in the southern port city of Marseille after Interpol issued a red notice for him, two sources close to the case told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "He and another detainee had fled an overcrowded jail in the eastern city of Dijon after sawing through their cell bars with blades that investigators suspect were delivered by drone.",
      "Police tracked down the Marseille native some 310 miles south of the prison to a run-down apartment complex in the north of the city, known to be a drug-dealing hotspot.",
      "His fellow fugitive, a 32-year-old man accused of violence against a partner, was arrested a day after their escape, when police officers swooped down on a village bar where he was sipping coffee.",
      "The Dijon public prosecutor's office confirmed Thursday's arrest to AFP, without offering further details.",
      "France has some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe, ranking third worst after Slovenia and Cyprus, according to a Council of Europe report\u00a0published\u00a0in July. In early October, the national average was 135 inmates per 100 places available. Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "\"Old-fashioned\" blades",
      "Guards noticed the two men had fled from the Dijon prison before dawn.",
      "The 32-year-old man had left a message in his cell, saying he had been held for \"too long,\" according to Dijon's public prosecutor, Olivier Caracotch. It was not immediately clear for how long he had been held.",
      "Union official Ahmed Saih, who represents prison officers at the jail, told AFP shortly after the breakout that the inmates used \"old-fashioned, manual saw blades,\" and that several such blades had been found previously.",
      "The saws were likely delivered by drones, Caracotch said following the escape, with several individuals already sentenced over drone deliveries to the same jail.",
      "In early October, French prisons hosted 135 inmates per 100 places available.",
      "The Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "In the week before the breakout, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin announced the Dijon facility was scheduled to receive $7.3 million as part of a program to eradicate mobile phones from six French prisons.",
      "The prison break came less than two weeks after another escape in the northwestern city of Rennes. A 37-year-old convict, who had more than a year left to serve for theft, fled on Nov. 14 during an outing with fellow prisoners to the city's planetarium. He was later caught in the nearby city of Nantes.",
      "Last year, a boss from one of Italy's most violent mafias who escaped from a maximum security prison last year by using bedsheets was captured in France, authorities in both countries said Friday.

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:11:21 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's announcement of plan to sell Taiwan a record $10 billion worth of weapons draws an angry response from China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all.",
      "The tension between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest single economies, has ebbed and flowed during Mr. Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to reunify with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to make that a reality.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"",
      "\"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.",
      "China blasts U.S.-Taiwan arms deals, says they \"will only end up backfiring\"",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\"The 'Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\"This cannot save the doomed fate of 'Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for 'Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\" Guo added.",
      "The U.S. role in Taiwan's \"self-defense capabilities\"",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "President Trump, in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes aired in early November, said Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't bring up the issue of Taiwan when the two leaders met in late October, but he said Xi knew \"the consequences\" of taking military action against the island.",
      "\"He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But they understand what's gonna happen. He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell whether he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if Xi did move militarily on the island, Mr. Trump said, \"I can't give away my secrets.\"",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.",
      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Mr. Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.",
      "The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Mr. Trump is expected to sign Thursday. Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "A French court on Thursday sentenced a doctor to life in jail for\u00a0poisoning 30 child and adult patients, 12 of whom died, reportedly in an attempt to discredit coworkers.",
      "Frederic Pechier, 53, worked as an anesthetist in two clinics in the eastern city of Besancon, when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 and 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.",
      "Pechier's youngest victim, 4-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.",
      "\"You will be incarcerated immediately,\" presiding judge Delphine Thibierge said.",
      "Pechier, who has denied wrongdoing and had not been detained since the start of the probe, appeared unmoved. Members of his family broke down in tears.",
      "A lawyer from the firm representing him, Ornella Spatafora, said he would appeal.",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017, after suspicious cardiac arrests were recorded during operations on patients considered low-risk.",
      "During the more than three-month trial, prosecutors called for Pechier to be jailed for life, saying he \"used medicine to kill.\"",
      "They say he contaminated IV bags with potassium, local anaesthetics, adrenaline, and even an anticoagulant to trigger cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients being treated by colleagues.",
      "His goal, prosecutors said, was to \"psychologically hurt\" caregivers with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power.\"",
      "Pechier had argued during the probe that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "He admitted during the trial that there had been a person poisoning patients in one of the two clinics where he worked, but said it was not him.",
      "\"I am not a poisoner,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News\u00a0reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labeled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "One colleague described Pechier as a very good doctor with an \"oversized ego.\"",
      "Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "In tears during the trial earlier this month, Pechier recounted trying to kill himself in 2021.",
      "The verdict comes after a court in May sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients, most of them children, between 1989 and 2014.",
      "That case raised questions about how he was allowed to continue practicing until retirement despite at least one colleague sounding the alarm.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities investigating the Bondi Beach terrorist attack have been looking into a month-long trip taken by the suspects, father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram, to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week that the attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City said the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel in Davao, told CBS News on Thursday that Sajid and Naveed Akram, the elder of whom was killed during the Sunday attack, checked into the hotel on Nov. 1 and then left on Nov. 28.",
      "He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said there was nothing particularly suspicious about the father and son, who had one piece of luggage and one backpack between them.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC previously reported that the Bondi Beach attackers had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But on Wednesday, Philippine presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said there was \"no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "There has been an Islamist insurgency in the southern Philippines for many years, but the two main militant groups involved are not affiliated with ISIS, Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College, who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "There is a relatively small splinter group called Abu Sayyaf based on a remote archipelago that is affiliated with ISIS, but Smith said it would be very difficult for foreigners to receive weapons training from the group.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Australian and Indian authorities have confirmed that Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, traveled on an India passport, while his son, born in Australia, used an Australian passport.",

    "summary": "From a diaper bank in South Carolina to a community clinic in Florida and a village in India, pregnant women are getting a healthier start thanks to free prenatal multivitamins from Vitamin Angels and its partners. Their stories reveal how targeted nutrition support can help moms carry to term and give babies a stronger beginning.",
    "story": [
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "When Stephanie got pregnant with her first child at age 32, she channeled her limited energy and finances towards things like preparing space in her home and gathering supplies. The task, and cost, of securing and taking prenatal vitamins fell by the wayside.",
      "As an unemployed mom in Columbia, South Carolina, she\u2019s not alone. The state is home to a high number of women of reproductive age who lack health insurance \u2014\u00a0one in eight to be exact \u2014 and even more who don\u2019t have access to proper prenatal care. The effects can be dire, contributing to birth defects, preterm birth, and even infant and maternal death.",
      "But when Stephanie conceived her second child years later at age 41, she had a leg up: Through a local diaper bank called Power in Changing, she received not just diapers, information, support, and other supplies, but also free prenatal vitamins from the global health nonprofit\u00a0Vitamin Angels. Had the supplements not been free, Stephanie said, she likely would have prioritized something else and skipped them once again. That, fortunately, wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\"With this pregnancy, I took the prenatal and I felt good throughout the whole pregnancy with him\u2026I just overall generally feel healthier,\" Stephanie said. Despite being significantly older, she recovered faster from childbirth too. Stephanie\u2019s second child, she added, \"definitely benefited from having a healthy mom and a healthy start. He\u2019s brought a lot of joy to my life.\"",
      "Prenatal vitamins like those provided by Vitamin Angels are more than nice to have:\u00a0Research shows that pregnant women with inadequate nutrition are more likely to experience complications including post-partum hemorrhage and preterm delivery, and their babies are at higher risk of poor cognitive and physical development.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "\"During pregnancy, a woman\u2019s body works overtime to nourish her baby,\" said\u00a0Colleen\u00a0Delaney, PhD, RDN, a researcher and registered dietitian nutritionist who serves as a technical advisor for Vitamin Angels. Simply eating more doesn\u2019t cut it. Moms with so-called \"hidden hunger\" may not lack calories, \"but they are short on the essential vitamins and minerals needed to support their health and their baby\u2019s development,\" Delaney added. \"Prenatal multivitamins are a simple, proven way to meet that need.\"",
      "But social and economic barriers like unemployment and unstable housing can prevent moms-to-be like Stephanie from taking the vitamins regularly. In fact, more than 1 million underserved pregnant women in the US miss out on important prenatal services, including multivitamins and nutrition support.",
      "That\u2019s where Vitamin Angels comes in. Thanks to donations from individuals and corporate partners like the brain supplement brand\u00a0Prevagen (which acts as a philanthropic collaborator and not a prenatal vitamin maker), pregnant women across the country can receive the supplements free of charge. And importantly, the women access them from local providers they already use and trust.",
      "\"Partners like Power in Changing know their community, they know the mothers they serve by name, and they know the support their clients need,\"\u00a0Ana C\u00e9spedes, Vitamin Angels CEO, said. \"We further support their work by giving them more tools \u2014 a proven prenatal multivitamin and nutrition education \u2014 to put into women\u2019s hands when they need it most.\"",
      "From South Carolina to East India",
      "A few states away from Stephanie, a Florida woman named Ty\u2019hara had trouble finding prenatal care options that accepted her Medicaid coverage. But when she discovered Bond Community Health Center, which provides a wide range of health services, she was able to access and take prenatal vitamins from Vitamin Angels diligently.",
      "VitaminAngels.org",
      "While everyone\u2019s experiences and needs are different, and prenatals should be taken as a part of a healthcare provider\u2019s recommended prenatal care plan, Ty\u2019hara valued the healthy foundation they delivered during her pregnancy. The vitamins help the baby\u2019s organs \"function and form correctly,\" she said, \"as well as\u2026helping me with my iron and minerals and all the things that I need to support successful growth for her.\"",
      "Across the globe in India, a mom-to-be named Santoshini took Vitamin Angels supplements to round out her healthy routine. Like many of her neighbors, she got the vitamins free of charge from a program partner that collaborates with the Indian government to offer health education, childcare, immunizations, and more. \"I feel like these supplements help me get through the day without feeling tired,\" Santoshini said. That\u2019s important because, while she was pregnant, she also cared for her active\u00a0two-year-old son.",
      "Indeed, Vitamin Angels\u2019 impact goes far beyond underserved communities in the US to reach more than 74 million women and children annually in 65 countries worldwide. In low-resource areas, problems from insufficient nutrition from pregnancy until a child\u2019s fifth birthday can include additional and irreversible complications like blindness.",
      "But both at home and away, it doesn\u2019t take much to make a big difference. Case in point: A single dollar donation can impact four children;\u00a0$5 dollars reaches 20.",
      "\"Supporting moms during pregnancy is one of the smartest investments you can make,\"\u00a0Scott Minger, Vitamin Angels Chief Development Officer, said. \"For the cost of a few cups of coffee, we can provide a woman with a full course of prenatal multivitamins that help her stay healthy, carry to term, and welcome a stronger, healthier baby.\"",
      "Prevagen\u2019s leadership agrees the investment is well worth it, said Tom Dvorak, Vice President of Sales and Marketing at Quincy Bioscience. \"At Prevagen, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to live a healthy life,\" he said. \"Our partnership with Vitamin Angels allows us to transform that belief into meaningful action by supporting mothers and children with the essential nutrition they need to thrive.\"",

      "PHOENIX \u2013 Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy offered an update on his agency\u2019s work alongside the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in cracking down on an influx of illegal immigrants given a non-domiciled commercial driver's license (CDL) without proper vetting, which has led to several deaths on America\u2019s highways.",
      "Duffy was set to speak this weekend at AmericaFest and also touched on his special friendship with Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk, who was murdered Sept. 10 during an event in Utah.",
      "\"First off, President [Donald] Trump has been a remarkable leader. What he cares about is making government work better, making sure he's implementing the right policies for the American people. Not the rich, not the powerful, but average, everyday Americans,\" Duffy said when asked about the Department of Transportation's (DOT) crackdown on the trucking crisis.",

      "Duffy expanded his efforts, warning Pennsylvania\u2019s PennDOT and other agencies after illegal immigrants captured out of state were found to have non-domiciled CDLs issued by blue state agencies. In PennDOT\u2019s case, an agency official told Fox News Digital a Philadelphia resident named in the sweep had not drawn any red flags in a federal database it used to verify him.",
      "\"As you've seen, Homeland Security focused on the border and illegal migrants in the country. What we found at DOT is a different set of problems,\" Duffy said, adding that too many states have offered licenses to ineligible foreigners.",
      "\"They're not qualified to get a license. And under [former President] Joe Biden's tenure, [former Transportation Secretary] Pete Buttigieg's tenure, millions of people have come into the country. And it seems like states across the country have offered commercial driver licenses to many of those people,\" he said.",
      "AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLED MY DAUGHTER. KATIE AND ILLINOIS ARE BOTH GETTING JUSTICE",

      "He added that DOT has pressed for compliance from problem states, sharing that California has since revoked 17,000 problematic non-domiciled CDL licenses.",
      "On the other side of the country, Duffy said that more than half of the non-domiciled CDLs issued by NYSDOT were \"issued illegally.\"",

      "\"So, we are going to use every resource, every tool that we have at DOT, to make sure that we have the right people on our road that are well qualified, well licensed. That are proficient in the English language to make sure we're maximizing safety.\"",

      "Suggesting the DOT or FAA could receive complaints as they tend to during holiday seasons, Duffy said travelers should remember an important maxim when it comes to his agency\u2019s work.",
      "\"If there's any issue in any of those spaces \u2014whether it's the controllers, the weather, mechanical \u2014 we will slow down traffic or we will stop traffic because we want you to be safe when you travel,\" he said.",

      "Aimee Bock, who founded the Feeding Our Future nonprofit in 2016, used her growing authority to silence dissent, discourage scrutiny from state regulators and cut off operators who refused to comply, prosecutors said.",
      "While other defendants splurged on luxury homes, cars and overseas property, prosecutors said, Bock instead controlled the levers of approval and reimbursement that allowed the scheme to flourish.",
      "One witness even recently described Bock as a \"God\" in how she enforced her authority.

      "For years, Feeding Our Future operated modestly, handling roughly $3 million to $4 million annually in federal child nutrition reimbursements, according to prosecutors.",
      "That trajectory changed abruptly during the COVID-19 pandemic, when emergency rule changes loosened oversight and allowed sponsors to submit claims without normal verification.",

Later filings and sentencing releases described the total impact as closer to $300 million.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on the latest in the fight over the healthcare problem on 'Special Report.'",
      "A bipartisan Obamacare fix remains out of reach in the Senate, for now, and lawmakers can\u2019t agree on who is at fault.",
      "While many agree that the forthcoming healthcare cliff will cause financial pain, the partisan divide quickly devolved into pointing the finger across the aisle at who owns the looming healthcare premium spikes that Americans who use the healthcare exchange will face.",
      "Part of the finger-pointing has yielded another surprising agreement: Lawmakers don\u2019t see the fast-approaching expiration of the Biden-era enhanced Obamacare subsidies as Congress failing to act in time.",
      "\"Obviously, it's not a failure of Congress to act,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital. \"It's a failure of Republicans to act. Democrats are united and wanting to expand subsidies. Republicans want premium increases to go up.\"",
      "Partisan rancor over Obamacare has seeped into how lawmakers view the effect that expiring subsidies will have on their constituents. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., argued that it was a \"life or death\" situation, while Republicans contended that Democrats set up the very cliff they maligned.\u00a0 (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc. via Getty Images)",
      "DEMOCRATS' LAST-MINUTE MOVE TO BLOCK GOP FUNDING PLAN SENDS LAWMAKERS HOME EARLY",
      "Senate Republicans and Democrats both tried, and failed, to advance their own partisan plans to replace or extend the subsidies earlier this month.

      "A report published last month by Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit healthcare think tank, found that Americans who use the credits will see an average increase of 114% in their premium costs.",
      "The increase can vary, depending on how high above the poverty level a person is. The original premium subsidies set a cap at 400% above the poverty level, while the enhanced subsidies, which were passed during the COVID-19 pandemic, torched the cap.",
      "For example, a person 60 years or older making 401% of the poverty level, or about $62,000 per year, would on average see their premium prices double. That number can skyrocket depending on the state. Wyoming clocks in at the highest spike at 421%.",

So they're talking about which parent is going to survive to raise their three kids. The stakes are life and death.\"",
      "Both sides hold opposing views on the solution. Senate Republicans argue that the credits effectively subsidize insurance companies, not patients, by funneling money directly to them, and that the program is rife with fraud.",

      "A major data breach tied to fintech firm Marquis exposed sensitive banking and identity data for hundreds of thousands of people. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What information was stolen in the Marquis cyberattack",
      "According to legally required disclosures filed in Texas, Maine, Iowa, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, hackers accessed a wide range of personal and financial data. Stolen information includes customer names, dates of birth, postal addresses, Social Security numbers and bank account, debit and credit card numbers. The breach dates back to Aug. 14, when attackers gained access through the SonicWall firewall vulnerability. Marquis later confirmed the incident was a ransomware attack.",
      "While Marquis did not publicly name the attackers, the campaign has been widely linked to the Akira ransomware gang. Akira has previously targeted organizations running SonicWall appliances during large-scale exploitation waves. This was not a routine credential leak.",
      "We reached out to Marquis for comment, and a company spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"In August, Marquis Marketing Services experienced a data security incident. Upon discovery, we immediately enacted our response protocols and proactively took the affected systems offline to protect our data and our customers\u2019 information. We engaged leading third-party cybersecurity experts to conduct a comprehensive investigation and notified law enforcement.",
      "\"The incident was quickly contained, and our investigation was recently completed. It was determined that an unauthorized third party accessed certain non-public information within our network. However, there is no evidence indicating that any personal information has been used for identity theft or financial fraud. We have notified potentially affected individuals.",
      "\"We know our customers place great trust in us, and at Marquis, we take that responsibility seriously by making the protection of their information our highest priority. We are extremely appreciative of the cooperation, understanding, and support of our employees and customers during this time.\"",
      "HOW TO STOP IMPOSTOR BANK SCAMS BEFORE THEY DRAIN YOUR WALLET",
      "Why the Marquis data breach creates long-term identity risk",
      "When a data breach exposes your full identity, the danger does not disappear after the news cycle ends. Unlike a stolen password, this kind of information cannot be changed, which means the risk can stick around for a long time.",
      "\"With a typical credential leak, you reset passwords, rotate tokens and move on,\" Ricardo Amper, CEO and Founder of Incode Technologies, a digital identity verification company, tells CyberGuy. \"But core identity data is static. You cannot meaningfully change your date of birth or SSN, and once those are exposed, they can circulate on criminal markets for years. The breach is a moment in time, but the exposure it creates can follow people for the rest of their financial lives.\"",
      "That is why identity breaches are so dangerous. Criminals can reuse the same stolen data years later to open new accounts, build fake identities or run highly targeted scams that feel personal and convincing. Many attackers now combine this data with AI tools to scale their efforts. As a result, phishing emails, phone calls and even voice impersonations are harder to spot when they reference real details about your bank or account history.",
      "The most likely scams after identity data is stolen",
      "When criminals obtain verified identity data, fraud becomes targeted rather than opportunistic.",
      "\"Once criminals get their hands on rich, verified identity data, fraud stops being a guessing game and becomes a targeted execution,\" Amper said.",
      "The first major threat is account takeover. With enough personal details, attackers can bypass knowledge-based checks, reset passwords, change contact information and abuse accounts in ways that often look legitimate. The second risk is new account fraud. This includes credit cards, loans, buy now pay later services and even new bank accounts. High-quality data helps these applications pass automated systems and manual reviews.",
      "The fastest-growing threat is synthetic identity fraud. Real data, like a Social Security number, is blended with fabricated details to create a new identity that matures over time before a large financial bust.",
      "\"These attacks are hard to catch early because the data being presented is accurate and often reused across multiple institutions,\" Amper noted. \"If your defenses can't reliably tell a real human from an AI-generated impersonation, you are starting every decision from a position of disadvantage,\" he added.",
      "Why unpatched firewall flaws pose such a serious threat",
      "Ransomware groups like Akira increasingly focus on widely deployed infrastructure to maximize impact. Firewalls sit at the boundary of trusted networks. When one is compromised, everything behind it becomes reachable.",
      "\"What we're seeing with groups like Akira is a focus on maximizing impact by targeting widely used infrastructure. The strategy remains the same: Find a single weak point that gives access to many downstream victims at once,\" Amper said.",
      "This approach exposes a persistent blind spot in traditional cybersecurity thinking. Many organizations still assume traffic passing through a firewall is safe.",
      "\"When the perimeter device itself is the entry point, static defenses and outdated controls simply can't keep up,\" Amper explained.",
      "Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers and bank details by exploiting an unpatched firewall vulnerability.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How long affected consumers should assume risk remains high",
      "Identity data does not expire. Social Security numbers and birth dates stay the same for life.",
      "\"When core identity data reaches criminal markets, the risk does not fade quickly,\" Amper emphasized. \"Fraud rings treat stolen identity data like inventory. They hold it, bundle it, resell it and combine it with information from new breaches.\"",
      "Warning signs of misuse can be subtle. These include credit inquiries you did not authorize, account recovery alerts from unfamiliar services or phone calls that convincingly mimic a bank's verification process using deepfake voice tools.",
      "\"The most damaging fraud often starts long after the breach is no longer in the news,\" Amper added.",
      "The overlooked impact of identity theft",
      "Financial losses are only part of the damage. Victims often experience a lasting erosion of trust.",
      "Amper says, \"The most overlooked consequence is the psychological toll of knowing that you can no longer trust who is contacting you. Deepfake impersonation turns every phone call, video message or urgent request into a potential attack.\"",
      "Ways to stay safe after the Marquis data breach",
      "When a breach exposes Social Security numbers, bank details and birth dates, the risk does not end with a password reset. These steps focus on protections that reduce long-term identity misuse and help you detect fraud early.",
      "A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name using stolen identity data. This is critical after the Marquis breach, where full identity profiles were exposed. Freezing credit does not affect your score and can be lifted temporarily when needed. Place a free credit freeze with Equifax, Experian and TransUnion online or by phone. Each bureau must be contacted separately. Once frozen, new credit cannot be opened unless you temporarily lift or remove the freeze using a PIN or account login.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. It adds protection if you are not ready to freeze credit everywhere or want an extra layer on top of a freeze. Fraud alerts last for one year and can be renewed. You only need to contact one credit bureau to place a fraud alert. Equifax, Experian or TransUnion will notify the others for you. Fraud alerts are free and last for one year.",
      "Turn on alerts for withdrawal, purchase, login attempts and password changes across all financial accounts. Real-time alerts can help you catch account takeovers or unauthorized activity before serious damage occurs.",
      "Check statements and credit reports often, even months or years after the breach. Identity data from incidents like this is frequently reused later for delayed fraud. Watch for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or small test charges.",
      "Text message codes can be intercepted or socially engineered. Where possible, switch to app-based or hardware-backed two-factor authentication. These options are harder for attackers to bypass, even when they know your personal details.",
      "Biometrics tied to your physical device add a layer that criminals cannot easily replicate. Face and fingerprint authentication help block account takeovers driven by stolen identity data or AI-powered impersonation.",
      "Reputable antivirus software helps detect malicious links, fake login pages and follow-up attacks that target breach victims. This adds protection against phishing and ransomware tied to identity-based scams.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Data brokers collect and resell personal information that can be combined with breach data to fuel targeted fraud. A data removal service reduces how much of your personal information is publicly available and lowers your exposure over time.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Identity theft services monitor credit files, dark web markets and account activity for signs that your stolen data is being misused. Many also offer recovery assistance in the event of fraud, which can save time and stress when dealing with banks, credit bureaus and government agencies. This monitoring is especially useful after breaches like Marquis, where identity data can resurface long after the initial incident.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Marquis data breach highlights how dangerous unpatched infrastructure vulnerabilities have become for the financial sector. When a single vendor holds data for hundreds of institutions, the fallout spreads quickly. For you, identity protection is no longer a one-time response. It is an ongoing necessity that can last years beyond the initial breach.",

      "What fake delivery text messages look like",
      "Most of these fake shipping texts include a \"tracking link\" that looks close enough to the real thing that you might tap without thinking twice about it. In some cases, like one Maryland woman found out, you may even receive\u00a0fake deliveries with a QR code\u00a0that works in a similar way.",
      "These links usually lead to a spoofed tracking page that looks almost identical to the real thing. It'll ask you to \"confirm\" your login or enter your delivery details. The moment you type anything in, scammers capture it and use it to access your real accounts.",
      "Even worse, the \"tracking link\" may contain\u00a0malware\u00a0or\u00a0spyware, triggering silent installs that can steal passwords, monitor keystrokes, or give scammers remote access to your device.",

If Amazon says your package is arriving tomorrow, but a random text says it's delayed or stuck, trust Amazon, not the text.Language that is designed to rush you.

      "I've been very vocal about the importance of keeping personal information under lock and key. And this is just one of the reasons why.",
      "Criminals rely on your personal information to target you with these types of scams. They also need at least a phone number or email address to reach you in the first place.",
      "So your best bet to avoid delivery scams (and, honestly, most other scams year-round) is removing your info from data brokers and people search sites. Doing this will keep your details out of circulation online and out of the wrong hands.",

      "Fraudsters use spoofed shipping pages and malware to capture passwords and gain access to victims\u2019 devices. (Martin Ollman/Getty Images)",
      "How to remove your personal information from scammers' reach",
      "You can start by looking yourself up online. Searching for different combinations of your name, address, email, and phone number should bring up a bunch of people search sites. Just visit the \"opt-out\" page on each site to request removal of your data.",
      "Private-database data brokers are a bit trickier. They sell data in bulk, usually to marketers and other third parties. So you won't be able to check if they have your information. But if you look into which data brokers operate in your area, you can just send opt-out requests to them all. There's a good chance they'll have your information.",
      "You can also turn to a data removal service. They completely remove the headache from this process and just automatically keep your personal info off data broker sites. If, like me, you don't have the time to keep manually checking data broker sites and sending removal requests every few months (because your data will keep reappearing), a personal data removal service is the way to go.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "This season brings joy but also risks for pets. Visitors, travel and loud celebrations create more chances for animals to slip out or feel spooked.

      "What to do if your pet goes missing",
      "Losing a pet can feel overwhelming, but taking fast action helps. These steps guide you through what to do right away.",
      "Look in closets, garages and under furniture. Walk your street and ask neighbors to check yards and sheds.",
      "Take a clear photo and post it on the site. AI photo matching alerts you when a possible match appears. It also helps others contact you fast.",
      "Shelters update kennels throughout the day. Staff can guide you and help flag your pet's profile. Go often until you get updates.",
      "Use neighborhood apps, local Facebook groups and community forums. Include your pet's photo, last known location and your contact info.",
      "Use a large photo and simple details. Place flyers at busy intersections and near schools, parks and businesses.",

      "How AirTags can help you find a lost pet faster",
      "While tools like AI photo matching are invaluable after a pet goes missing, prevention and real-time tracking can make an enormous difference during the first critical hours. That's where Apple AirTags come in. An AirTag isn't a GPS tracker, but it can still be a powerful recovery tool when used correctly. When attached securely to your pet's collar, an AirTag uses Apple's vast Find My network. That network consists of hundreds of millions of nearby iPhones, iPads and Macs that can anonymously and securely relay the AirTag's location back to you.",
      "If your pet wanders into a neighborhood, apartment complex or busy area, the chances are high that another Apple device will pass nearby and update the location automatically. You won't know who helped, and they won't know it was them, but the location can show up on your map within minutes. For indoor cats or dogs that don't usually roam far, this can be especially helpful. Even a rough location can narrow your search area and save precious time.",
      "Important limits to know: AirTags work best in populated areas. They rely on nearby Apple devices, so coverage may be limited in rural or remote locations. They also don't update continuously like true GPS pet trackers. That's why AirTags should be seen as a backup layer, not a replacement for microchipping or dedicated pet trackers.",
      "How to use an AirTag safely with pets",
      "Use a\u00a0secure, pet-specific AirTag holder that won't break easily.Attach it to a\u00a0breakaway collar\u00a0for cats and dogs to reduce injury risk.Make sure\u00a0Find My notifications are turned on so you get alerts quickly.Combine it with\u00a0microchipping and ID tags for the best protection.",

This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions. Early backers on its global crowdfunding campaign are already pushing the project toward major funding goals.",

IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",
      "In 2022, LastPass confirmed that an unauthorized party accessed parts of its customer information through a third-party cloud storage service. While the incident initially raised alarms, the long-term impact has taken time to fully surface.",
      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",
      "Users have a right to expect that companies handling sensitive data take every reasonable step to protect it.",
      "Breaches may be inevitable, but weak safeguards are not.",
      "LastPass on the UK data breach",

    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts, and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide - free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons reported 479 drone incidents at federal prisons in 2024, a substantial rise from 23 incidents in 2018. Unlike the federal government, states cannot shoot down a drone or jam its radio frequencies.",
      "Joel Anderson, director of South Carolina's Department of Corrections, said his team is leading the nation in developing drone detection systems. South Carolina reported 262 drone incursions over its prisons in 2022, up from 69 in 2019.",

      "Anderson has watched drone smuggling missions become more elaborate in recent years. When smugglers first went airborne, he said drones only carried about four pounds and reached a top speed of 45 miles per hour. Now, massive heavy-lift drones traveling more than 75 miles per hour are hauling 25-pound duffle bags of contraband over prison fences.",

      "Most of the criminal drone pilots are former inmates who already have connections inside and know the layout of the facility. Many inmates contact them with illegal cellphones obtained in prison.",
      "Most of the time, Anderson said drone pilots will try to camouflage their payloads, making it harder to spot from a distance.",
      "\"If they're lying on the grass out there, say, on a green day during the summer months, a lot of times they'll take duct tape and put grass on it and lay it across the yard,\" Anderson said. \"It's not easy to see from here.

      "Currently, detection and confiscation is all states can do when a drone flies over its prison. The Federal Aviation Administration prohibits states from bringing down drones because they are considered registered aircraft.",
      "Anderson agreed that shooting down a drone could be dangerous for people inside and outside the prison because they often carry deadly drugs.",
      "\"We picked up enough fentanyl, one institution to kill the entire prison system one time. Four hundred and sixty-four grams of fentanyl in one bag with one drone,\" Anderson said. \"We would hate to disable a drone, and it flies off into a subdivision somewhere, and then we don't know where it is.\"",

      "\"I applaud our staff for being as steadfast as they are. They're good at what they do,\" Anderson said. \"I'd much rather be using them in the living areas, watching inmates, than running around out here chasing illegal packages, because a lot of it is caused by these illegal cell phones that we have that give them direct communication with their counterparts outside the fences.\"",

      "In written testimony submitted to the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control for an Oct. 21 hearing, Billingslea traced the island\u2019s transformation back more than two decades. Under Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, he wrote, Venezuela \"opened its doors to Hezbollah, allowing the group to establish a major footprint, including a paramilitary training site, on Margarita Island.\"",
      "\"When Nicol\u00e1s Maduro seized power,\" Billingslea added, \"the breadth and depth of Hezbollah\u2019s presence in Venezuela dramatically expanded, as did their ties to the narco-terrorist regime and the Cartel de los Soles.\"",

      "\"The relationship is very close with the Cartel de los Soles, and it has been so for many, many years,\" Billingslea said, referring to the network of senior Venezuelan officials accused by the United States of drug trafficking.",
      "Billingslea said Hezbollah has embedded itself into Margarita Island\u2019s economy, exploiting the island\u2019s duty-free status and cross-border access to Colombia to generate revenue through smuggling and drug importation. He said the group operates a wide range of companies on the island and also maintains several training camps there.",
      "His testimony also detailed how Venezuela\u2019s state apparatus helped embed Hezbollah inside the country. He wrote that former senior official Tareck El Aissami, while overseeing Venezuela\u2019s passport and naturalization agency, \"was instrumental in furnishing passports and citizenship documents to Hezbollah operatives as well as a large number of people from Lebanon, Syria, and Iran.\" Between 2010 and 2019, Venezuelan authorities issued more than 10,400 passports to individuals from those countries, according to the testimony.",

The filing also describes a subsequent weapons delivery at a hangar controlled by Maduro at the country\u2019s main international airport.",
      "Recent developments in the Middle East have only increased Margarita Island\u2019s importance, Billingslea said. Israel\u2019s campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon has damaged the group\u2019s military leadership and financial infrastructure, forcing it to rely more heavily on overseas networks.",
      "\"Israeli successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon in particular, including their strikes on the financial infrastructure Al-Qard al-Hassan that operates in Lebanon, are going to have two effects,\" he said. \"The first is that it is making the fundraising and the revenue generation that comes out of Latin America even more important to the terrorist group. Secondly, we have seen indications that Hezbollah actually has been relocating fighters from Lebanon, several hundred from Lebanon to Venezuela in particular.\"",

      "Asked whether that shift moves the threat closer to the United States, Billingslea said Hezbollah is now operating \"close to the U.S. and further away from the Israelis.\"",
      "He said Iran\u2019s role in Venezuela has deepened alongside Hezbollah\u2019s. \"There is a substantial Iranian footprint in Venezuela related to the trade of weapons and drones, in particular, for gold,\" he said. After suffering losses in the Middle East, he added, \"the Iranians find themselves even more dependent on that supply of gold in exchange for drones and weapons.\"",

I believe the Venezuelan opposition possesses a great deal of that intelligence, though it is not clear to me that the United States government is making the best use of that access.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior correspondent Rich Edson joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 with details on President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming national address and his move to designate Nicolas Maduro's regime as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "For years, Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has defied predictions of collapse. Sanctions, diplomatic isolation and internal unrest have failed to unseat him. But the latest escalation by the Trump administration \u2014 including the seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker and the enforcement of a blockade on sanctioned vessels \u2014 has hit the regime where it is most vulnerable: its oil trade.",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that while the timeline and outcome remain uncertain, the regime\u2019s dependence on oil leaves it uniquely vulnerable. \"One thing is clear: the Maduro regime can\u2019t sustain itself without oil revenue,\" she said.",
      "While the U.S. move has raised concerns among European allies, who warned that the escalation could undermine regional stability and complicate efforts toward a political resolution in Venezuela, Ford Maldonado says the administration\u2019s approach is striking at the core of Maduro\u2019s power.",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing now with President Trump\u2019s order for a total blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela is a direct hit against Maduro\u2019s revenue streams,\" she said. \"He needs the oil money from these tankers to buy loyalty and pay off generals, cartel partners and political enforcers to stay in power. That pipeline is finally being cut.\"",

      "According to Reuters, up to 11 million barrels of Venezuelan crude are currently stranded aboard 39 tankers anchored offshore.",
      "Jorge Jraissati, president of the Economic Inclusion Group, said the recent U.S. actions \"fundamentally change the economics of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports.",
      "\"That oil is neither sold nor paid for,\" Jraissati said. \"Until those cargoes move, they generate no cash flow for PDVSA and deepen Maduro\u2019s liquidity strain.\" PDVSA is Venezuela's state-run oil company.",
      "Venezuela is one of the most oil-dependent countries on Earth. Oil accounts for more than 80% of exports and roughly 90% of government revenue, leaving the nation extraordinarily exposed when crude shipments falter.",
      "\"After years of economic collapse as a result of Venezuela\u2019s socialist policies, virtually all other sectors of the economy are bankrupted,\" Jraissati noted.",

      "U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan oil have been in place since 2019, but enforcement often lagged, and PDVSA continued to move crude through intermediaries and opaque trading networks, mainly toward Asia. The recent tanker seizure appears to have changed that dynamic.",
      "The Trump administration said the seized vessel was headed for Cuba, but Jraissati argued China was the more likely destination. \"Tankers of that size are typically deployed on long-haul routes, and China accounts for roughly 60% percent of Venezuela\u2019s oil exports,\" he said.",
      "Not only has crude become harder to sell, it has become cheaper. Venezuelan heavy crude is trading at discounts of up to $21 per barrel below Brent, according to sources cited by Jraissati and confirmed by Reuters reporting.",

      "Oil tankers, with cargoes worth tens of millions of dollars, now face heightened risk if they enter Venezuelan waters. This has sent buyers and shipowners scrambling for insurance and new terms.",
      "\"In general terms, this is a game-changing policy because it fundamentally alters the economics of exporting oil from Venezuela,\" Jraissati said. \"Exports will not stop, but the conditions under which they are sold will deteriorate sharply. It will weaken Maduro\u2019s cash flow.\"",

      "On Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres warned that Yemen was facing a dangerous new escalation following recent advances by forces affiliated with the STC in the eastern governorates of Hadramawt and al-Mahra. Guterres said such unilateral actions risk deepening divisions, hardening positions and accelerating fragmentation, with potential spillover effects on regional security, including the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Horn of Africa.",
      "Bridget Toomey, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that for the U.S. to support southern secession would be \"at odds with the stated policy of the internationally recognized government of Yemen, which currently exists for one Yemen.\" She said the United States supports that government, but added that backing the STC as a partner in counterterrorism missions and in the fight against the Houthis \"would not necessarily be at odds with the government,\" particularly because the STC and its leadership are part of the current governing framework.",
      "Country split in two",
      "Yemen\u2019s war has long divided the nation. In the north, the Houthis rule Sanaa and much of western Yemen with support from Iran and ties to Hezbollah. In the south, STC-aligned forces dominate Aden, the temporary capital, and a belt of inland and coastal regions that include Lahj, Abyan, Shabwa, Hadramout and al-Mahra.",
      "The internationally recognized Yemeni government, which the United States continues to support, is formally based in Aden but remains fragmented. The Saudi-backed Presidential Leadership Council serves as the recognized authority and has relied heavily on a coalition of competing factions, including the STC, to govern and confront the Houthis and to maintain control on the ground.",
      "Toomey said, \"The government has faced serious economic, oversight and capacity challenges and has struggled to deliver basic services, a situation compounded by the ongoing fight against the Houthis and Yemen\u2019s broader humanitarian crisis.\"",
      "In this Jan. 3, 2017 file photo, tribesmen loyal to Houthi rebels chant slogans during a gathering aimed at mobilizing more fighters into battlefronts to fight pro-government forces. (AP)",
      "That reliance has drawn criticism. Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government has accused STC-affiliated forces of carrying out deadly attacks in Hadramout and warned that the group\u2019s recent expansion risks sparking conflict between rival factions within the anti-Houthi camp. The Associated Press reported that Yemeni officials urged the STC to withdraw from areas seized in the east, cautioning that unilateral moves could undermine the political process and destabilize a fragile balance in the south.",
      "Atef rejected that characterization, describing the Hadramout operation as a major success that demonstrated the STC\u2019s ability to fight what he called hostile forces operating in coordination with the Houthis. He accused those forces of collaborating with \"Houthi terrorists\" and said the STC\u2019s actions strengthened security rather than undermined it.",

As long as the Houthis maintain control of Sanaa, he warned, they will \"continue threatening maritime traffic in the Red Sea, continue threatening us in the South and Saudi Arabia, and continue threatening the UAE and the Gulf region.\"",
      "He also accused Houthi factions of cooperation with outside extremist groups, including Somalia\u2019s al-Shabab, and of receiving training and support from Iran and Hezbollah.",

      "Separatists seek deeper partnership with Washington",

Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., who represents a competitive district in the Hudson Valley. \u201cIt\u2019s just pathetic. The last time there was a major national Republican effort to repeal the ACA, we had an overwhelming wave where they got absolutely wiped out, and I think that\u2019s likely what will happen here again.\u201d",
      "Before the House left town, four swing-district Republicans made a late scramble to revive the issue, successfully teaming up with Democrats on a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d to force a vote on a three-year extension of Affordable Care Act funds. That vote is expected in the week of Jan. 5 when the House returns to session.",
      "Republican Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, Rob Bresnahan, Ryan Mackenzie, all of Pennsylvania, as well as Mike Lawler of New York, joined 214 Democratic signatories to end-run Johnson, who has called for letting the enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "\u201cI do believe if the bill comes to the floor, not only will it pass, but it\u2019ll give the Senate the ability to come back with a bipartisan compromise and actually get something passed into law,\u201d Lawler said Wednesday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press Now.\u201d",
      "GOP leaders say they want to end the Covid-era funds, which were first passed by Democrats in 2021 on a party-line basis. Many Republicans want the money to elapse on schedule, but others say they're open to a temporary extension if paired with limitations or a phase-out.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way it\u2019s going to sail through,\u201d said retiring Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., an early proponent of extending the funding who opposes doing so for a full three years absent reforms. \u201cI would expect the vote count if it were just purely this wouldn\u2019t be probably the same as it was last week.\u201d",
      "The Senate voted down the three-year ACA funding extension last Thursday on a vote of 51-48, with four Republicans joining Democrats \u2014 far short of the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster.",
      "Even centrist Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who has long broken with her party on the ACA, declined to endorse the House bill that\u2019s headed to a vote, even if it were to pass the chamber.",

      "She said House passage of the bill would help \u201ckeep momentum going,\u201d but added: \u201cI think we need a bill that also has some reforms, such as an income cap, to just give you an example.\u201d",

      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",
      "Israeli officials and some Jewish organizations, however, argue the term carries an inherent call to violence against Israel and that it functions as antisemitic incitement, a dispute that has increasingly led to policing decisions.",
      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack. A rabbi and a Holocaust survivor were among those killed in the Sydney terror attack, which officials said was intended to directly target the Jewish community.",
      "In a joint statement after the attack, London and Manchester's law enforcement agencies said: \u201cViolent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\u201d",
      "The British police forces also referenced an attack at a synagogue in Manchester earlier this year, where two people were killed on Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish calendar.",
      "Hundreds of people, many of them elderly, according to British Home Office data, have already been arrested at protests in recent months across the U.K. for showing support for Palestine Action, a group that was banned under British terrorism laws after staging actions targeting military facilities and defense firms. The British government said, without providing evidence, that the group had shown willingness \"to use violence in pursuit of its cause.\"",
      "While major Jewish groups have welcomed last week's changes and proposals in the U.K. and Australia, some analysts and opponents of the new measures warn that governments are responding to security fears by collapsing political speech into criminal conduct.",
      "Index on Censorship, a U.K.-based organization advocating for free expression, said police and prosecutors will need to demonstrate that the words \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d are \u201charmful in and of themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere meaning is genuinely ambiguous, we always argue that the criminal law should tread carefully,\u201d it said in a statement Friday.",
      "Marji Mansfield, 69, a retired financial consultant and grandmother of seven, was carried away in handcuffs by police officers at demonstrations in July and November in London, and faces terrorism charges for expressing support for Palestine Action.",
      "She said she hasn't heard 'globalize the intifada' chanted at rallies, but denied the slogan was an incitement to violence, calling it \"a call for liberation\" amid Israel's ongoing occupation of Gaza.",
      "\"It seems bizarre that our government and the government in Australia are seeking to criminalize words that are saying, 'stop these illegal international crimes against humanity',\" she told NBC News.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, warned in July that some measures in the U.K. limiting pro-Palestinian protests appear \"at odds with the U.K.\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\"",
      "Freedom of expression \u201chas always been vital, but it\u2019s never been absolute,\" said Mark Stephens, co-chair of the International Bar Association\u2019s Human Rights Institute. \"We've always drawn a line at incitement to violence, and so that principle has to adapt in more volatile climates.\"",
      "The difficulty authorities face, Stephens told NBC News, is that they are taking slogans and criminalizing them \"on the grounds that it threatens public safety and the state has a duty to act, but that is an area where reasonable people can and do differ.\"",
      "From a police perspective \"it's becoming a bit of a game of Whac-A-Mole,\" he added. \"If you can't say 'globalize the intifada,' someone will come up with something else which isn't illegal, and that becomes the new phrase du jour.\"",
      "In Australia, the additional legislation on protests has also sparked debate over how far authorities should go in policing political expression.",
      "\u201cFor two years, people have paraded in our streets and universities calling for the intifada to be globalized, a catchphrase which means kill Jews wherever you find them,\" David Ossip, the president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, said last week.",
      "Some Jewish groups have opposed the move. The Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that advocates for \"Palestinian freedom,\" said Thursday in a statement that \"policy which points towards universities, the protest movement and migration as the problem will only lead to more demonization.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 20 Dec 2025 10:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "The massive pile of legislation that came across the California governor's desk in 2025 could help form the basis of a future national platform.",
    "story": [
      "It was a big year for California Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "The potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender launched a podcast, emerged as one of the most prominent opponents of President Donald Trump and led the fight from the left on redistricting, countering Republican efforts to gain an advantage ahead of next year\u2019s midterms.",
      "And in a more under-the-radar fashion, Newsom oversaw a deep portfolio of legislation this year that could form the basis of a future national platform.",
      "Across 2025, Newsom signed 794 bills he received from California\u2019s Democratic-dominated Legislature into law, while vetoing another 123. While Newsom particularly championed the measure that led to a redrawing of the state\u2019s congressional map, the vast majority of these pieces of legislation did not grab national attention. But this stack of more than 900 bills helps to illustrate how he\u2019s sought to make appeals to various factions of the Democratic Party \u2014 both in his state and across the country.",
      "He attempted to tackle his state\u2019s housing crisis, enacted measures designed to lower prices, including on energy and prescription drugs, and implemented immigrant protections \u2014 moves that were praised by progressives. He also scaled back health care coverage for undocumented immigrants, boosted fossil fuel production and pushed for the dismantling of homeless encampments \u2014 moves that were viewed as shifts to the center.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s threading the needle. But it\u2019s also that he swings at every pitch,\u201d explained Ted Lempert, a former Democratic Assemblyman in California who now teaches political science at the University of California-Berkeley. \u201cAnd when you do that, yes there\u2019s potential to strike out, which he\u2019s not. For him, it\u2019s about making contact. It\u2019s about doing a little bit in a whole lot of different areas.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of what you\u2019re seeing in his governorship is \u2014 unlike some other governors and presidents, where they focus on one or two main issues \u2014 he\u2019s jumped around a lot,\u201d Lempert added. \u201cAnd a lot of it is not necessarily ideological.\u201d",
      "Democratic strategists and advocacy groups have largely lauded Newsom\u2019s 2025 legislative record as he\u2019s sought to straddle the divide between his party\u2019s progressive and centrist wings. But they also said there could be risk for Newsom in not attempting to carve out a more narrow lane or identity ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a wide-open 2028 Democratic presidential primary.",
      "Still, the flurry of legislative activity could serve as a differentiating factor for Newsom. Prospective White House contenders who are Democratic governors in battleground or red states have been forced to deal with split governments, slowing the pace of legislation. Those who currently serve in Congress or are out of office have little to no recent legislative record to point to.",
      "Other blue-state governors who are seen as harboring presidential ambitions, such as JB Pritzker of Illinois and Wes Moore of Maryland, could also point to a robust list of legislative accomplishments.",
      "But Newsom in particular, as the leader of the biggest blue state in the country, has largely sought to wield that power to make inroads across the party, which continues to search for identity following a bruising 2024 loss.",
      "\u201cHe has always been skilled at the give and take,\u201d said Marva Diaz, a Sacramento-based Democratic strategist and the publisher of the nonpartisan election guide California Target Book. \u201cHe has taken things away from the left that they care about and given them something else.\u201d",
      "Focusing on housing and affordability",
      "While splashy, progressive policies related to expanding the social safety net and protecting the environment dominated the earlier years of Newsom\u2019s tenure, housing and affordability have been at the forefront in 2025.",
      "He signed major bills that streamline housing development regulation \u2014 part of a broader push to tackle the state\u2019s alarming housing shortage \u2014 including allowing taller and denser buildings to be built near transit stations and allowing developers to skip over stringent environmental reviews. Other laws make it easier for homeowners to rent out parts of their home to new tenants and penalize so-called \u201cslow-growth\u201d cities in the state.",
      "Affordability has also been a major theme in 2025. Newsom signed bills enacting $60 billion in refunds for electricity bills, expanding existing affordable child care (including free summer school programs) and paid family leave for many more Californians. He also took actions to keep on track his earlier enacted plans to create free universal preschool for 4-year olds. He kept his foot on the gas on lowering pharmaceutical drug prices. Most notably, he added insulin and naloxone to the landmark program, CalRx, he created during his first term allowing the state to sell pharmaceuticals directly to patients.",
      "And on top of all that, Newsom signed bills implementing protections for immigrants being targeted by federal enforcement agencies.",
      "Democrats across the party have praised these legislative wins. Many painted them as part of the party\u2019s mostly sustained focus on affordability issues throughout the year \u2014 an approach that paid off with a slate of victories around the country in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a continued trend this year of blue states, including with Gov. Newsom and his legislative majority, delivering more on responsive policies that are really about more immediate needs of constituents,\u201d said Mandara Meyers, the executive director of The States Project, a Democratic-aligned group that works to build the party\u2019s power in state legislatures \u201cThat is the opportunity \u2014 for him and for others: How do you do the incredibly popular things that are also deeply salient and really resonate with what people are feeling and experiencing right now.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Newsom\u2019s 123 vetoes paint a few patterns, as well. According to an analysis by CalMatters, his veto messages most frequently cited as reasons behind his actions: fiscal restraint, redundancy and blaming Trump for having created a hostile political and economic environment for certain policies.",
      "A shift to the center on hot-button issues",
      "If Newsom\u2019s earlier years as governor were about expanding the social safety net and setting lofty goals on health care and the environment, his 2025 session has been more about acknowledging their limits.",
      "Most notable in this basket was his state budget move to scale back health care benefits for undocumented immigrants. Newsom painted the action \u2014 a stark reversal of his earlier promises of universal health care for all, regardless of their immigration status \u2014 as necessary to help balance California\u2019s overextended budget. (Newsom\u2019s earlier expansion of the state Medicaid system, called Medi-Cal, has cost far more than his administration anticipated; though his action also came as congressional Republicans advanced a bill to slash Medicaid funding for states.)",
      "In addition, as part of his broader housing agenda, Newsom took significant actions to push cities and localities to clear homeless encampments.",
      "On the energy front, Newsom signed bills that helped boost in-state oil production, mostly by streamlining drilling permit processes. While the move \u2014 intended to help fight high gas prices \u2014 does not come at the expense of the state continuing to meet Newsom\u2019s own ambitious climate and emissions goals, it was nonetheless a major shift in policy, and was roundly criticized by environmental groups. He also stopped plans to decommission a nuclear plant and some gas plants, citing the possibility of power shortages in the energy-hungry state if they went offline, which also angered many progressives and environmental groups.",
      "Throughout his two terms as governor, Newsom has also regularly fought off efforts to raise taxes on California\u2019s most wealthy residents. That most recently included his opposition to a so-called \u201cbillionaire tax\u201d \u2014 a move championed by many progressive groups. Supporters of that policy have since pivoted to put it directly to voters in a ballot measure in November 2026.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to some of the policy priorities this year, it\u2019s a bit of a mixed bag,\u201d said Ida Eskamani, a senior director on economic issues at the State Innovation Exchange, a progressive state legislative policy group. \u201cLike, what is the model you seek for the country that will inspire folks to want to be engaged in the government and in the governing process?\u201d",
      "She praised Newsom over his insulin move and the \u201cinnovation\u201d of CalRx but also called his health care rollback \"Trump lite.\u201d",
      "\u201cClearly he\u2019s trying to walk a fine line policy-wise. And inherently the contradictions are showing,\u201d Eskamani said. \u201cYou have to just be really steadfast about your values and who you\u2019re fighting for,\u201d she continued, because during a primary campaign, \u201cfolks are going to ultimately ask, \u2018What do you stand for and whose side are you on?\u2019\u201d",
      "'The Gavin brand'",
      "Newsom has painted his legislative record as part of a \u201cpragmatic\u201d approach needed to solve major financial problems in his state. But he  has also suggested it\u2019s the sort of framework that could help form a \u201cbig tent\u201d Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cI want it to be the Manchin to Mamdani party,\u201d Newsom said in an interview with Politico published last month, referring to former West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat-turned-independent, and New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic socialist.",
      "Newsom, through a spokesperson, declined to provide comment for this article.",
      "In remarks Newsom has delivered after enacting various laws that don\u2019t clearly align with progressive values, he has often talked about the importance of working toward practical goals over ideological ones.",
      "\u201cThis is not an ideological endeavor. We\u2019re in the practical application business. We\u2019ve got to manifest our ideals and our goals, and so this lays it out, but it lays it out without laying tracks over folks,\u201d Newsom said in September at an event to sign the bill that boosted oil production.",
      "When it came to scaling back health care for undocumented immigrants, he painted his move as a \u201ccorrective action\u201d to \u201clevel set on what we can do and what we can\u2019t do.\u201d",
      "Newsom has also said Democrats must be \u201cmore culturally normal\u201d and has split with progressives by opposing trans athletes competing in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Newsom\u2019s broader approach has earned pushback from some progressives who say they are tired of compromising with those to their right politically.",
      "\u201cWho is he being pragmatic towards?\u201d Eskamani asked. \u201cThe legislative and elected leaders in our network don\u2019t talk about what they can\u2019t do. They talk about what we can build together. And that is what the public wants. They want leaders who are going to fight to make things better, not leaders who are going to compromise because it\u2019s too hard or who are trying to be pragmatic.\u201d",
      "But those who have followed his decadeslong career in California say Newsom has long prioritized personality over ideology.",
      "\u201cHis persona is not, and has never been, I am this hardcore insert-brand-here kind of politician,\u201d Lempert said. \u201cHe\u2019s hard to pin down. He\u2019s doing a lot of different things. At the same time, he\u2019s not out there saying, \u2018I\u2019m a conservative Democrat,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m a progressive Democrat.\u2019 It\u2019s just sort of the Gavin brand.\u201d"

      "When Millie is first hired as the housemaid for the Winchester family, she thinks she landed the perfect job. Her tasks include cleaning up the home and taking care of the family's seemingly spoiled daughter, Cece (Indiana Elle). She is given a room in the attic to live in, even though the door strangely locks from the outside and has one tiny window that can't be opened.",
      "After her first night sleeping at the house, Millie wakes up to find the kitchen a wreck, with Nina throwing dishes onto the ground and screaming. Nina is only able to calm down when her husband, Andrew, runs into the kitchen and wraps her in a hug.",

      "Amid Nina's crazy behaviors, Millie builds a relationship with Andrew, who understands the way Nina functions. Their relationship quickly escalates from platonic to sexual when they end up going to New York City to see a play together, and spend the night at a hotel room.",

      "Andrew proceeds to lock Millie in her attic room and forces her to cut herself in the stomach with the pieces of the broken plate as a punishment.",
      "The point of view of the film suddenly shifts from Millie's perspective to Nina's perspective. The story goes back in time to recount when single mother Nina first met Andrew and had a quick engagement and wedding. Andrew always wanted a child of their own but as viewers discover, there's a reason Nina didn't want to get pregnant.",

      "Andrew gets upset with Nina for not keeping up the roots of her bleached blond hair and locks her in the attic room. He says that she has to repent for making a mistake and forces her to pull 100 strands of hair out of her head and place them in an envelope in order to be let out of the room.",
      "Nina remains trapped in the room for days without access to food or water. In a feverish state, she finally gives in and completes the punishment.",
      "For years, Nina was forced to deal with the abuse. She feared Cece would be taken away from her if she tried to leave Andrew, as everyone believes he is the perfect husband and she is the crazy wife.",
      "However, Nina comes up with a plan to hire a housemaid, Millie, a pretty young girl with a history of violence to steal Andrew's attention. She knows that Andrew will be attracted to her and would take care of her \u2014 just like he did with Nina.",
      "How Does \u2018The Housemaid\u2019 End?",

In \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d viewers get to meet the Mangkwan clan, also known as the Ash People, who are led by their wicked leader Varang, played by Oona Chaplin.",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 4\u2019 Be Released?",
      "The year delay in the release of \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d pushed back the release dates of the franchise\u2019s final two movies, Deadline reported in June 2023.",
      "\u201cAvatar 4,\u201d which was originally scheduled for a December 2026 release, will now arrive in theaters in December 2029, according to Deadline.",
      "But, as Cameron told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published this week, he hopes the just-released \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d is another box-office smash in order for him to continue with the franchise.",
      "Still, Cameron shared tidbits about the script of \u201cAvatar 4\u201d with Entertainment Weekly way back in 2022, revealing that the movie would feature \u201ca big time jump\u201d to accommodate how much the franchise\u2019s younger actors have aged in real life.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re young men, young women at that point, when we get to the B side of that time jump,\u201d he said.",
      "During a 2023 appearance on \u201cWho\u2019s Talking to Chris Wallace,\u201d Cameron confirmed he\u2019d already begun working on both final films.",
      "\u201c\u2018Avatar 4\u2019 and \u20185\u2019 are both written. We even have some of \u20184\u2019 in the can,\u201d said Cameron.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve begun a franchise at this point,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe can safely say we\u2019ve begun a saga that can now play out over multiple films, which was our original goal.\u201d",
      "When Wallace asked if Cameron already knew the final scene of the entire franchise, Cameron responded, \u201cOh yeah. It\u2019s all been written. The scripts for 2, 3, 4 and 5 were all finished over five years ago. It\u2019s all mapped out.\u201d",
      "When Will \u2018Avatar 5\u2019 Be Released?",

      "How Will the 'Avatar' Story End?",

      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to talk about it, but I\u2019ve now subsequently heard that Jim (Cameron) has talked about it a little bit,\u201d Landau said. \u201cIn movie five there is a section of the story where we go to Earth. And we go to it to open people\u2019s eyes, open Neytiri\u2019s eyes, to what exists on Earth.\u201d",

      "\u201cOn our first date, he literally had to explain football as if it were, like, violent chess,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWhich helps me kind of understand it. Like high-speed, angry chess. And then I just sort of became obsessed with him and therefore became obsessed with learning about football. Greatest surprise of my life.\u201d",

      "While reflecting on her romantic life before Kelce, Swift said she always struggled to balance her relationships with her career. However, the dynamic changed when she met Kelce.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I thought I\u2019d ever meet a guy who had that same (career) trajectory. And I realized that with this person in my life that just was the right fit for me. You can have the two passions coexist and they actually fuel each other,\u201d she said."

      "The humans and Quaritch are also on the hunt for Jake, who eventually surrenders to them when his family is in danger and after they have captured Spider.

      "An injured, healing and angry Neytiri infiltrates the RDA\u2019s facilities to rescue Jake. She is successful thanks to the help of Spider, who broke out of his cell, and marine biologist Dr. Ian Garvin (Jemaine Clement), who is against the humans killing Tulkun.",

The Ash People come in handy when the big war rages.",
      "When they get back to the Metkayina clan, Jake rallies up as many Na\u2019vi to fight and save their people and all the innocent Tulkun. In the process, many get injured and Jake and Neytiri\u2019s children \u2014 Lo\u2019ak, Kirk, Tuk (Trinity Jo-Li Bliss) \u2014 as well as Spider, take matters into their own hands.",
      "During the fight, pregnant Ronal (Kate Winslet) dies, but not before delivering her baby and asking Neytiri to take care of her baby girl.",

      "Jake \u2014 who has been fighting alongside the Great Leonopteryx, the dragon-like warrior \u2014 then gets into a one-on-one battle with Quaritch on the floating islands. At one point, Spider is thrown into the middle of their fight. He slips and is at risk of falling to his death. Quaritch attempts to save him but also puts himself in danger \u2014 and Jake helps save them both. The encounter seems to draw them all to a truce.",
      "When Neytiri, her children and Tsireya (Bailey Bass) arrive to help defeat Quaritch, Jake tells them to stop. However, Quaritch jumps off the floating island and into an inferno below. It sure doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019d survive that, but \u201cAvatar\u201d fans know that guy has a thousand lives.",

But they weren\u2019t dramatic \u2014 \u201cnothing that made me think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve got to run to a doctor right now,\" he said. Still, he made an appointment and asked for a colonoscopy.",

      "Whatever comes his way, he\u2019s focusing on his faith.",
      "\u201cBefore cancer, God was something I tried to fit into my life as much as possible. After cancer, I feel like a connection to God, whatever that is, is kind of the whole point of this exercise on this planet,\u201d Van Der Beek said.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer whose legal name is Jason Deford has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued the pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "Jelly Roll's convictions include robbery and drug felonies. He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without filling out burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "Jelly Roll and Lee meet at the governor's mansion",
      "Lee said he never met Jelly Roll until Thursday, when the musician visited the governor's mansion over the pardon news. The two hugged in front of a lit Christmas tree and a fireplace decorated with holiday garlands.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a Tennessee pardon serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence. Pardons offer a path to restoring certain civil rights such as the right to vote, although there are some legal limitations, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations.",
      "Much of his music deals with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" about someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "\"When I first started doing this, I was just telling my story of my broken self,\" he told The Associated Press in an interview. \"By the time I got through it, I realized that my story was the story of many. So now I'm not telling my story anymore. I'm getting to pull it right from the crevices of the people whose story's never been told.\"",
      "Jelly Roll: 'I was a part of the problem'",
      "Before the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, calling music a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Outside of sold-out shows, he's testified before the U.S. Senate about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were quickly arrested. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Sheriff whose jail held Jelly Roll urged a pardon",
      "Friends and civic leaders cited his transformation in backing a pardon.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "\"I think he has a chance and is in the process of rehabilitating a generation, and that's not just words,\" Hall said in a phone interview Thursday. \"I'm talking about what I see we need in our country, is people who accept responsibility, accept the fact that they make mistakes and accept the fact that they need help.\"",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represented Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor."

      "1st  Immunity Challenge",
      "After Soph found an advantage in the jungle to help her in the Immunity Challenge, she learned from Probst at the challenge that half of her puzzle pieces were already placed in the correct spots. But Soph instantly fell behind during the first portion of the challenge and struggled to crawl through the mud.",
      "Meanwhile, Savannah sped through nearly every portion and quickly completed the puzzle, giving her a record-tying fourth Immunity Challenge win and guaranteeing her a spot in the final four.  She also won the reward and chose to take Sage to the Sanctuary to enjoy steak and potatoes.",
      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",

      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",

      "LONDON \u2014 Authorities in Britain and Australia are tightening restrictions on pro-Palestinians protests in response to the Islamic State-inspired Bondi Beach massacre targeting a Jewish gathering that killed 15 people.",
      "In New South Wales, the Australian state where the deadly attack on a Hanukkah celebration took place, police will be granted expanded powers to shut down unauthorized protests, while tougher hate speech laws will be introduced, including a proposed ban on the slogan \u201cglobalize the intifada.\u201d",
      "The move comes shortly after U.K. police arrested two people in London on racially aggravated public order charges for allegedly shouting slogans invoking \u201cintifada\u201d at a pro-Palestinian demonstration. The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",
      "Supporters say the term \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d which has been used for years at pro-Palestinian protests worldwide, refers to international solidarity against Israeli occupation.",

      "NSW Premier Chris Minns said Thursday that the \u201cimplications\u201d of pro-Palestinian rallies could be seen in the Bondi attack and, after authorities designated the shooting a terrorist event, he has introduced reforms that would give his government powers to shut down unauthorized protests for three months.",
      "\u201cWhen you see people marching and showing violent bloody images, images of death and destruction, it\u2019s unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain,\u201d he said.",
      "Minns on Saturday announced further reforms to hate speech laws that would ban the \"globalize the intifada\" chant alongside other \u201chateful comments and statements,\u201d as well as \u201cterrorist symbols such as the ISIS flags.\u201d",
      "In the United Kingdom, London Metropolitan Police and Greater Manchester Police said Wednesday officers would arrest people holding placards and chanting the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada,\u201d directly citing the context of the attack.

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Israeli officials have grown increasingly concerned that Iran is expanding production of its ballistic missile program, which was damaged by Israeli military strikes earlier this year, and are preparing to brief President Donald Trump about options for attacking it again, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plans and four former U.S. officials briefed on the plans.",
      "Israeli officials also are concerned that Iran is reconstituting nuclear enrichment sites the U.S. bombed in June, the sources said. But, they added, the officials view Iran\u2019s efforts to rebuild facilities where they produce the ballistic missiles and to repair its crippled air defense systems as more immediate concerns.",
      "Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are expected to meet later this month in Florida at the president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate. At that meeting, the sources said, Netanyahu is expected to make the case to Trump that Iran\u2019s expansion of its ballistic missile program poses a threat that could necessitate swift action.",
      "They said part of his argument is expected to be that Iran\u2019s actions present perils not only to Israel but also to the broader region, including U.S. interests. The Israeli leader is expected to present Trump with options for the U.S. to join or assist in any new military operations, the sources said.",
      "Asked Thursday about a Dec. 29 meeting with Netanyahu, Trump told reporters, \u201cWe haven\u2019t set it up formally, but he\u2019d like to see me.\u201d Israeli officials have announced a Dec. 29 meeting.",
      "The Israeli government declined to comment. The Iranian Mission at the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe International Atomic Energy Agency and Iranian government corroborated the United States government\u2019s assessment that Operation Midnight Hammer totally obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities,\u201d White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \u201cAs President Trump has said, if Iran pursued a nuclear weapon, that site would be attacked and would be wiped out before they even got close.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s plans to brief Trump on \u2014 and give him the option to join \u2014 possible additional military strikes in Iran come as the president is considering military strikes in Venezuela, which would open a new warfront for the U.S., and as he is touting his administration\u2019s bombing campaign against Iran\u2019s nuclear program and success negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "In an address to the nation on Wednesday, Trump said told Americans he\u2019s \u201cdestroyed the Iran nuclear threat and ended the war in Gaza, bringing for the first time in 3,000 years, peace to the Middle East.\u201d",
      "The Israeli concerns about Iran come as Tehran has expressed interest in resuming diplomatic talks with the U.S. aimed at curtailing its nuclear deal, which could potentially complicate Israel\u2019s approaching Trump about new strikes.",
      "The funding of Iranian proxies in the region also is top of mind for the Israelis, according to the person with direct knowledge of Israel\u2019s plans.",
      "\u201cThe nuclear weapons program is very concerning. There\u2019s an attempt to reconstitute. It\u2019s not that immediate,\u201d this person said.",
      "The strikes the U.S. conducted in June against Iran, known as Operation Midnight Hammer, included more than 100 aircraft, a submarine and seven B-2 bombers. Trump has said they \u201cobliterated\u201d Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment sites, though some early assessments indicated the damage may not have been as extensive as the president has said.",
      "Israeli forces at the same time struck several of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile sites.",
      "Israeli military strikes in April and October 2024 also damaged all of Iran\u2019s S-300 air defense systems, the most advanced system the country operates, clearing the way for manned flights into Iranian airspace months later by dramatically reducing the threat to pilots.",
      "Unlike strikes on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, direct U.S. military involvement was needed to significantly damage Iran\u2019s nuclear sites as that required American-made 30,000-pound bunker-busting bombs.",
      "Last week, Trump hinted he might be open to returning to talks with Iran, while also warning Tehran against trying to reconstitute its ballistic missile or nuclear programs.",
      "He said Iran \u201ccan try\u201d to rebuild its ballistic missile program, but \u201cit\u2019s going to take them a long time to come back.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut if they do want to come back without a deal, then we\u2019re going to obliterate that one, too,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, we can knock out their missiles very quickly, we have great power.\u201d",
      "Prior to the strikes in June, the Israelis had presented Trump with four options for military action, according to the person with direct knowledge of Israel\u2019s plans. Israeli officials laid out the options on a coffee table in the Oval Office, this person said. One involved Israel going it alone, another included limited U.S. support, a third was the U.S. and Israel conducting joint operations against Iran, and a fourth had the U.S. conducting the operation on its own, this person said. Ultimately Trump decided to approve a joint operation. The person with direct knowledge of Israel\u2019s plans suggested Netanyahu may present Trump with a similar set of options during their Mar-a-Lago meeting.",
      "The fragile ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas is also expected to feature prominently in the talks between Netanyahu and Trump, amid concerns both sides are failing to take action to carry out the next phase of the deal.",
      "Under the second stage of the agreement, Israel is supposed to withdraw its forces from Gaza, and an interim body is to assume authority over the Palestinian enclave instead of Hamas. An international stabilization force also is supposed to be deployed to Gaza.",
      "Trump could be less enthusiastic about new military action in Iran if there continues to be friction between U.S. and Israeli officials over Netanyahu\u2019s approach to the ceasefire, two former Israeli officials said.",
      "Left unchecked, Iran\u2019s production of ballistic missiles could increase to as many as 3,000 per year, according to the person with direct knowledge of Israel\u2019s plans and former U.S. officials briefed on the plans.",
      "The threat of ballistic missiles, and the number of them that the Iranians could use in an attack, is Israel\u2019s most immediate concern, said one of the former Israeli officials who has discussed the concerns with current Israeli officials.",
      "\u201cThere is no real question after the last conflict that we can gain aerial superiority and can do far more damage to Iran than Iran can do to Israel,\u201d the official said. \u201cBut the threat of the missiles is very real, and we weren\u2019t able to prevent them all last time.\u201d",
      "A large volume of ballistic missiles would help Iran better defend its nuclear enrichment sites, the person with direct knowledge of Israel\u2019s plans and one of the former U.S. officials briefed on the plans said. They said Israeli officials have the same concerns about Iran rebuilding its missile defense systems and funding and arming its proxies in the region, believing Tehran would then fast track reconstituting its nuclear program because it would better be able to defend its enrichment sites.",
      "CORRECTION (Dec. 20, 2025, 3:30 p.m. E.T.): A previous version of this article misstated the number of ballistic missiles Iran could produce. It is 3,000 per year, not per month."

The new restrictions are part of a nationwide policing shift in response to the attack, which has drawn concern from some civil liberties and free-speech advocates.",
      "The Arabic word \"intifada\" is generally translated as \"uprising\" and is used to describe two major Palestinian uprisings in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip against Israeli occupation, the first beginning in 1987 and the second in 2000, both characterized by periods of violence as well as nonviolent mass protests.",

    "story": [
      "A pair of deadly attacks this month, in Syria and Australia, has shone a fresh spotlight on the Islamic State, the militant group whose sudden rise to power in the Middle East and reign of terror throughout the world had appeared to crest, and then fall, during the 2010s.",
      "But for experts who study ISIS, law enforcement and intelligence officials who fight it and the growing number of victims who have been attacked or intimidated, the group has long been more down than out \u2013 a diminished threat, but a threat nonetheless.",
      "\u201cThey never went away,\u201d said Aaron Zelin, an expert on the group and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cThe nature of the threat just changed and the nature of the way they organized themselves changed. But what\u2019s animated the Islamic State has never changed.\u201d",
      "Last weekend, a member of Syria\u2019s security forces shot dead three Americans -- two soldiers and an interpreter -- near the city of Palmyra. The Islamic State didn\u2019t claim responsibility for the attack, but the U.S. and Syrian governments both blamed the terrorist group.",
      "The U.S. military launched strikes against Islamic State infrastructure and weapons sites in Syria in retaliation for the attack, officials said Friday.",
      "\u201cWe are striking very strongly against ISIS strongholds in Syria, a place soaked in blood which has many problems, but one that has a bright future if ISIS can be eradicated,\u201d President Donald Trump  said Friday in a post on Truth Social.",
      "In Sydney, two men opened fire on a Hanukkah gathering at  Bondi Beach on Sunday, killing at least 15 people. Both men were shot by police. One man died; the other, the man\u2019s son, survived and has been charged in the attack. Islamic State social media accounts traditionally linked to the group praised the attack but did not officially claim responsibility, referring to it  in an official publication as \"Sydney's pride.\" The two suspects were found with Islamic State flags and literature.",
      "While the two incidents were notable for their geographic spread, the identities of those killed and a perception that the Islamic State had faded from global headlines, experts say they were exceptions that belie a measurable metric: ISIS is getting weaker, and arrests and attacks have been declining globally.",
      "\u201cThere will always be some space for attacks here and there. But the trajectory is that ISIS is still on the decline,\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House, a London-based foreign policy think tank. \u201cAnyone who has a grievance and finds a network can basically attack, and in many cases the central ISIS leaders don\u2019t know it happens until it happens, and then they claim it.\u201d",
      "The group has claimed 1,100 attacks so far in 2025, he said, down from a high of 3,460 in 2019.",
      "There have been 383 ISIS-related arrests worldwide so far in 2025, Zelin said, citing the Washington Institute\u2019s Islamic State Select Worldwide Activity Map, an initiative he leads. Reporting from police sources found 531 such arrests last year, Zelin said, the vast majority of which occurred in active war zones such as Iraq and Syria.",
      "One thing the recent attacks showcase is a strategy that has made the Islamic State effective in the past: its big-tent approach to operations and ideology that allow \u201clone-wolf\u201d actors to affiliate themselves with ISIS with almost no vetting or coordination.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re seeing more of and more of the hallmarks of ISIS-related activity that date back 10 years ago,\u201d Rebecca Weiner, Deputy Commissioner Intelligence and Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, told NBC News. \u201cThe do-it-yourself model was professionalized and has been really deployed around the world by ISIS, inspiring dozens of people to carry out attacks in their name.\u201d",
      "The Islamic State emerged from the ferment of Syria\u2019s civil war in the early 2010s, when Syria\u2019s porous borders and surfeit of Islamist fighters offered fertile recruiting ground for all manner of jihadi groups. But ISIS  distinguished itself by forming a self-governing state encompassing parts of Syria and Iraq that promised a return to the political expansionism of early Islam.",
      "Though defeated, that \u201ccaliphate\u201d has remained a central part of the Islamic State\u2019s message, even as the group has shifted its focus more toward terrorism than nation-building.",
      "The two suspects in the Bondi Beach shooting are known to have visited the Philippines before the attack. If investigators find that the two men underwent ISIS commando training in southern Mindanao island, that could point to a level of centralized coordination that investigators haven\u2019t seen from ISIS in years.",
      "The group\u2019s activities over the past year have also shown an enduring, if dampened, public appeal.",
      "On Tuesday, Polish authorities said they had arrested a teenager who they said had sought contact with the group and whom they suspected of planning an attack on a Christmas market.",
      "In Michigan in October, two men were charged with plotting a mass shooting over Halloween weekend.",

      "The Islamic State has still been unable to reconstitute its so-called caliphate, a vast Islamist emirate the group ruled across parts of Iraq and Syria until it was finally destroyed in 2019. In both countries, Islamic State attacks reached historic lows in the past year.",

      "When Syrian President Ahmed Al Sharaa \u2014 himself a former Islamist militant who once led a like-minded Al Qaeda offshoot group \u2014 joined the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS last month, it painted a target on the Syrian government\u2019s back.",

      "Decades before this week\u2019s manhunt through New England ended with the discovery of his body in a storage facility, Claudio Manuel Neves Valente had been an academic powerhouse in his home country of Portugal. Enrolled at one of the country\u2019s most prestigious engineering schools, Neves Valente graduated at the top of his class, seemingly poised for a bright future.",
      "Now, Neves Valente is dead at age 48, suspected of committing two shocking acts of violence \u2014 and authorities in both the United States and Portugal are looking for a motive that could explain his actions.",
      "Officials believe Neves Valente was behind a mass shooting that killed two students and injured nine other people on Saturday at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. He is also suspected of fatally shooting 47-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Nuno Loureiro at Loureiro\u2019s home in the Boston suburb of Brookline on Monday.",
      "The shootings gripped residents of Rhode Island and Massachusetts as days passed without anyone in custody. Then on Thursday, authorities announced they had closed in on a storage unit in Salem, New Hampshire, where they found Neves Valente\u2019s body, who appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "Little is known about how he chose his targets, though Neves Valente has past connections to Brown and to Loureiro.",
      "A Providence police affidavit says that Neves Valente came to the U.S. to attend Brown University from August 2000 to spring 2001 on a student visa in the physics Ph.D. program. He requested a leave of absence from the school in 2001, and ultimately withdrew in 2003, the affidavit said.",
      "Neves Valente did not obtain a degree during his time there, Brown\u2019s president said in an email, and he did not have a current affiliation with the university. The email said that during his three semesters at Brown, Neves Valente most likely would have spent time in Barus & Holley, the building where Saturday\u2019s massacre occurred.",
      "Scott Watson told NBC News that he attended Brown with Neves Valente and had been his only friend there. He said Neves Valente was socially awkward and would often complain about Brown.",
      "\u201cHe would say the classes were too easy \u2014 honestly, for him they were,\u201d Watson wrote in an email. \u201cHe already knew most of the material and was genuinely impressive.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe could be kind and gentle, though he often became frustrated \u2014 sometimes angry \u2014 about courses, professors, and living conditions,\u201d Watson wrote.",
      "Watson recalled a conflict that Neves Valente had with another student whom he said Neves Valente would refer to as a \"slave\" because the student was from Brazil.",
      "\"I had to break up a fight once,\" he wrote.",
      "Prior to that time, both Neves Valente and Loureiro, the MIT professor, attended the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, according to the school, which said that they were enrolled from 1995 to 2000 in the undergraduate program in technological physics engineering. Rog\u00e9rio Cola\u00e7o, the president of Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, told the Portuguese newspaper Expresso that Neves Valente graduated with a final average grade of 19 out of 20 \u2014 an exceptionally high score, particularly given how rigorous the university is.",
      "Even before starting college, Neves Valente had made a strong impression academically. He represented Portugal at the 1995 International Physics Olympiad for secondary school students, in Canberra, Australia, a news clip from the science publication Gazeta da F\u00edsica shows.",
      "Yet Neves Valente seemed to have left little imprint on those he studied with.",
      "\u201cMost classmates have no memory of Cl\u00e1udio Valente, other than the fact that he was the top student in the program that year,\u201d Cola\u00e7o told Expresso.",
      "Loureiro, meanwhile, was a researcher at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico's plasmas and nuclear fusion unit and was described in a statement from the school as a \"brilliant colleague.\"",
      "\"His friends and colleagues at IPFN and at T\u00e9cnico, some of whom continued to collaborate with Nuno to this day, are deeply distressed by his premature passing,\" the statement said. \"We remember a brilliant colleague, with whom it was a scientific and personal pleasure to collaborate.\"",
      "Alex Schekochihin, a longtime friend and colleague of Loureiro's, said in an email that it was difficult to find anyone who did not like Loureiro.",
      "\"He was a fantastic physicist, a very effective leader with a clear vision and sophisticated sense of strategy, and an amazing human being,\" he wrote.",
      "What Neves Valente accomplished personally or professionally after graduation is not as clear.",
      "Loureiro was a widely known figure \"to anyone who follows the field,\u201d said Carlos Fiolhais, a professor emeritus of physics at the University of Coimbra. \"Valente was a physicist by training, not a researcher, with no known published articles. ... This is aberrant. It is deeply disturbing for the scientific community.\u201d",
      "The Providence police affidavit said that Neves Valente obtained legal permanent resident status in 2017. Public records show he lived in Las Vegas that year and, more recently, appeared to reside in Miami. He had rented a hotel room in Boston twice in late November, an FBI agent wrote in a separate affidavit.",
      "A tipster on the chat forum Reddit led authorities to track down Neves Valente after the shootings. The Portuguese Criminal Police, Portugal\u2019s investigative force, said it was cooperating with U.S. authorities in the investigation.",
      "The Brown University students killed in Saturday\u2019s attack were identified as Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov and Ella Cook. Umurzokov, from Uzbekistan, was remembered by his aunt as kind and smart; Cook, from Birmingham, Alabama, had been the vice president of Brown\u2019s college Republicans group and was described by her church as an \u201cincredible, grounded, faithful, bright light.\u201d",
      "Loureiro had been a world-renowned plasma physicist and fusion scientist who joined MIT in 2016. In a video posted to YouTube earlier this year, Loureiro spoke about his work and offered advice to students in his field.",
      "\u201cI think on any given day, it\u2019s tempting to go for the low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \u201cBe a little more ambitious and tackle the really hard problems.\u201d"

      "The attack \u2014 Australia\u2019s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades \u2014 killed 15 people during a seaside Hanukkah celebration and was designated a terrorist attack targeting the Jewish community. One suspected shooter was killed during the attack, while the other was injured and charged with terrorism and murder after he awoke from a coma, as Australian investigators probe their alleged connection to the Islamic State terror group.",
      "A minute of silence was observed at 6:47 p.m. local time (2:47 a.m. E.T.) on Sunday, exactly seven days since the attack began. A candle projection lit up Sydney Opera House, while crowds of mourners attended an evening memorial at Bondi, guarded by a heavy police presence, including snipers on rooftops and police boats in the waters.",
      "David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, told the crowd: \"Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place.\"",
      "But he pointed to the heroism of Ahmed al-Ahmed, a Syrian-Australian fruit shop owner who disarmed one of the shooters, adding that \"a single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward.\"",
      "Ossip read a message to the crowd from al-Ahmed, who is recovering in the hospital after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds. In his message, al-Ahmed said: \"The Lord is close to the broken-hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters.\"",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was in attendance at the memorial, as well as Governor-General Sam Mostyn, King Charles' representative in Australia. Former prime minister of Australia John Howard was photographed embracing mourners in the crowd.",
      "The shooting has left Australians across the country reeling, with tributes accompanied by a reckoning over the government\u2019s response to growing antisemitism and the availability of guns in the country.",
      "Albanese was booed by the crowds as he arrived for the memorial on Sunday night. It comes after criticism from leaders in Australia\u2019s Jewish community and some of the victims\u2019 families, who have blamed the Australian government for missing the signs of growing antisemitism in the wake of the war between Hamas and Israel that erupted in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023 attack, and accused it of not doing enough to protect the country\u2019s Jewish community.",
      "On Sunday, Albanese commissioned a review into Australia\u2019s federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to examine whether they have the \u201cright powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe\u201d in the wake of the attack.",
      "\u201cThe ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation,\u201d his statement said. \u201cOur security agencies must be in the best position to respond.\u201d The review is to be completed by next April, Albanese said.",
      "State authorities in New South Wales have moved to tighten restrictions on pro-Palestinian protests and hate speech in the aftermath of the attack, with NSW Premier Chris Minns saying that protests were \"unleashing something in our community that the organizers of the protest can\u2019t contain.\"",
      "Suspected gunman Naveed Akram, 24, was charged with 59 offenses Wednesday, including terrorism and 15 counts of murder, after he awoke from a coma in a Sydney hospital, having been shot by police. He is alleged to have carried out the attack alongside his father, Sajid Akram, 50.",
      "Two \u201chomemade\u201d Islamic State flags were found in the younger suspect\u2019s car, police said last week, adding that the pair travelled to the Philippines last month \u2014 seen in the past as a hot spot for Islamic extremists.",
      "In its weekly \u2018Al-Naba\u2019 magazine bulletin, Islamic State praised the attack, describing it as a \u2018source of pride,\u2019 though it did not directly claim responsibility for the attack.",
      "Naveed Akram came to the attention of Australia\u2019s domestic intelligence agency in 2019, Albanese said last week, and he was probed for six months over his alleged extremist associations, but it was determined that he posed no threat.",
      "Albanese has also called to toughen up the country\u2019s already strict gun laws immediately after the attack and on Friday said Australia would launch a national gun buyback scheme."

They can use \u2014 you know, there are many ways of doing it, but we\u2019re going to let them buy their own health care. They\u2019ll get much better health care at a much lower price.\"",

      "For the second year in a row, North Korea\u2019s vast cryptocurrency hacking operation has broken its own record, stealing $2.02 billion in 2025, new research says.",
      "A report published Thursday by the blockchain watchdog company Chainalysis found that North Korea broke its own record of $1.3 billion in hacked and stolen crypto like bitcoin and ethereum. That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",
      "A significant chunk of that comes from the hack of the Dubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit this year. The hackers \u2014 who worked for North Korea\u2019s elite government hacking squad, according to the U.S. Secret Service \u2014 stole around $1.5 billion, mostly in ethereum, in February, Bybit\u2019s CEO said.",

      "The United Nations and private researchers have long accused North Korea, which is beset by international sanctions and has relations with only a handful of countries, of deploying its hackers to steal cryptocurrency to help fund its nuclear weapons and missile programs.",

      "Part of the theft is most likely due to the increasingly common phenomenon of North Korean hackers\u2019 fraudulently obtaining remote technical jobs with international companies, the report said. That access can put them in positions to give their hacker colleagues a foothold to steal cryptocurrency keys and wire crypto to Pyongyang.",
      "There are scattered incidents of other countries\u2019 professional hackers\u2019 stealing large amounts of money. The Secret Service previously linked Chinese government hackers to an operation that stole U.S. Covid relief benefits, and the U.S. and U.K. governments have accused some financially motivated Russian cybercriminals of ties to the Kremlin.",
      "But no country has an alleged operation like North Korea\u2019s, whose hackers working directly for the government routinely steal such large sums from companies around the world.",
      "Leaked documents have previously shown that North Korea has deployed some of the most sophisticated international money laundering operations on the planet.",
      "Crypto is also generally much easier to launder at a large scale than traditional currency. Exchanges often hold it in vast sums, making them extremely ripe targets for North Korea.",
      "Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets, or accounts that can be accessed with private keys, and it remains the case that if hackers gain control of an account, they can quickly wire it to a different wallet that they own. Unlike with traditional finance, there are few ways to reverse a fraudulent transaction.",
      "\u201cDespite their institutional resources and professional security teams, these platforms remain vulnerable because of this fundamental security challenge,\u201d the Chainalysis report found.",
