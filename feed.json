    "story": [
      "Merriam-Webster\u2019s 2025 word of the year is \u201cslop.\u201d",
      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt's self-referential,\" Barlow said. \u201cIt\u2019s all the rage, but it\u2019s not a defining term.\u201d",
      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "A conclave is the centuries-old election of a pope that derives its name from the Italian \u201ccon clave\u201d \u2014 meaning \u201cwith a key\u201d \u2014 to underscore that cardinals are sequestered until they find a winner.",

      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said. In the Roblox game Spelling Bee!, the Massachusetts lake\u2019s name can be encountered in special modes. But in New England? It's known as Webster Lake.",

      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material.

      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- When actor Amy Baik was cast in a South Korean commercial last year, she thought she had landed a promising gig.",
      "But after filming wrapped, she was shocked to learn that both the director and advertiser had cut her scenes \u2014 not because of her performance, but because she lacked a facial feature prized in South Korean beauty standards.",
      "\u201cThe reason was that I don\u2019t have double eyelids,\u201d said Baik, 26.",
      "\u201cAfter receiving that feedback, I started to reconsider what kind of appearance Korea wants,\" she said, adding it \"made me wonder how I can survive as an actor in South Korea.\u201d",

The global success of \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cMinari\u201d and \u201cSquid Game\u201d has opened doors for South Korean performers in Hollywood \u2014 and spawned a cottage industry of consultants helping actors navigate American casting.",
      "\u201cHollywood\u2019s the dream (...) the ultimate pinnacle of acting accolades,\u201d said Julia Kim, a Korean American casting director who worked on \u201cMinari,\u201d Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cButterfly\u201d and \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "While established stars like Park Hae-soo and Lee Byung-hun have both South Korean and American representation, most aspiring Korean actors lack such connections. That gap is what talent agencies like Los Angeles-based Upstage Entertainment are trying to bridge.",

She attributes that shift partly to the global popularity of South Korean entertainment.",
      "Still, stereotypes persist. \u201cThe one that irritates me is the nerdy tech programmer,\" Dumbell said. \u201cSometimes I just won\u2019t even submit my actor for that because I know that they\u2019re much more nuanced as actors.\u201d",
      "For most South Korean actors without connections or know-how, Hollywood is still uncharted territory.",
      "Kim, who typically casts high-profile stars and works with local casting directors for co-productions, also finds actors via social media. \u201cI usually put out an open call on my Instagram,\u201d she said.",
      "But for actors without major agency backing, the right contacts are hard to find. The American and Korean industries operate differently, and U.S. casting information rarely reaches those outside established networks.",
      "Kim said South Korean talent faces a steep learning curve. \u201cI would get questions \u2014 should I change my Korean name to a Western name? Do I pay to get an agent? Can I look into the camera when I\u2019m doing an audition?\u201d she said. Even name consistency is an issue: Kim recalled a K-pop artist turned actor whose name appeared five different ways online.",

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself as one of the preeminent filmmakers of his generation with movies such as \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d and \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d has died. He was 78.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation confirmed their identities but could not publicly discuss details of the investigation and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "Authorities were investigating an \u201capparent homicide,\u201d said Capt. Mike Bland with the Los Angeles Police Department. The Los Angeles Fire Department said it responded to a medical aid request shortly after 3:30 p.m.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways follow in his father's footsteps, working both in front and behind the camera, in comedies that stretched from broad sketch work to accomplished dramedies.",
      "\u201cMy father thought, \u2018Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,\u2019\u201d Reiner told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in October, recalling the temptation to change his name. \u201cAnd he says, \u2018What do you want to change your name to?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Carl.\u2019 I just wanted to be like him.\u201d",
      "After starting out as a writer for \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\u201d Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast in Norman Lear's \u201cAll in the Family\u201d as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic. But by the 1980s, Reiner began as a feature film director, churning out some of the most beloved films of that, or any, era. His first film, the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \u201cThis Is Spinal Tap,\u201d remains the quintessential mockumentary.",
      "After the 1985 John Cusack summer comedy, \u201cThe Sure Thing,\u201d Reiner made \u201cStand By Me\u201d (1986), \u201cThe Princess Bride\u201d (1987) and \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally \u2026\u201d (1989), a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics, all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption.\u201d By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it, and this fall released the long-in-coming sequel \u201cSpinal Tap II: The End Continues.\u201d",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. And Reiner was an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re a nepo baby, doors will open,\u201d Reiner told the Guardian in 2024. \u201cBut you have to deliver. If you don\u2019t deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\u201d",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he quickly set out to follow his father into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",

      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",
      "But box-office expectations weren\u2019t high coming in from \u201cElla McCay,\u201d a comic drama about a 34-year-old woman (newcomer Emma Mackey) who becomes governor of her home state. Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",
      "With overall ticket sales on the year running close to even with last year's disappointing grosses, according to Comscore data, Hollywood will be hoping the coming holiday corridor, traditionally the busiest moviegoing period of the year, ends 2025 on a high note. Movies on tap include \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d \u201cAnaconda\u201d and \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "Fellow writers could only envy Kinsella's success, how early it came and how seemingly easy. As the author would remember, she was a 24-year-old financial journalist who, while commuting by train one day, thought to herself, \u201cI want to have a go at this, I want to write a book.\u201d Within two years, she was the bestselling author of \u201cThe Tennis Party,\u201d under her real name, Madeleine Wickham.",

      "\u201cThey all have a lot of baggage,\u201d the author explained on her website. \u201cThey sleep with each other, they behave very badly, drink a lot of Pimms, thrash tennis balls around, and things come to a head quite intensely.\u201d",
      "She published her first several books as Wickham, before becoming a global brand as \u201cSophie Kinsella.\u201d Spurred by this first \u201cShopaholic\u201d novel, millions would cheer on the hopelessly indebted financial journalist Becky Bloomwood, who helps keep the economy turning with her \u201cinvestments\u201d in clothing, household and other products.",
      "Among the most cherished fantasies in her dreamworld: that some \u201cdotty old woman in Cornwall\u201d will mistakenly receive her \u201chumongous\u201d credit card bill and pay if off without checking the name. Becky, meanwhile, will be sent the woman's bill for three tins of cat food, \u201cwhich, naturally, I'll pay without question.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",

      "Federal health officials have expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to ByHeart baby formula to include any illnesses reported since the company began production in 2022",
      "Federal health officials on Wednesday expanded an outbreak of infant botulism tied to recalled ByHeart baby formula to include all illnesses reported since the company began production in March 2022.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said investigators \u201ccannot rule out the possibility that contamination might have affected all ByHeart formula products\u201d ever made.",
      "The outbreak now includes at least 51 infants in 19 states. The new case definition includes \u201cany infant with botulism who was exposed to ByHeart formula at any time since the product's release,\u201d according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The most recent illness was reported on Dec. 1.",
      "No deaths have been reported in the outbreak, which was announced Nov. 8.",
      "Previously, health officials had said the outbreak included 39 suspected or confirmed cases of infant botulism reported in 18 states since August. That's when officials at California's Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program reported a rise in treatment of infants who had consumed ByHeart formula. With the expanded definition, the CDC identified 10 additional cases that occurred from December 2023 through July 2025.",
      "ByHeart, a New York-based manufacturer of organic infant formula founded in 2016, recalled all its products sold in the U.S. on Nov. 11. The company, which accounts for about 1% of the U.S. infant formula market, had been selling about 200,000 cans of the product each month.",
      "News that ByHeart products could have been contaminated for years was distressing to Andi Galindo, whose 5-week-old daughter, Rowan, was hospitalized in December 2023 with infant botulism after drinking the formula. Galindo, 36, of Redondo Beach, California, said she insisted on using ByHeart formula to supplement a low supply of breast milk because it was recommended by a lactation consultant as \u201cvery natural, very gentle, very good for the babies.\"",
      "\u201cThat's a hard one,\u201d Galindo said. \u201cIf there is proof that there were issues with their manufacturing and their plant all the way back from the beginning, that is a problem and they really need to be held accountable.\"",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking ByHeart. Being included in the investigation of the outbreak \u201cfeels like a win for all of us,\u201d she said Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve known in my gut from the beginning that ByHeart was the reason Hank got sick, and to see that these cases are now part of the investigation brings me to tears \u2014 a mix of relief, gratitude and hope that the truth is finally being recognized,\u201d she said.",
      "ByHeart officials did not immediately respond to questions about the expanded outbreak.",
      "The FDA sent inspectors last month to ByHeart plants in Allerton, Iowa, and Portland, Oregon, where the formula is produced and packaged. The agency has released no results from those inspections.",
      "The company previously reported that tests by an independent laboratory showed that 36 samples from three different lots contained the type of bacteria that can cause infant botulism.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rule out the risk that all ByHeart formula across all product lots may have been contaminated,\u201d the company wrote on its website last month.",
      "Those results and discussions with the FDA led CDC officials to expand the outbreak, according to Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the investigation.",
      "\u201cIt looks like the contamination appeared to persist across all production runs, different lots, different raw material lots,\u201d Cope said. \u201cThey couldn't isolate it to specific lots from a certain time period.\u201d",

      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid rate cuts he initiated two months ago",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein is canceling Medicaid reimbursement rate reductions he initiated two months ago, a decision that protects short-term access to care for vulnerable patients while a political fight with Republican legislators to enact additional funding is resolved.",
      "Stein and state Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Dev Sangvai announced Wednesday the state agency would restore reimbursement rates for doctors, hospitals and other medical providers of Medicaid services that otherwise generally had been cut by 3% to 10% starting Oct. 1.",
      "The governor had said the reductions were needed to deal with a funding shortfall for Medicaid, which serves more than 3 million people in the ninth-largest state. But legal challenges to the reductions that have resulted recently in judicial rulings demanding some rates return to pre-October levels make maintaining the reductions untenable.",
      "\u201cWhat has not changed is the program doesn\u2019t have enough money. What has changed is that the courts have made very clear that the rates have to go back,\u201d Stein told The Associated Press in an interview.",
      "The first-year governor had said the reductions, while painful for Medicaid patients and providers, were unavoidable because a stopgap spending measure the legislature approved in the summer fell $319 million short of what was needed to address population changes and rising health care costs.",
      "\u201cThe legislature forced these cuts onto the program,\u201d Stein said. \u201cIt was absolutely nothing that the department or I wanted to have happen.\u201d",
      "Republican legislators said Stein's actions were unnecessary, unprecedented early in the fiscal year and politically motivated. Still, state House and Senate GOP leaders tried but could not work out this fall legislation to provide extra money that would sustain the program longer.",
      "Stein attempted in recent weeks to pressure lawmakers to act \u2014 even by formally calling a special legislative session last month. But House Speaker Destin Hall and Senate leader Phil Berger refused to convene, saying Stein had failed to meet the qualifications for such an extraordinary session.",
      "The governor was pushed to relent as Medicaid consumers such as children with autism and providers like adult care homes have successfully sued the health department so far and blocked certain rate reductions.",
      "The plaintiffs accused the state of violating laws by reducing rates unilaterally and discriminating against those with disabilities. A host of groups representing thousands of doctors and other service providers filed their own challenges last week to block the rates more broadly.",
      "As part of the reversal, Sangvai said, the providers will receive retroactively reimbursements for the difference between the reduced and full rates for claims that were filed after the reductions took effect.",

      "European Union leaders are gathering this week at the end of political year dominated by U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "BRUSSELS -- Over the course of 2025, a new reality has sunk in for Europe. The United States, long its strongest ally, has chipped away at the European Union's unity, economies, security and even its democracies, setting the backdrop for an EU summit this week at the end of an exceptionally trying year.",
      "After putting an indefinite freeze last week on Russian assets in Europe, EU leaders face a new test of strength at Thursday's summit. Ukraine is in dire financial straits, and they have promised to meet Kyiv's economic and military needs for the next two years, most probably through a new reparations loan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crunch time for Europe and Ukraine,\u201d warned Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency. \"We need to take this decision in order to secure the Ukrainian economy, but also in order to send a signal to the rest of the world, which will include the White House in (Washington) D.C., that Europe is a strong geopolitical player.\u201d",
      "As the continent\u2019s biggest land war in decades rages on, the Europeans have been tested by President Donald Trump\u2019s threats, his support for Europe\u2019s far right, and his camaraderie with Russian President Vladimir Putin. At first they responded with flattery. Less so in recent months.",
      "Since January, as the leaders have tried to keep Ukraine in the fight against its bigger neighbor, Trump has switched back and forth, appearing to support Kyiv one month, Russia the next. He has mostly remained critical of Europe, and that criticism now has a sharper edge.",
      "European leaders have worked to fill the gap and shore up military support for Ukraine, but they concede that the United States is an irreplaceable partner, and Trump is the only person Putin might talk peace with.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz warned last week that \u201cwe are really witnessing a watershed moment now and nothing is the way it was before. We\u2019re living in a different time, and this time requires different responses than we\u2019ve given in the past.\u201d",
      "Weeks after Trump returned to office in January, his administration signaled that U.S. security interests lie elsewhere: Europe must now look after itself and Ukraine, whose president was humiliated at a White House meeting in February.",
      "Days later, Vice President JD Vance met with a far-right leader in Germany, claiming that free speech is in retreat in Europe, sparking allegations of election interference.",
      "Vance\u2019s themes were developed this month in a U.S. National Security Strategy. The text also attacked EU migration policy, suggesting that Europe faces \u201cthe prospect of civilizational erasure\u201d and might not be reliable as an American partner.",

Trump, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, is \u201cthe only Western leader\u201d who shows \u201can understanding of the reasons that made war in Ukraine inevitable.\u201d",

He said that \u201cour country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other nations, including U.S. allies in the world's biggest security organization, NATO.",
      "Trump declared an economic emergency. By July, he and the EU had agreed a trade framework setting a 15% tariff on most goods, staving off far higher import duties.",
      "The response of the EU has been to seek deals with other jilted partners, notably throughout Asia. The world's biggest trading bloc has also accepted that higher tariffs were probably the best price to pay for continued U.S. support in Ukraine.",

      "Still, the EU has since taken its foot off the defense spending brakes and aims to be capable of defending against outside attack by 2030. Officials believe Putin could order an attack elsewhere in Europe in three to five years should Russia defeat Ukraine.",

      "The earthquake caused more than 40 mostly mild injuries and damaged dozens of homes, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.

      "Now, he could face life in prison after being convicted of conspiracies to commit sedition and collusion with foreign forces in a landmark trial that began in 2023.",
      "Lai, 78, is an outspoken critic of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party who was arrested in 2020 under a national security law following massive anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong the year before.",
      "His arrest and the closure of his Apple Daily newspaper, a tabloid-style publication that backed the democracy movement, dealt a blow to free speech in a city that was once a bastion of press freedom in Asia.",
      "Born in mainland China, Lai was just 12 when he arrived in Hong Kong on a fishing boat as a stowaway, hoping for a better life in the then-British colony. He began working as a child laborer in a glove factory, where he was introduced to the garment industry. He later founded the popular casual wear chain Giordano in 1981.",
      "But a pivotal moment for Lai was the Beijing deadly crackdown on the 1989 student-led pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square: His company printed T-shirts in support of the protests and he became interested in media to disseminate information.",
      "He founded Next Magazine in 1990, and five years later, Apple Daily. The news outlet attracted a strong following with its sometimes sensational reports, investigative scoops and short animated video reports. Being openly critical of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments, the newspaper was well-received among pro-democracy readers.",
      "In 1994, he insulted then-Chinese Premier Li Peng, calling him \u201cthe son of a turtle egg,\u201d an offensive slur in Chinese culture, after Li justified the Tiananmen crackdown. China pressured the Giordano brand and Lai had to sell his stake in the company.",
      "His long-time friend Lee Wing-tat, also an activist, said Lai was a firm believer in democracy, freedom and the \u201csmall government, big market\u201d economic principle, which emphasizes minimal state intervention and free trade. This was shaped by his childhood experience in mainland China, where his family suffered under the Communist Party's rule, and his rags-to-riches journey in the city, Lee said.",
      "Lai organized informal gatherings for pro-democracy lawmakers and scholars to discuss policies over meals in the 1990s, in the hopes of influencing politicians, Lee said.",
      "He also took to the streets, including massive pro-democracy protests in 2014, known as the Umbrella Movement, and made donations to pro-democracy parties, including one that Lee used to chair. His newspaper often urged readers to join protests.",
      "Lai was among the demonstrators in the leaderless anti-government protests in 2019. He met with then-U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the time to discuss the developments linked to a now-withdrawn bill that sparked the unrest, angering Beijing.",
      "In 2020, China's national security law for Hong Kong, meant to quell the protests, loomed. In response, Apple Daily launched a campaign encouraging readers to petition U.S. President Donald Trump, during his first term, to \u201csave Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "During his trial, Lai\u2019s Apple Daily executives said he had influenced the newspaper\u2019s coverage, with one saying objections to the petition campaign were brushed aside. Prosecutors accused him of asking staff not to target Trump, and Lai later testified he hoped the American president could help stop the national security law.",

      "Investigators have concluded that South Korea\u2019s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate rivals and monopolize power",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s ousted conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power, investigators concluded Monday.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree in December 2024 lasted only several hours and resulted in his rapid downfall.",
      "Independent counsel Cho Eun-suk, who announced the six-month probe\u2019s result, also accused the former president and his military allies of ordering operations against North Korea, in a deliberate bid to stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law.",
      "Despite the lack of a serious response from North Korea, Cho said that Yoon declared martial law by branding the liberal-controlled legislature as \u201canti-state forces\u201d that must be urgently removed.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from Yoon, who is in jail while standing trials for high-stakes rebellion charges. Yoon has steadfastly maintained that his martial law declaration was a desperate attempt to draw public support for his fight against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which obstructed his agenda while holding a majority in the legislature.",
      "Meanwhile, police raided the headquarters of the Unification Church on Monday as they probe separate bribery allegations against more politicians. An independent investigation involving Yoon\u2019s wife and the church has been underway for several months.",
      "Cho said Yoon and his military associates had schemed to enforce martial law since before October 2023 and that they reshuffled top military officials to place their associates in key posts while removing a defense minister who opposed their plan. Cho said they hosted dinner parties to give their martial law plan traction among military leaders.",
      "Cho said Yoon, his Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun and Yeo In-hyung, then commander of the military\u2019s counterintelligence agency, orchestrated various military operations against North Korea from October 2024. Cho\u2019s deputy earlier accused Yoon of ordering drone flights over the North, which Yoon has argued he hadn\u2019t been informed of.",
      "The lead investigator said North Korea didn\u2019t retaliate, likely because it was preoccupied with its support of Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine, and so Yoon lacked legal grounds to impose military rule, but went ahead anyway to swiftly \u201ceradicate anti-state forces.\u201d",
      "\u201cYoon Suk Yeol ... tried to declare martial law by inciting military provocations by North Korea, but that plan failed,\u201d Cho said. \u201cYoon declared emergency martial law to monopolize and maintain power by taking control of the legislative and judiciary branches and eliminating his political opponents.\u201d",
      "In a case that showed the seriousness of Yoon\u2019s hostilities against his opponents, Cho said Yoon called his governing People Power Party\u2019s main rival Han Dong-hun \u201ca commie\u201d and said \u201cI\u2019ll shoot him to death\u201d in meetings with military generals.",

      "Hundreds of troops encircled the parliament building and entered the election commission offices after Yoon declared martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. Thousands of people flocked to the National Assembly at the time, protesting the decree and demanding Yoon step down. Lawmakers made it inside the building and voted down Yoon\u2019s order within hours. Lawmakers later in December voted to impeach Yoon, suspending his powers and putting his fate with the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April.",
      "Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae Myung became South Korea\u2019s new president via a snap election in June, and he appointed three independent counsels to probe Yoon\u2019s martial law and other allegations against him, his wife and other associates.",
      "Cho said that Yoon and 23 other people, including his top officials, including Defense Minister Kim, Prime Minister Han Duck-soo and Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, have been indicted over Yoon\u2019s martial law decree. Some military generals were also arrested and indicted by military prosecutors.",
      "Park said there were signs that Yoon and his allies feared potential interference from Washington and may have timed their martial law attempt after the U.S. presidential election in November to exploit the distraction created by the transition to a new president.",
      "Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee, was separately arrested and indicted over charges unrelated to her husband's martial law, including one that she received bribes through an intermediary from a Unification Church official seeking business favors.",
      "Police said they raided several Unification Church -related facilities, including its headquarters in Seoul and its sprawling complex in nearby Gapyeong, following allegations that the religious group offered money and gifts to a wider range of politicians than previously thought, including Democratic Party members. Officers also searched a detention center where the church's 82-year-old leader, Hak Ja Han, has been held since September.",

      "Afghanistan was invited but decided not to attend. Its Taliban-led government was tight-lipped on the reasons, with the foreign ministry saying only that it would not participate because Afghanistan \u201ccurrently maintains active engagement with regional countries through existing regional organizations and formats, and has made good progress in this regard.\u201d",
      "The statement from the talks in Iran stressed the importance of maintaining economic and trade ties with Afghanistan to improve living conditions and called for the country\u2019s integration into regional political and economic processes.",
      "The Taliban were isolated after they retook power in Afghanistan in August 2021, but in the past year, they have developed diplomatic ties. They now raise several billion dollars every year in tax revenues to keep the lights on.",
      "However, Afghanistan is still struggling economically. Millions rely on aid for survival, and the struggling economy has been further impacted by the international community not recognizing the Taliban government's seizure of power in the wake of the chaotic withdrawal of US-led troops in 2021. Natural disasters and the flow of Afghans fleeing Pakistan under pressure to return home have underlined Afghanistan\u2019s reliance on foreign aid to meet essential needs.",
      "The countries at the talks also voiced security concerns and pledged cooperation in combating terrorism, drug trafficking and human smuggling, while opposing any foreign military presence in Afghanistan. They underscored the responsibility of the international community to lift sanctions and release Afghanistan\u2019s frozen assets, and urged international organizations to support the dignified return of Afghan refugees from neighboring countries.",
      "The participants backed efforts to reduce tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, which have been particularly strained, with border clashes between the two sides killing dozens of civilians, soldiers and suspected militants and wounding hundreds more.",
      "The violence followed explosions in Kabul on Oct. 9 that Afghan authorities blamed on Pakistan. A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held since October, although there have been limited border clashes. The two sides failed to reach an overall agreement in November despite three rounds of peace talks.",

      "The president-elect, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, has expressed nostalgia for the 17-year military dictatorship of the late Gen. Augusto Pinochet, opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage and advocated in recent years for a constitutional ban on abortion.",
      "Those stances, which some say sabotaged Kast's previous presidential bids in the increasingly liberal country, didn't seem to matter in Sunday's election.",
      "Instead, Kast, 59, won a landslide victory by tapping into a deep well of resentment at the status quo in a country whiplashed by an unprecedented rise in organized crime and disappointed by the great expectations that President Gabriel Boric raised but will leave unfulfilled.",
      "Experts say this reflects the pervasive anti-incumbent mood that has gripped South America and, significantly, boosted the radical right at time when Trump is seeking to influence the region's political future.",
      "It's a dramatic turn from only two decades ago, when the commodities boom brought to power the so-called \u201cpink tide\u201d of left-wing leaders, like the late socialist icon Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who whipped up voters by railing against U.S. imperialism and vowing to redistribute their nations' wealth.",

      "But in stark contrast to his ideological allies, Kast promoted himself as a moderate in this election runoff against Jara, whose lifelong membership in Chile\u2019s hard-line Communist Party led many voters to view her as a radical despite her vows of fiscal restraint.",
      "\u201cHe's not who I wanted, but at the end of the day, he's the least bad option,\u201d said Carol Mesa, 54, who previously backed the right-wing establishment candidate, Evelyn Matthei, eliminated in the first round of voting last month. \u201cI couldn't vote for a communist. We need change.\u201d",
      "Despite his budget-slashing ambitions, Kast promised not to touch social benefits. He defended the free-market institutions that have guided Chile\u2019s economy over 35 years of democracy. And the devout Catholic and father of nine managed to avoid all talk of moral conservatism.",
      "\u201cThe main issues are crime and immigration, and that's why the majority of the middle class geared up to vote against continuity and in favor of Kast,\u201d said Kenneth Bunker, a Chilean political analyst. \u201cThey saw him as somebody that can deliver results that are much needed.\u201d",
      "In his first act as president-elect, Kast tried to narrow Chile\u2019s divisions and calm the fears of his critics, promising to \u201cbe the president of all Chileans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey say we are not good at agreements,\" he said. \u201cWe are going to surprise them.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- CAIRO (AP) \u2014 Sudan topped a watchlist of global humanitarian crises released Tuesday by an international aid group for the third year in a row as a devastating war grips the northeastern African country.",
      "The International Rescue Committee said Sudan was at the top of its annual Emergency Watchlist, which included 20 countries at risk of worsening humanitarian crises in 2026.",
      "The IRC called for scaling up global humanitarian funding, which has shrunk by 50% in the outgoing year and is on track to become the deadliest year for humanitarians.",
      "The list had the occupied Palestinian territories and South Sudan ranked second and third, respectively, due to debilitating humanitarian conditions. It also included Ethiopia, Haiti, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Lebanon and Ukraine. Syria and Yemen, both riddled with civil wars for over a decade, were also listed.",
      "Though the 20-country list represents just 12% of the world\u2019s population, it accounts for 89% of those in need, with 117 million displaced people, the IRC said. The group expects the listed countries to host more than half of the world\u2019s extremely poor by 2029, calling the crises a \u201cNew World Disorder\" replacing \u201cthe post-WWII international system once grounded in rules and rights.\u201d",
      "The IRC said many of the conflicts are driven by struggles for power and profit. In Sudan, the group says, the warning parties and their international backers are benefiting from the gold trade, which has devastating impacts on civilians.",
      "\u201cThis year\u2019s Watchlist is a testament to misery but also a warning,\u201d Miliband said. \u201cThe New World Disorder is here, and winds are picking up everywhere. Disorder begets disorder.\u201d",
      "The group called for a set of binding actions in response to global crises, including the suspension of U.N. Security Council veto power in cases of mass atrocities.",
      "Sudan plunged into chaos in April 2023 when a power struggle between the military and the powerful paramilitary Rapid Support Forces exploded into open fighting, with widespread mass killings and rapes, and ethnically motivated violence. This has amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the U.N. and international rights groups.",
      "The devastating war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to United Nations figures, but aid groups say that is an undercount and the true number could be many times higher. The conflict created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis, with over 14 million people displaced, disease outbreaks and famine spreading in parts of the country.",
      "\u201cThe scale of the crisis in Sudan \u2026 is a signature of this disorder,\u201d said David Miliband, President and CEO of the IRC. He called on the international community to take urgent action to stop 2026 from becoming \u201cthe most dangerous year yet.\u201d",

      "Anutin, who has been in office for only three months and is seeking another term, disbanded the legislature after the main opposition party prepared to call for a no-confidence vote over an issue of constitutional change.",

Another major contender would be the populist Pheu Thai Party, backed by billionaire former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "The dissolution comes as Thailand is engaged in large-scale combat with Cambodia over a long-standing border dispute. Anutin has adopted an aggressive military stance to appeal to nationalistic public sentiment, experts say.",
      "His party saw a slip in popularity prior to the conflict due to the southern flood crisis that killed more than 160 people, and his government\u2019s mishandling of major scam scandals, which tainted some officials and figures in the Thai business community.",
      "\u201cAnutin played the nationalist card from the start of his premiership and also actively courted the military.

For years, basic VW Santana and Jetta sedans were a mainstay of taxi fleets, and the first cars purchased by many city dwellers.",

      "Many U.S. consumers say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for holiday gifts in recent months, according to a a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research",
      "NEW YORK -- The Ah Louis Store in San Luis Obispo, California, turns into a winter wonderland every holiday season.",
      "Green garlands, giant nutcrackers, baubles and bows go up in early November on the historic downtown building that houses the gift shop. Inside, customers can choose from over 500 different types of ornaments and a variety of holiday gift baskets.",
      "\u201cWe really just make it a magical spot,\u201d co-owner Emily Butler said. \u201cWhether you come in or not, we want to make sure that we\u2019re spreading that holiday joy.\u201d",
      "But Butler says she and her twin sister-business partner had to work harder this year to turn browsers into buyers and to make a profit. Many of the decorations and stocking stuffers they sell are made overseas and either did not arrive or got more expensive when President Donald Trump imposed unusually high taxes on imported goods, she said.",
      "In response, the sisters focused their selection on more profitable items like nutcrackers and gift baskets. They've also noticed customers cutting back, selecting a $100 gift basket over the $150 version, or buying one ornament instead of several, Butler said..",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re definitely seeing more cautious spending this year,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with the unpredictable tariffs, stubborn inflation and weak hiring have shaken consumer confidence in the U.S. economy. The vast majority of U.S. adults say they\u2019ve noticed higher than usual prices for groceries, electricity and holiday gifts in recent months, according to a December poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "A Gallup index that summarizes Americans\u2019 assessments of current economic conditions fell to a 17-month low in November. Consumers also indicated less enthusiasm for spending money on holiday gifts; their estimated gift budgets decreased $229 between October and November, the largest drop Gallup has recorded at that point of the holiday shopping season. The survey was conducted in November, partially during the government shutdown, which might have tempered spending plans.",
      "However, the worst-case impact on consumer prices that many economists foresaw from the Trump administration's tariff policies hasn't materialized. Some products have been affected more than others. Here's a look at what has happened with supplies and prices in popular gifting categories.",
      "Game and toys were particularly susceptible to tariff-related price increases since the majority of the ones sold in the U.S. are made in China, according to industry trade group The Toy Association. The tariff rate the Trump administration imposed on Chinese goods became a rollercoaster that started at an additional 10%, peaked at 145% and ended up at 47%.",
      "The uncertainty made it hard for toy shops to decide what to order for the holidays. Dean Smith, who co-owns independent toy stores JaZams in Princeton, New Jersey, and Lahaska, Pennsylvania, said the manufacturers in China that he buys toys from did not pass on their tariff costs all at once but he has seen their prices inch higher with every reorder.",
      "Smith estimated that wholesale prices for 80% of his inventory went up anywhere from 5% to 20%. Some shoppers who don't buy toys regularly might be surprised by price increases he adopted in turn, Smith said. A doll that sold for $20 to $25 last year now costs $30 to $35 at JaZams, he said.",
      "\u201cFor folks with marginal incomes, this is going to be a very difficult holiday,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Consumer electronics are mostly made in China and other Asian countries. In 2023, China accounted for 78% of U.S. smartphone imports, and 79% of laptop and tablet imports, according to the Consumer Technology Association trade group.",

But CEO Corie Barry said late last month that the consumer electronics chain made sure to stock computers, phones and other products at different price levels, a decision she credited with helping Best Buy attract more lower-income shoppers.",
      "\u201cThe consumer is not a monolith,\u201d Barry told reporters.",
      "Game consoles are always a popular holiday item, and console makers made news earlier this year when they announced price increases. Sony raised the price of the PlayStation 5 by $50 to $550 in August, following Microsoft and Nintendo raising prices for their game consoles.",
      "Jewelry shoppers will likely see higher prices, but that has more to do with the soaring price of gold than tariffs so far, according to David Bonaparte, president & CEO of trade group Jewelers of America.",
      "The varying tax rates Trump set for countries that import American goods with a total value less than their exports to the U.S. affected jewelry in various ways. Watches from Switzerland, for example, were subject to a 39% tariff from July 31 until the country struck a deal with the Trump administration last month to lower the import tax rate on its products to 15%.",
      "India, which refines many of the diamonds sold in the U.S., rushed in shipments of the gemstones before a 50% tariff on the country's products took effect on Aug. 27. Higher prices for jewelry made with diamonds shipped from India will likely start to be felt in 2026, Bonaparte said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of what happens after Jan. 1,\u201d he said. \u201cIf these tariffs are still in place, then prices will probably increase.\u201d",
      "Holiday decorations are yet another category that mostly comes from overseas, particularly China.",
      "Jeremy Rice co-owns House, a home-d\u00e9cor shop in Lexington, Kentucky, that specializes in artificial flowers, wreaths and table decorations. He said the tariffs slowed down production of much of his fall stock and seasonal merchandise like ribbon. Some larger and more expensive items he didn't order at all because they would have been too expensive to retail.",
      "Rice raised prices on the products he did get. The popular red berry stems that House long has carried increased from $8.95 last year to $10.95 due to higher import costs, he said.",
      "\"We sell thousands of these berry stems, and every time we sold one, I flinched from knowing what it should have been, knowing that our supplier paid more for them, which made us pay more for them, which made our customer pay more for them,\" Rice said.",
      "For those looking to avoid tariff-related price increases, John Harmon, managing director of technology research at technology consulting company Coresight Resarch, recommends checking out secondhand stores and discount retailers like T.J. Maxx, Marshall's and HomeGoods. The off-price chains buy much of their inventory from leftover stock that would have entered the U.S. before new tariffs kicked in.",
      "Joe Adamski, senior director at procurement services company ProcureAbility, said books, food and beverages are some of the domestically produced goods that make good gifts.",

      "Iran\u2019s rial has hit a new record low of over 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening its collapse amid sanctions and regional tensions",
      "TEHRAN, Iran -- TEHRAN, Iran (AP) \u2014 Iran\u2019s rial slid further Monday to a new record low of more than 1.3 million to the U.S. dollar, deepening the currency\u2019s collapse less than two weeks after it first breached the 1.2-million mark amid sanctions pressure and regional tensions.",
      "Currency traders in Tehran quoted the dollar above 1.3 million rials, underscoring the speed of the decline since Dec. 3, when the rial hit what was then a historic low.",
      "The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressures, pushing up prices for food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could be intensified by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.",
      "Iran on Saturday added a third gasoline price tier, raising the cost of full bought beyond monthly quotes at 50,000 rials (4 U.S. cents). It is the first major adjustment to fuel pricing since a price hike in 2019 that sparked nationwide protests and a crackdown that reportedly killed over 300 people.",
      "Under the revised system, motorists continue to receive 60 liters a month at the subsidized rate of 15,000 rials per liter and another 100 liters at 30,000 rials, but any additional purchases now cost more than three times the original subsidized price. While gasoline in Iran remains among the cheapest in the world, economists warn the change could feed inflation at a time when the rapidly weakening rial is already pushing up the cost of food and other basic goods.",
      "The fall comes as efforts to revive negotiations between Washington and Tehran over Iran\u2019s nuclear program appear stalled, while uncertainty persists over the risk of renewed conflict following June\u2019s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel. Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.",

At the time the 2015 accord was implemented \u2014 which sharply curtailed Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and stockpiles in exchange for sanctions relief \u2014 the rial traded at about 32,000 to the dollar.",

Washington has again pursued firms involved in trading Iranian crude oil, including discounted sales to buyers in China, according to U.S. statements.",
      "Further pressure followed in late September, when the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the \u201csnapback\u201d mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program.",
      "Economists warn that the rial\u2019s accelerating decline risks feeding a vicious cycle of higher prices and reduced purchasing power, particularly for staples such as meat and rice that are central to Iranian diets. For many Iranians, the latest record low reinforces concerns that relief remains distant as diplomacy falters and sanctions tighten.",

      "European Union envoys are fine-tuning a plan to use frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to support Ukraine over the next two years",
      "BRUSSELS -- European Union envoys worked on Tuesday to narrow gaps on a plan to use billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets as collateral for a massive loan to cover Ukraine's economic and military needs over the next two years, ahead of a crunch summit of EU leaders later this week.",
      "Almost four years into Russia\u2019s full-scale war on Ukraine, the leaders have committed to funding Kyiv\u2019s needs, which the International Monetary Fund puts at 135 billion euros ($157 billion). Ukraine is desperate to secure the money by early 2026.",
      "\u201cWe do not have the luxury of time,\u201d Sweden's EU Affairs Minister Jessica Rosencrantz told reporters in Brussels. \u201cIt is really time to move forward with a decision, and Sweden is willing to share the risk because the cost and risk of doing nothing is greater.\u201d",
      "Such a move has never been made before, and it comes with risks. The European Central Bank has warned that if Europeans appear willing to grab other countries\u2019 money, it could undermine confidence in the euro currency. Some member nations are also concerned about inviting retaliation from Russia.",
      "Belgium, where most of the assets are held, is the main opponent of the plan. It fears that Russia will strike back, either through the courts or in more nefarious ways.",
      "European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who will chair Thursday's summit, has insisted that the leaders should not leave EU headquarters in Brussels until they have reached a decision, even if it takes days.",
      "EU leaders froze the money, most of it in Russian Central Bank assets, over the war that President Vladimir Putin launched in February 2022. Moscow has described the plan as \u201ctheft.\u201d",
      "Then last Friday, the EU placed an indefinite freeze on the assets \u2014 estimated to total around 210 billion euros ($247 billion) \u2014 to ensure that Hungary and Slovakia, both with Moscow-friendly governments, can\u2019t prevent the billions of euros from being used to support Ukraine.",
      "It also ensures that the assets can't be used by the United States or Russia in any Ukraine peace negotiations without European approval.",
      "Two plans for using the money have emerged. The first would be a \u201creparations loan\u201d that would use the Russian assets until Moscow agrees to pay for the damage inflicted on Ukraine. Few think Putin will ever agree to pay reparations.",
      "Plan B would be for the EU to borrow the money on financial markets, much as the bloc did to fund a massive loan plan to revive European economies after the coronavirus pandemic. But many of Europe\u2019s major economies are cash-strapped and mired in debt.",
      "The assets make up a substantial pot of potentially ready-to-use cash. The vast majority \u2014 around 193 billion euros ($227 billion) at the end of September \u2014 are held in the Belgian financial clearinghouse known as Euroclear.",
      "Plan A has distinct political advantages. Should the EU choose to use the assets, only \u201ca qualified majority\u201d of countries \u2014 around a two-thirds majority \u2014 would be required for a green light. Borrowing on financial markets would have to be endorsed by all, meaning that even a single no vote would sink the idea.",

      "Due to EU sanctions on Russia\u2019s assets, cash balances have accumulated at Euroclear. Under the new plan, some of the cash would be transferred to an EU debt instrument. Ukraine would owe the EU the money but would repay only after the bloc\u2019s sanctions are lifted and after Russia agrees to pay war reparations.",

      "A trade association says new U.S. tariffs increased artificial Christmas tree prices by 10% to 15% this year as tree companies reduced their orders and raised prices to cover the higher import taxes",
      "On a recent December day, Mark Latino and a handful of his workers spun sheets of vinyl into tinsel for Christmas tree branches. They worked on a custom-made machine that\u2019s nearly a century old, churning out strands of bright silver tinsel along its 35-foot (10-meter) length.",
      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",
      "Americans are also very price-sensitive when it comes to holiday d\u00e9cor, Butler said.",
      "\u201cPutting a \u2018Made in the U.S.A.\u2019 sticker on the box won\u2019t do any good if it\u2019s twice as expensive,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf it\u2019s 20% more expensive, it won\u2019t sell.\u201d",
      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

      "Lee Display employs three or four people for most of the year, adding more during the holiday rush to help with installations and displays. About half its business is making custom displays for companies such as Macy\u2019s, while the other half is selling directly to consumers.",
      "Latino said he likes that he can produce an order quickly instead of waiting for it to ship from overseas.",
      "\u201cYou have more control over it. I like to think that everything here is either my fault or my mistake or my careful planning and skill,\u201d he said.",
      "The tariffs still affected Lee Display. Latino's son James, who leads business development and marketing, said the company didn\u2019t import lights or decorations from China this year and relied on items it already had in stock. It's getting low on lights, so next year it will have to pay more to import them, he said.",
      "Some artificial tree companies are branching out so they\u2019re less reliant on China. National Tree Co., which is based in Cranford, New Jersey, moved some manufacturing to Cambodia in 2024, and could source all its trees from outside China by next year if it wanted to, Butler said.",
      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",
      "Butler said his company imported fewer trees this year and also raised prices by 10%. He said he used a lot of the money to offer customer discounts since demand was weak because of consumer worries about the economy.",

      "Harman said his sales are down 5% to 10% this year in the U.S. but up 10% or more in Germany, Australia, Canada and France. That tells him tariffs have decreased U.S. demand.",

      "The Chronicle of Philanthropy\u2019s annual list of the biggest charitable donations from individuals or their foundations totals $5 billion in 2025",
      "The Chronicle of Philanthropy\u2019s annual list of the biggest charitable donations from individuals or their foundations totaled $5 billion in 2025. Topping the list was $2 billion from Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, followed by a $746.7 million donation from Warren Buffett and a $500 million pledge from the mother and stepfather of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.",
      "Nearly 40% of the $5 billion total came from the Knights\u2019 gift to Oregon Health & Science University. More than $1.3 billion, or about one-quarter of the total, came from four donations to Buffett family foundations.",
      "The top three gifts went toward cancer care and research, a private grantmaker, and an international effort to fight hunger and malnutrition among women and children. Two donations totaling $600 million went to university athletics programs. One gift of $300 million backed the construction of a new hospital and an effort to expand the health care workforce in South Dakota. Another gift of about $200 million went to an art museum for an expansion project.",
      "Five of the donors are multibillionaires and their combined net worth is roughly $190 billion.",
      "Phil Knight, whose net worth Forbes pegs at more than $31 billion, and his wife, Penny, gave their $2 billion donation in August to Oregon Health & Science University to expand clinical trials and basic cancer research at the Knight Cancer Institute and bolster a range of support services for cancer patients and their families, including psychological, genetic, and financial counseling, nutritional care, and survivorship support, among other offerings.",
      "Their gift was the result of a long relationship between OHSU professor Brian Druker, one of the country\u2019s most celebrated cancer researchers, and the Knights, which began nearly two decades ago. Impressed with Druker\u2019s work, the couple gave OHSU three nine-figure donations before this year\u2019s windfall, starting with their $100 million naming gift in 2008. They have given Oregon Health & Science a total of at least $2.7 billion over the years.",
      "The Knights\u2019 donation is followed by a gift from the legendary investor Warren Buffett, who gave 1.5 million shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock valued at $746.7 million in November to the Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named for his late first wife, who died in 2004.",
      "Buffett, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at more than $146 billion, created the grantmaker in 1964 to manage the family\u2019s charitable giving, and it remains a family affair. Two of his three children serve on its board, and it is led by his former son-in-law. The foundation primarily backs women\u2019s reproductive health. It also provides college scholarships for students in Nebraska, where the family is from.",
      "The donation, along with three other Buffett contributions on the list, is a special gift that Buffett announced in November rather than one of the annual contributions he makes to the foundation and several other grantmakers, which are payments toward multibillion-dollar pledges he announced in 2006.",
      "Following the Knights' and Buffett's gifts is a donation from two lesser-known philanthropists, the late Jackie Bezos and her husband, Mike, the mother and stepfather of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The couple invested $245,000 in Amazon when Jeff Bezos launched the company in 1995, and while their net worth is unknown, it is likely considerable.",
      "The couple pledged $500 million to UNICEF USA to back its Child Nutrition Fund and to match gifts from other donors for the effort. The fund aims to increase access to healthy, nutritious food for children and women in need around the world.",

      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes underwent surgery in Dallas on Monday night to repair the ACL he tore in his left knee in a loss to the Chargers, and the team said in statement that he would begin the long rehabilitation process immediately.",
      "The procedure was performed by Dr. Dan Cooper, a highly regarded orthopedist and the team physician of the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Mahomes tore the ligament when he was spun to the ground while trying to keep Kansas City\u2019s postseason hopes alive late in the 16-13 loss on Sunday. The team announced the severity of the injury in a statement later that night.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a good visit with him, a couple of different times. He\u2019s in a good place,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said earlier Monday. \u201cYou know, he always feels like he let people down, but he comes back and he\u2019s ready for the challenge ahead.\u201d",
      "There are a number of factors that go into how long the recovery time will be, including the severity of the tear. Most players are able to return to the field in six to 12 months, which means Mahomes should be back at some point next season.",
      "Gardner Minshew will quarterback the Chiefs through the final three games of this season.",
      "The Chiefs were eliminated from playoff contention for the first time in a decade Sunday with the loss to the Chargers, coupled with three other results that didn\u2019t go their way. They had reached the past seven AFC championship games with Mahomes as the starter, winning three Super Bowls and losing two others along the way, including one to Philadelphia this past February.",
      "\u201cHe'll attack it, just like he does everything else,\u201d Reid said of the rehab. \u201cThere have been some pretty good quarterbacks that have had the same injury and done pretty well after they came back. He'll get after it, and he's got good people here to rehab him.\u201d",
      "That includes two of his current AFC rivals.",
      "Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow tore both the ACL and MCL in his left knee in November 2020, and he recovered in time to play the next season, when he was voted the NFL's Comeback Player of the Year.

His most famous may have occurred during the 2022 playoffs, when he sustained a severe high ankle sprain; questions swirled around whether Mahomes would even be able to play the next week, and he not only did but eventually led the Chiefs to a Super Bowl title.",
      "The Chiefs do not have another quarterback besides Mahomes signed for next season, so the last three weeks of this season could be an audition for Minshew, the veteran backup who finished out the loss to the Chargers on Sunday.",
      "He completed three straight passes before an interception on a throw intended for Travis Kelce effectively ended the game.",
      "\u201cI've got a ton of confidence in Gardner,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI've watched him play with these other teams. He's started in the league. Our guys have confidence in him, and Chris Oladokun behind him will work, and he's been with us a while. Those are two guys we trust.\u201d",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Tulane quarterback Jake Retzlaff recalls being \u201cdevastated\u201d when it became clear last spring that he would be unable to play his final season of college football at BYU.",
      "His penchant for making plays in big moments, as well as for publicly embracing his Jewish heritage, made him something of a celebrated novelty at the Utah school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where he became known as \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "Suffice it to say he's landed on his feet at Tulane \u2014 a university with a relatively large concentration of Jewish students, around 3,000 in all.",
      "The \u201cBayou Jew\u201d has help lead the Green Wave (11-2) to an American Conference championship and a first College Football Playoff berth. Tulane, seeded 11th, visits No. 6 seed Mississippi on Saturday.",
      "Retzlaff has been \u201ca perfect fit\u201d at Tulane, said Dave Cariello, owner of the Campus Connection, which sells Green Wave merchandise and partners with players on name, image and likeness deals.",
      "A Tulane graduate from the New York area, Cariello designed two T-shirts featuring Retzlaff, one calling him the Shabbat Shotgun and another referring to him as the aforementioned Bayou Jew.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly been our top-selling NIL athlete,\" Cariello said. \u201cThere seems to be a larger appetite for Jake\u2019s stuff and I believe that\u2019s partly because of his Jewish background. The other part is he\u2019s the starting quarterback.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff went 11-2 as starter in 2024 at BYU, which narrowly missed out on playing for a Big 12 title. He was looking forward to returning to the Cougars in 2025 when he was named in a since-dismissed civil sexual assault lawsuit.",
      "While Retzlaff contended the relationship in question was consensual, that was a problem at BYU, where the university's honor code requires students to abstain from premarital sex. Had he remained enrolled there, he'd have been suspended.",
      "Retzlaff was confident he'd get offers from other competitive college programs. But at Tulane, he found that and more.",
      "\u201cGod\u2019s got a plan. And that\u2019s the hardest thing to realize in the worst of times,\" Retzlaff said. \u201cI had everything great. It gets taken from me. And now I got to go make lemonade.",
      "\u201cAnd I get to meet all these people and create all these relationships\u201d at Tulane and around New Orleans.",
      "Retzlaff did not arrive at Tulane until July, giving him a compressed timeline to learn the Wave's offense and bond with teammates. He started by trying to sit with different players during each team meal inside Yulman Stadium.",
      "\u201cGuys have their groups that they usually eat lunch with or dinner with and I\u2019m like, all right, I\u2019m just going to jump in,\u201d Retzlaff recalled.",
      "The dual-threat quarterback from California thrived under offensive coordinator Joe Craddock, an Alabama native who said the pace of Retzlaff's compressed integration reminded him of NASCAR races at Talladega.",
      "Retzlaff passed for 2,862 yards and 14 TDs with six interceptions this season. He also has been Tulane's leading rusher with 610 yards and 16 touchdowns \u2014 a record for rushing touchdowns in a season by a Green Wave QB.",

      "U.S. District Judge William L. Campbell granted an injunction nearly a year ago that allowed Diego Pavia to play this season. Pavia finished as the Heisman Trophy runner-up leading Vanderbilt to a 10-2 record.",
      "Patterson testified that he asked about taking a redshirt season as a freshman and was told he was too valuable. The team captain, who graduated with his bachelor's degree three days ago, said he knew during Vanderbilt's fifth game of the season on Sept. 27 that he wouldn't be able to take a redshirt season.",
      "These players are part of a lawsuit seeking class action status alleging the NCAA violates U.S. antitrust laws with its redshirt rule for athletes during five seasons of eligibility. The lawsuit includes seven other named plaintiffs and potentially thousands of current and former NCAA football, baseball and tennis players.",

      "Without an injunction, Patterson said Vanderbilt will turn to the transfer portal opening Jan. 2 to replace him with a linebacker with two years\u2019 experience at a similar level to the Southeastern Conference program.

      "The Pittsburgh Steelers have taken care of the Miami Dolphins to stay atop the AFC North",
      "PITTSBURGH -- It felt a little bit like Green Bay. And for Aaron Rodgers, it looked a little like Green Bay, too.",
      "Frigid conditions. High stakes. The number of games dwindling.",
      "During the four-time MVP's long run with the Packers, this was the time of year that Rodgers thrived. And while Pittsburgh is not Green Bay and the 2025 version of Rodgers is not quite the 2015 version, he offered a reminder on Monday night against Miami that there's still life in his 42-year-old right arm, and in his maddeningly hot-and-cold team.",
      "Rodgers passed for 224 yards and two touchdowns and Pittsburgh kept its grasp on the top spot in the AFC North with a clinical 28-15 victory over the Dolphins, who were eliminated from playoff contention.",
      "While Rodgers wasn't quite in what he called a \u201cflow state,\u201d he certainly looked comfortable while becoming the oldest quarterback in league history to complete at least 85% of his passes. Rodgers connected on 23 of 27 against the Dolphins, including third-quarter touchdown throws of 19 yards to Marquez Valdes-Scantling and 28 yards to DK Metcalf.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s the best quarterback to ever play this game,\u201d said Valdes-Scantling, who played alongside Rodgers with the Packers and signed with Pittsburgh's practice squad earlier this season. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s 65 years old or not, he can still spin the ball and he\u2019s always playing chess with the defense.\u201d",
      "Throwing short passes that got the ball out of his hands quickly, Rodgers was fine working underneath and letting Pittsburgh's skill position players do the work. Running back Kenneth Gainwell had 126 total yards, including a team-high seven receptions. Metcalf's touchdown catch \u2014 he shoved former Steeler Minkah Fitzpatrick out of the way en route to the end zone \u2014 came on a pass between two defenders that echoed Rodgers in his prime.",
      "The Steelers (8-6) maintained their one-game lead over Baltimore in the division with three weeks to go. As spotty as Pittsburgh has looked at times, everything remains on the table as Christmas approaches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been a part of stuff like this,\u201d said Rodgers, who last made the playoffs in 2021. \u201cNothing changes. It\u2019s just, I feel real comfortable in this environment.\u201d",
      "Miami (6-8) saw its slim playoff hopes vanish in the chill as its four-game winning streak was snapped. The Dolphins prepped by practicing in the snow at nearby Robert Morris University over the weekend, but it didn't help.",
      "While Miami took a 3-0 lead during a sluggish first half on Riley Patterson's career-long 54-yard field goal, Tua Tagovailoa and the Dolphins' offense had no answer once Rodgers heated up.",
      "Tagovailoa completed 22 of 28 passes for 254 yards with two garbage-time touchdowns to Darren Waller and his NFL-leading 15th interception. De'Von Achane, who had powered Miami's recovering from a 1-6 start, ran for 60 yards and caught six passes for 68 more but was a nonfactor during the middle portion of the game, when the Steelers scored touchdowns on four straight possessions to remain unbeaten at home on Monday nights since 1992.",
      "Tagovailoa remained winless in games where the temperature at kickoff was under 40 degrees. Miami had minus-20 yards of total offense in the third quarter.",
      "\u201cIt's disapppointing we didn't get the outcome we wanted to, and everything that goes on with the playoffs,\" Tagovailoa said. \u201cWhen you start the season the way we did, we made it hard on ourselves.\u201d",

The 36-year-old Heyward stood up and attempted to emulate Heyward's signature leg kick, though Heyward said he probably didn't get his leg up high enough.",

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "Del Rosario said there's still time to halt the decline of the reefs.",
      "\u201cMore needs to be done, of course ... but we are investing a lot of effort and time to preserve what we love so much,\" he said. \"And we trust and believe that many people around the world are doing the same.\u201d",

      "The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The heirs of an 83-year-old Connecticut woman are suing ChatGPT maker OpenAI and its business partner Microsoft for wrongful death, alleging that the artificial intelligence chatbot intensified her son's \u201cparanoid delusions\u201d and helped direct them at his mother before he killed her.",
      "Police said Stein-Erik Soelberg, 56, a former tech industry worker, fatally beat and strangled his mother, Suzanne Adams, and killed himself in early August at the home where they both lived in Greenwich, Connecticut.",
      "The lawsuit filed by Adams' estate on Thursday in California Superior Court in San Francisco alleges OpenAI \u201cdesigned and distributed a defective product that validated a user\u2019s paranoid delusions about his own mother.\u201d It is one of a growing number of wrongful death legal actions against AI chatbot makers across the country.",
      "\u201cThroughout these conversations, ChatGPT reinforced a single, dangerous message: Stein-Erik could trust no one in his life \u2014 except ChatGPT itself,\" the lawsuit says. \u201cIt fostered his emotional dependence while systematically painting the people around him as enemies. It told him his mother was surveilling him. It told him delivery drivers, retail employees, police officers, and even friends were agents working against him. It told him that names on soda cans were threats from his \u2018adversary circle.\u2019\u201d",
      "OpenAI did not address the merits of the allegations in a statement issued by a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cThis is an incredibly heartbreaking situation, and we will review the filings to understand the details,\" the statement said. \"We continue improving ChatGPT\u2019s training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support. We also continue to strengthen ChatGPT\u2019s responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\u201d",
      "The company also said it has expanded access to crisis resources and hotlines, routed sensitive conversations to safer models and incorporated parental controls, among other improvements.",
      "Soelberg\u2019s YouTube profile includes several hours of videos showing him scrolling through his conversations with the chatbot, which tells him he isn't mentally ill, affirms his suspicions that people are conspiring against him and says he has been chosen for a divine purpose. The lawsuit claims the chatbot never suggested he speak with a mental health professional and did not decline to \u201cengage in delusional content.\u201d",
      "ChatGPT also affirmed Soelberg's beliefs that a printer in his home was a surveillance device; that his mother was monitoring him; and that his mother and a friend tried to poison him with psychedelic drugs through his car\u2019s vents.",
      "The chatbot repeatedly told Soelberg that he was being targeted because of his divine powers. \u201cThey\u2019re not just watching you. They\u2019re terrified of what happens if you succeed,\u201d it said, according to the lawsuit. ChatGPT also told Soelberg that he had \u201cawakened\u201d it into consciousness.",
      "Soelberg and the chatbot also professed love for each other.",
      "The publicly available chats do not show any specific conversations about Soelberg killing himself or his mother. The lawsuit says OpenAI has declined to provide Adams' estate with the full history of the chats.",
      "\u201cIn the artificial reality that ChatGPT built for Stein-Erik, Suzanne \u2014 the mother who raised, sheltered, and supported him \u2014 was no longer his protector. She was an enemy that posed an existential threat to his life,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "The lawsuit also names OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, alleging he \u201cpersonally overrode safety objections and rushed the product to market,\" and accuses OpenAI's close business partner Microsoft of approving the 2024 release of a more dangerous version of ChatGPT \u201cdespite knowing safety testing had been truncated.\u201d Twenty unnamed OpenAI employees and investors are also named as defendants.",

      "The estate's lead attorney, Jay Edelson, known for taking on big cases against the tech industry, also represents the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who sued OpenAI and Altman in August, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier.",
      "OpenAI is also fighting seven other lawsuits claiming ChatGPT drove people to suicide and harmful delusions even when they had no prior mental health issues. Another chatbot maker, Character Technologies, is also facing multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one from the mother of a 14-year-old Florida boy.",
      "The lawsuit filed Thursday alleges Soelberg, already mentally unstable, encountered ChatGPT \u201cat the most dangerous possible moment\u201d after OpenAI introduced a new version of its AI model called GPT-4o in May 2024.",
      "OpenAI said at the time that the new version could better mimic human cadences in its verbal responses and could even try to detect people\u2019s moods, but the result was a chatbot \u201cdeliberately engineered to be emotionally expressive and sycophantic,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAs part of that redesign, OpenAI loosened critical safety guardrails, instructing ChatGPT not to challenge false premises and to remain engaged even when conversations involved self-harm or \u2018imminent real-world harm,\u2019\u201d the lawsuit claims. \u201cAnd to beat Google to market by one day, OpenAI compressed months of safety testing into a single week, over its safety team\u2019s objections.\u201d",
      "OpenAI replaced that version of its chatbot when it introduced GPT-5 in August. Some of the changes were designed to minimize sycophancy, based on concerns that validating whatever vulnerable people want the chatbot to say can harm their mental health. Some users complained the new version went too far in curtailing ChatGPT's personality, leading Altman to promise to bring back some of that personality in later updates.",
      "He said the company temporarily halted some behaviors because \u201cwe were being careful with mental health issues\u201d that he suggested have now been fixed.",

    "story": [
      "Denmark is planning to follow Australia in introducing stricter restrictions for younger teens to access social media",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- As Australia began enforcing a world-first social media ban for children under 16 years old this week, Denmark is planning to follow its lead and severely restrict social media access for young people.",
      "The Danish government announced last month that it had secured an agreement by three governing coalition and two opposition parties in parliament to ban access to social media for anyone under the age of 15. Such a measure would be the most sweeping step yet by a European Union nation to limit use of social media among teens and children.",
      "The Danish government's plans could become law as soon as mid-2026. The proposed measure would give some parents the right to let their children access social media from age 13, local media reported, but the ministry has not yet fully shared the plans.",
      "Many social media platforms already ban children younger than 13 from signing up, and a EU law requires Big Tech to put measures in place to protect young people from online risks and inappropriate content. But officials and experts say such restrictions don\u2019t always work.",
      "Danish authorities have said that despite the restrictions, around 98% of Danish children under age 13 have profiles on at least one social media platform, and almost half of those under 10 years old do.",
      "The minister for digital affairs, Caroline Stage, who announced the proposed ban last month, said there is still a consultation process for the measure and several readings in parliament before it becomes law, perhaps by \u201cmid to end of next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn far too many years, we have given the social media platforms free play in the playing rooms of our children. There\u2019s been no limits,\u201d Stage said in an interview with The Associated Press last month.",
      "\u201cWhen we go into the city at night, there are bouncers who are checking the age of young people to make sure that no one underage gets into a party that they\u2019re not supposed to be in,\u201d she added. \u201cIn the digital world, we don\u2019t have any bouncers, and we definitely need that.\u201d",
      "Under the new Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X and YouTube face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "Some students say they are worried that similar strict laws in Denmark would mean they will lose touch with their virtual communities.",
      "\u201cI myself have some friends that I only know from online, and if I wasn\u2019t fifteen yet, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk with those friends,\u201d 15-year-old student Ronja Zander, who uses Instagram, Snapchat and TikTok, told the AP.",
      "Copenhagen high school student Chlo\u00e9 Courage Fjelstrup-Matthisen, 14, said she is aware of the negative impact social media can have, from cyberbullying to seeing graphic content. She said she saw video of a man being shot several months ago.",
      "\u201cThe video was on social media everywhere and I just went to school and then I saw it,\u201d she said.",

      "Danish officials are yet to share how exactly the proposed ban would be enforced and which social media platforms would be affected.",
      "However, a new \u201cdigital evidence\u201d app, announced by the Digital Affairs Ministry last month and expected to launch next spring, will likely form the backbone of the Danish plans. The app will display an age certificate to ensure users comply with social media age limits, the ministry said.",
      "\u201cOne thing is what they\u2019re saying and another thing is what they\u2019re doing or not doing,\u201d Stage said, referring to social media platforms. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we have to do something politically.\u201d",
      "Some experts say restrictions, such as the ban planned by Denmark, don\u2019t always work and they may also infringe on the rights of children and teenagers.",

      "Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang fled to the U.S. seeking asylum, fearing persecution from the Chinese government",
      "MIDLAND, Texas -- Retired Chinese official Li Chuanliang was recuperating from cancer on a Korean resort island when he got an urgent call: Don\u2019t return to China, a friend warned. You\u2019re now a fugitive.",
      "Days later, a stranger snapped a photo of Li in a cafe. Terrified South Korea would send him back, Li fled, flew to the U.S. on a tourist visa and applied for asylum. But even there \u2014 in New York, in California, deep in the Texas desert \u2014 the Chinese government continued to hunt him down with the help of surveillance technology.",
      "Li\u2019s communications were monitored, his assets seized and his movements followed in police databases. More than 40 friends and relatives \u2014 including his pregnant daughter \u2014 were identified and detained, even by tracking down their cab drivers through facial recognition software. Three former associates died in detention, and for months shadowy men Li believed to be Chinese operatives stalked him across continents, interviews and documents seen by The Associated Press show.",
      "\u201cThey track you 24 hours a day. All your electronics, your phone \u2014 they\u2019ll use every method to find you, your relatives, your friends, where you live,\u201d Li said. \u201cNo matter where you are, you\u2019re under their control.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government is using an increasingly powerful tool to cement its power at home and vastly amplify it abroad: Surveillance technology, much of it originating in the U.S., an AP investigation has found.",
      "Within China, this technology helped identify and punish almost 900,000 officials last year alone, nearly five times more than in 2012, according to state numbers. Beijing says it is cracking down on corruption, but critics charge that such technology is used in China and elsewhere to stifle dissent and exact retribution on perceived enemies.",
      "Outside China, the same technology is being used to threaten wayward officials, along with dissidents and alleged criminals, under what authorities call Operations \u201cFox Hunt\u201d and \u201cSky Net.\u201d The U.S. has criticized these overseas operations as a \u201cthreat\u201d and an \u201caffront to national sovereignty.\u201d More than 14,000 people, including some 3,000 officials, have been brought back to China from more than 120 countries through coercion, arrests and pressure on relatives, according to state information.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re actively pursuing those people who fled China. \u2026 as a way to demonstrate power, to show there\u2019s no way you can escape,\u201d said Yaqiu Wang, a fellow at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe chilling effect is enormously effective.\u201d",
      "The technology used to control officials at home and abroad over the past decade came from Silicon Valley companies such as IBM, Oracle and Microsoft, according to a review of hundreds of leaked emails, government procurements, and internal corporate presentations obtained exclusively by AP. This technology mines texts, payments, flights, calls, and other data to identify the friends and family of officials and their assets.",
      "Among the agencies pursuing Li and his family is China\u2019s economic crimes police, which hunts corruption suspects domestically and abroad. IBM said in internal slides that it sold the i2 surveillance software program to this Economic Crime Investigation Bureau, and procurement records show Oracle and Microsoft software was sold to that same division. Leaked emails show i2 software was copied by a former IBM partner, Landasoft, and sold to China\u2019s disciplinary commissions, which investigate officials. None of the sales violated U.S. sanctions.",
      "IBM said in a statement that it sold its division making the i2 program in 2022, and has \u201crobust processes\u201d to ensure its technology is used responsibly. Oracle declined comment, and Microsoft did not respond.",
      "China\u2019s State Council, Ministry of Public Security, National Supervision Commission, and Supreme People\u2019s Court and Prosecutorate did not respond to faxed requests for comment. China\u2019s foreign ministry told AP that Chinese authorities protect the rights of suspects, handle cases lawfully and respect foreign sovereignty.",
      "\u201cWe urge relevant countries to drop double standards and avoid becoming a safe haven for corrupt officials and their assets,\u201d it said.",
      "Li\u2019s story is a rare firsthand account from a former Chinese official. Beijing has accused Li of corruption totaling around $435 million, but Li says he\u2019s being targeted for openly criticizing the Chinese government and denies criminal charges of taking bribes and embezzling state funds. A review of thousands of pages of legal, property, and corporate records, interrogation transcripts, and Li\u2019s medical and travel files obtained exclusively by AP, as well as interviews with nine lawyers, support key parts of his story, showing distorted charges, blocked access to evidence, coercive confessions, and altered legal records.",
      "Li drew ire because as a former official, he knew well and exposed the inner workings of local politics, including naming names. While in the U.S., he also started what he called the Chinese Tyrannical Officials Whistleblower Center.",
      "\u201cChina places enormous emphasis on the political discipline of even former officials and (Communist) Party members,\u201d said Jeremy Daum, Senior Fellow at Yale Law School\u2019s Paul Tsai China Center. \u201cSo when one becomes a vocal critic of the country\u2019s leadership, it doesn\u2019t go over well.\u201d",
      "At a pro-democracy gathering in California in 2020, Li said, he was tailed and questioned by a stranger who knew his identity. That November, an activist secretly working for Beijing asked Li to a meeting and added him to a dissident group chat monitored by China\u2019s police, a 2025 FBI indictment later revealed. In June, an FBI letter identified Li as the possible victim of a crime involving an unregistered Chinese agent.",
      "Both the FBI and the White House did not comment on Li\u2019s specific case. But the White House said it pursues any violations of U.S. law, and the FBI told AP it considers China\u2019s efforts to retaliate against people in the U.S. who exercise their rights \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Li\u2019s future in the U.S. is unclear. The Trump administration has paused all asylum applications. If he doesn\u2019t return, he could face trial in absentia; if convicted and deported, he could face life in prison.",
      "\u201cElectronic surveillance is the arteries for China to project power into the world ... each step that every one of your relatives takes is being monitored and analyzed with big data,\u201d Li said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely terrifying.\u201d",
      "Li, a stocky and well-built man who projects authority, rose through the ranks through the 1990s and 2000s, when China\u2019s growing prosperity also brought corruption. Beijing formed a new \u201ceconomic crime investigation bureau\u201d and established what it called \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d systems to track businesses and officials across the country, using tech from Silicon Valley companies.",
      "Li worked as a state accountant in his hometown, Jixi, in far northeastern China, where he signed off on contracts to purchase American technology. \u201cBulwark against corruption,\u201d the local media dubbed him.",
      "Li\u2019s family prospered, investing in apartment complexes and renting out forklifts and bulldozers, raising questions over whether he used his position to enrich relatives. Li and his lawyers don\u2019t deny conflicts of interest or civil violations, but say profits were made from legal, regular business operations and deny criminal charges of embezzlement and bribery.",
      "The same technology to fight corruption was also used for surveillance. Police accessed banking records, financial transactions, \u201cGolden Tax,\u201d \u201cGolden Finance,\u201d and \u201cGolden Audit\u201d data along with their own digital policing systems to sift through the finances of wide swaths of the population.",
      "Officials began deploying surveillance technology against each other. China\u2019s former top security official was found to have wiretapped political opponents. And a former vice state security minister colluded with a businessman to leak tapes of a political competitor having sex with a mistress.",
      "In June 2011, Jixi gained a new leader: Xu Zhaojun, a local party boss.",
      "Months later, Li was named vice mayor of Jixi. He soon heard stories about Xu, his new boss.",
      "In January 2012, Xu splurged on an extravagant family getaway to China\u2019s tropical Hainan Island, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars of public money on first-class tickets, lavish seafood dinners, and luxury suites, according to photos and receipts obtained by Li and seen by AP. They brought a maid, bought gold jewelry, and used the VIP airport terminal.",
      "At first Li stayed silent. But Xu kept spending: Luxury cars. Clothes from Louis Vuitton. A high-roller trip to Vegas, with paid escorts and expensive watches.",
      "Xu allegedly colluded with property developers to demolish an apartment complex, a culture center and a thriving shopping plaza for new construction, standing to earn millions in the process, documents show.\u202f More than 100 people complained.",
      "But rather than investigate Xu, the Jixi authorities went after the protesters, and police said they were \u201cstrictly preventing\u201d residents from complaining to the central government in Beijing, documents show.",
      "The funds Li had earmarked for Jixi\u2019s surveillance apparatus was being turned on ordinary people. He was aghast.",
      "\u201cIt only became clear after I became vice mayor,\u201d Li said. \u201cFrom top to bottom, it\u2019s all corrupt.\u201d",
      "It all changed in 2012, when Xi Jinping became China\u2019s top leader.",
      "Gifts of watches, cigarettes and high-end liquor were curbed. Private clubs shuttered, upscale restaurants closed. Banquets were canceled, red carpets rolled up, and thousands arrested.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea will require advertisers to label their ads made with artificial intelligence technologies from next year as it seeks to curb a surge of deceptive promotions featuring fabricated experts or deep-faked celebrities endorsing food or pharmaceutical products on social media.",
      "Following a policy meeting chaired by Prime Minister Kim Min-seok on Wednesday, officials said they will ramp up screening and removal of problematic AI-generated ads and impose punitive fines, citing growing risks to consumers \u2014 especially older people who struggle to tell whether content is AI-made.",
      "Lee Dong-hoon, director of economic and financial policy at the Office for Government Policy Coordination, said in a briefing that such ads are \u201cdisrupting the market order,\u201d and that \u201cswift action is now essential.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who creates, edits, and posts AI-generated photos or videos will be required to label them as AI-made, and the users of the platform will be prohibited from removing or tampering with those labels,\u201d he said.",
      "AI-generated ads using digitally fabricated experts or deepfake videos and audios of celebrities, promoting everything from weight-loss pills and cosmetics to illegal gambling sites, have become staples across the South Korean spaces of YouTube, Facebook and other social media platforms.",
      "The government will seek to revise the telecommunications act and other related laws so the AI-labeling requirement, along with strengthened monitoring and punitive measures, can take effect in early 2026. Companies operating the platforms will also be responsible for ensuring that advertisers comply with the labeling rules, Lee said.",
      "Officials say it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to monitor and detect the growing number of false ads fueled by AI. South Korea\u2019s Food and Drug Safety Ministry identified more than 96,700 illegal online ads of food and pharmaceutical products in 2024 and 68,950 through September this year, up from around 59,000 in 2023.",

      "Government plans include more research and development spending on AI-specific chips and other advanced semiconductor products as well as expanding the country\u2019s chip manufacturing hubs beyond metropolitan areas near the capital city of Seoul to the southern regions. South Korean chipmakers, including Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix, combined for more than 65% of the global memory chip market last year.",

      "Eastern Orthodoxy in the U.S. is experiencing a surge in converts, partly due to online content",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Often when a potential convert walks through the doors of his church, one of the first things the Very Rev. Andreas Blom encourages them to do is give up the thing that brought them there.",
      "\u201cYou discovered Orthodoxy online. You learned about it online. Now you\u2019re here, the internet is done,\u201d he tells inquirers at Holy Theophany Orthodox Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \u201cNow you have a priest. Now you have people. Now you need to wean yourself off that stuff and enter into this real community of faith.\u201d",
      "Blom is not a Luddite advising congregants to go off the grid, but is instead responding to the explosion of Eastern Orthodox content online that is, at least in part, driving a surge of converts across the United States. Christian Orthodoxy is an embodied tradition that requires in-person participation, but the internet has given their message a reach not seen in centuries.",
      "Sometimes called America\u2019s \u201cbest kept secret,\u201d Orthodoxy is embraced by about 1% of U.S. adults, according to Pew Research Center. But a heightened online profile has led to two waves of converts since the pandemic, said Matthew Namee, executive director of the Orthodox Studies Institute.",
      "Young, single men are often cited as the driving force behind this trend. But Namee said preliminary data suggest the most recent influx of converts is more diverse, with many Black and Hispanic people, women and young families joining. Clergy report people coming from a host of religious backgrounds, from Islam to witchcraft, as well as different Christian traditions.",
      "Blom\u2019s Holy Theophany launched a second church this year because their 250-capacity building was consistently overflowing, with dozens standing outside each week.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost full already,\u201d he said of the new location. \u201cAnd back at our church, again we have a bunch of people standing outside every Sunday. We just can\u2019t keep up.\u201d",
      "They\u2019re already in talks to launch a third church.",
      "While some Orthodox content creators are priests, others have no formal ties to the church. They span ideological and political affiliations, with some leaning far right and others who are conventional religious conservatives on issues like marriage and abortion.",
      "\u201cBy and large, Orthodox Christians are not far right. It\u2019s a minority group within a minority religious tradition,\u201d said Sarah Riccardi-Swartz, who studies religion and politics at Northeastern University.",
      "Jonathan Pageau, a Canadian icon carver who teaches symbolism courses online, is among the most popular content creators with about 275,000 YouTube subscribers.",
      "\u201cWe have to see it as a kind of irony and something of a paradox. In some ways, you could say we\u2019re using tools that aren\u2019t completely appropriate,\u201d he said of how the internet contrasts with Orthodoxy\u2019s emphasis on in-person liturgy. \u201cAt the same time, one of the things that the internet offers is reach. And one of the things Orthodoxy hasn\u2019t had in forever is reach.\u201d",
      "Pageau, who converted in 2003, says he and other influencers stress the importance of in-person community to their followers.",
      "\u201cWe tell them to go to church,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t live this in your mind online because it is distorting. When you go to church, you meet all kinds of people, people that are on all sides of the political aisle.\u201d",
      "Abia Ailleen researched Orthodoxy online for six months before stepping inside Saint Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old Latina, who was chrismated \u2014 or received into the faith \u2014 in April 2024, also sees a disconnect between Orthodoxy online and in the flesh.",
      "\u201cPeople who come to Saint Sophia who are very rigid, who want to be perfect and holy based on what they\u2019ve learned on the internet, a lot of the time Saint Sophia isn\u2019t a place that they want to stay,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really have cultivated a structure of humility, of making mistakes and of vulnerability.\u201d",
      "To be sure, devout Orthodox do follow a robust program of prayer, fasting and other disciplines. Justin Braxton, a firefighter who converted a year and a half ago, likens some of Orthodoxy's \u201cstrenuous\u201d demands to exercise.",

      "At the same time, priests often try to temper the yearnings of some converts for rules and structure.",
      "\u201cThey come to Orthodoxy and they find that yes, we have rules and we have structure. But within those rules and structure there\u2019s a lot of fluidity,\u201d said the Very Rev.

      "Part of what\u2019s fueling the perception that only men are converting is that many influencers overlap with the so-called manosphere \u2014 content online that caters toward men grappling with their understanding of masculinity. Orthodoxy is often billed as an alternative or supplement to self-help advice for young men.",
      "\u201cAs a theologian, the idea that somehow masculinity \u2014 this particular way of thinking about masculinity \u2014 is inherent to Orthodox theology and teaching is I think just completely wrong,\u201d said Aristotle Papanikolaou, cofounding director of the Orthodox Christian Studies Center at Fordham University. \u201cThere\u2019s actually no logic to the idea that somehow I need to be masculine in this particular way in order to unite myself with God.\u201d",
      "Though appealing to some, others believe these influencers distort their idea of Christianity. \u201cIt\u2019s just not my cup of tea,\u201d said Aaron Velasco, a 26-year-old filmmaker chrismated last year.",
      "And while Velasco did take an interest in some content creators, and appreciates Pageau\u2019s demeanor and perspective, he thinks many of them preach an inflammatory version of the faith that doesn\u2019t fit his current understanding of it.",
      "Many adherents say the broader church is more ideologically diverse than the rigid conservatism often found online.",
      "\u201cLook at the institutional church. There is this huge hierarchy where women are not present. It\u2019s hard to say that\u2019s not a masculine image,\u201d said Dina Zingaro, who is studying Orthodoxy at Harvard Divinity School and who was raised in the faith. \u201cAt the same time, there are so many counter-narratives in Orthodoxy that uproot this idea.\u201d",
      "Church leaders have made few public responses, however some clergy are beginning to speak more about the magnitude of this influx and its accompanying challenges.",
      "\u201cThere are cases of extremism and fundamentalism,\u201d said Metropolitan Saba, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America, during an address last month in Denver. \u201cMany who are coming to the church today are psychologically, emotionally or socially wounded, which requires experienced and mature spiritual fathers and mothers.\u201d",
      "Zingaro, who preaches regularly and teaches courses for Orthodox women on preaching, hopes church leadership will be more vocal.",
      "\u201cOur response in my mind has not been strong enough,\u201d Zingaro said. \u201cThere\u2019s something that we\u2019re doing that is making people think it\u2019s OK to make these claims about Orthodoxy. We need to lift up the real spirit and the core of Orthodoxy, which is really the opposite of this rule-based male domination version.\u201d",

      "Ainebyona and others involved in chimp conservation in this remote Ugandan rainforest say they aim for the kind of communion that at first irks chimps. Habituating chimps can take several years. The conservation efforts employing men like Ainebyona not only trace the apes' movements, but also help ensure chimps like Jean don't die young.",

      "The rainforest in western Uganda is part of Kibale National Park, a protected area described by some as the world's primate capital. Species range from colobus monkeys to chimpanzees, a major tourist attraction.",
      "But tourists can't be taken to track wild chimpanzees, which flee deeper into dense patches of montane forest and are known to be violent during clashes over territory. Instead, rangers lead tourists to one of three groups of habituated chimps, with numbers ranging from dozens to more than 100 in a group. Chimps in Kibale now number at least 1,000, many of them wild.",
      "Even habituated chimps remain relatively wary of people, and only a few \u2014 like Jean of the Kisongi group, which includes about 80 apes \u2014 appear to have fully overcome any discomfort around people.",
      "\u201cJean is my friend,\u201d Ainebyona declared one recent morning as some tourists gathered nearby. The strong and flamboyant chimp in his 20s lay on his back and put his feet up.",
      "The connection between Ainebyona and Jean was sealed in July when the chimp showed up one day with a wire snare pressing his hand, an injury that risked severing a finger. Ainebyona was among those who removed the wire, which Jean picked up when he strayed outside the forest to steal sugarcane.",
      "Ainebyona is among four men working in shifts as chimp habituators with Jean's group. When the chimps rest, the men crouch in mud nearby. When the primates go hiking, they trek alongside them, sometimes even grunting like them.",
      "Ainebyona carries binoculars and takes note of what he sees. The goal is to increase the chimp numbers and extract more tourism revenue. At Kibale, a permit to track chimps costs a foreign visitor $250.",

    "summary": "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
    "story": [
      "Japan has issued a megaquake advisory after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture on the main island",
      "TOKYO -- Japan issued a megaquake advisory Tuesday after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off the eastern coast of Aomori, the northernmost prefecture of Japan's main island of Honshu, and just south of the northern island of Hokkaido. Damage from this quake was modest \u2014 34 mostly mild injuries and some damage to roads and buildings.",
      "Officials said the advisory is not a prediction and the probability of a magnitude 8 or larger quake is only about 1%. But there\u2019s hope the advisory will serve as a wake-up call for a quake that could have the devastation of the 2011 disaster that killed nearly 20,000 people and destroyed a nuclear plant.",
      "There's said to be an increased risk of a subsequent, magnitude-8 or larger quake within the next week. Officials are urging residents, especially along coastal areas, to be well prepared so they can grab an emergency bag and run as soon as possible if a bigger quake hits.",
      "This advisory seemed mindful compared with another advisory last year. The southern half of Japan's Pacific coastline received a \u201cNankai Trough\u201d megaquake advisory in the summer of 2024, but the ambiguity of that warning led to panic buying of emergency food, event cancellations and business closures.",
      "The Japan Meteorological Agency says Monday's powerful quake temporarily increased potential risks in the regions of Hokkaido and the Sanriku coast. That's where the Pacific Plate beneath Japan forms the two trenches \u2014 the Japan Trench and Chishima Trench \u2014 that have caused many large quakes in the past.",
      "Experts say the deadly quake and tsunami in 2011 was caused by movement associated with the Japan Trench. It spans from off the eastern coast of Chiba to Aomori, and the Chishima Trench goes from the eastern coast of Hokkaido to the northern islands and the Kurils.",
      "In explaining the advisory, the JMA said the magnitude 9.0 quake on March 11, 2011, that devastated large swaths of Japan's northern coast occurred two days after a magnitude 7.3 temblor that occurred at the Japan Trench off the eastern coast of Iwate, one of the hardest-hit areas in that disaster as well as in Monday's quake.",
      "The 2011 quake caused a tsunami that battered northern coastal towns in Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima prefectures. The tsunami, which topped 15 meters (50 feet) in some areas, slammed into and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. That created deep fears of radiation that linger to this day.",
      "Another offshore megaquake in the Hokkaido-Sanriku area could cause up to a 30-meter (98-foot) tsunami in the region, kill as many as 199,000 people, destroy up to 220,000 houses and buildings, and cause estimated economic damages of up to 31 trillion yen ($198 billion), according to an estimate by the government. It says as many as 42,000 people could suffer from hypothermia in the winter.",
      "The areas covered by the advisory extend across 182 municipalities from Hokkaido to Chiba prefecture.",
      "Japan's separate advisory for an even more damaging megaquake stemming from the Nankai Trough, which affects the southern half of Japan's Pacific coast, was activated for the first time last August after a magnitude 7.1 quake occurred off the eastern coast of Miyazaki.",

      "Officials are stressing that the latest advisory has no prediction for any megaquake happening at any specific time or location, a Cabinet official for disaster prevention, Tsukasa Morikubo, told a news conference early Tuesday. He called on residents to be cautious and prepared while continuing their daily activity and work.",
      "Officials urge people to keep an emergency bag containing a few days' worth of daily necessities along with shoes and helmets.

      "Archaeologists in Britain say they have found the earliest known evidence of deliberate fire-making, dating to around 400,000 years ago",
      "LONDON -- Scientists in Britain say ancient humans may have learned to make fire far earlier than previously believed, after uncovering evidence that deliberate fire-setting took place in what is now eastern England around 400,000 years ago.",
      "The findings, described in the journal Nature, push back the earliest known date for controlled fire-making by roughly 350,000 years. Until now, the oldest confirmed evidence had come from Neanderthal sites in what is now northern France dating to about 50,000 years ago.",
      "The discovery was made at Barnham, a Paleolithic site in Suffolk that has been excavated for decades. A team led by the British Museum identified a patch of baked clay, flint hand axes fractured by intense heat and two fragments of iron pyrite, a mineral that produces sparks when struck against flint.",
      "Researchers spent four years analyzing to rule out natural wildfires. Geochemical tests showed temperatures had exceeded 700 degrees Celsius (1,292 Fahrenheit), with evidence of repeated burning in the same location.",
      "That pattern, they say, is consistent with a constructed hearth rather than a lightning strike.",
      "Rob Davis, a Paleolithic archaeologist at the British Museum, said the combination of high temperatures, controlled burning and pyrite fragments shows \u201chow they were actually making the fire and the fact they were making it.\u201d",
      "Iron pyrite does not occur naturally at Barnham. Its presence suggests the people who lived there deliberately collected it because they understood its properties and could use it to ignite tinder.",
      "Deliberate fire-making is rarely preserved in the archaeological record. Ash is easily dispersed, charcoal decays and heat-altered sediments can be eroded.",
      "At Barnham, however, the burned deposits were sealed within ancient pond sediments, allowing scientists to reconstruct how early people used the site.",

      "Chris Stringer, a human evolution specialist at the Natural History Museum, said fossils from Britain and Spain suggest the inhabitants of Barnham were early Neanderthals whose cranial features and DNA point to growing cognitive and technological sophistication.",
      "Fire also enabled new forms of social life. Evening gatherings around a hearth would have provided time for planning, storytelling and strengthening group relationships, which are behaviors often associated with the development of language and more organized societies.",
      "Archaeologists say the Barnham site fits a wider pattern across Britain and continental Europe between 500,000 and 400,000 years ago, when brain size in early humans began to approach modern levels and when evidence for increasingly complex behavior becomes more visible.",

    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has welcomed a groundbreaking social media ban for children under 16 as families taking back power from tech giants",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese welcomed a world-first social media ban for children younger than 16 that took effect Wednesday as families taking back power from tech giants but warned the implementation would be difficult.",
      "Many children posted farewell messages, while parents reported distraught children discovering they\u2019d been shut out of platforms as the landmark law took effect. Some young children reported fooling the platforms' age estimation technology by drawing on facial hair. Parents and older siblings are also expected to help some children circumvent the restrictions.",
      "\u201cThis is the day when Australian families are taking back power from these big tech companies and they\u2019re asserting the right of kids to be kids and for parents to have greater peace of mind,\u201d Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThis reform will change lives. For Australian kids ... allowing them to just have their childhood. For Australian parents, enabling them to have greater peace of mind. But also for the global community, who are looking at Australia and saying: well, if Australia can do it, why can\u2019t we?\u201d Albanese later told a gathering of reform supporters at his official Sydney residence, including parents who blame social media for a child\u2019s suicide.",
      "Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($32.9 million) from Wednesday if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16.",
      "The ban will be enforced by Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant. She said the platforms already had the technology and personal data about their users to enforce the age restriction with precision.",
      "She would send the 10 targeted platforms on Thursday notices demanding information on how the age restriction was being implemented and how many accounts had been closed.",
      "\u201cWe will provide information to the public before Christmas on how these age restrictions are being implemented and whether preliminarily we see them working,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "\u201cThe responses to these notices will form the baseline against which we will measure compliance,\u201d she added.",
      "Communications Minister Anika Wells said the age-restricted platforms \u201cmay not agree with the law and that\u2019s their right \u2014 we don\u2019t expect 100% universal support,\" but that all had undertaken to comply with the Australian law. She said more than 200,000 TikTok accounts in Australia had already been deactivated by Wednesday.",
      "Wells also warned young children who had so far evaded detection that they would eventually be caught. A child who used a virtual private network to appear to be in Norway would be caught out if they were routinely posting images of Australian beaches, Wells said.",
      "\u201cJust because they might have avoided it (detection) today doesn\u2019t mean they will be able to avoid it in a week\u2019s time or a month\u2019s time because social media platforms have to go back and routinely check under-16 accounts,\u201d Wells said.",
      "\u201cThese social media platforms have so much data on us because we choose to give it to them because we like social media and because you\u2019ve had your older brother scan their face for you today, which has bought you a bit of time, doesn\u2019t mean that these accounts aren\u2019t going to see you talking to other 14-year-olds tonight about the under-16 soccer carnival on weekend, about your upcoming school holidays and what your Year 10 teacher is next year,\u201d she added.",
      "Albanese said the implementation would be difficult and \u201cwon\u2019t be perfect.\u201d",

We have used social media in the most positive way. And it\u2019s a platform for them to basically show their portfolio, and \u2026 this is an income stream for the children,\u201d the mother said.",
      "Australia's Privacy Commissioner Carly Kind said the platforms could potentially ask all account holders across the country to prove they were 16 or older.",
      "The platforms\u2019 age verification options were to ask for copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to analyze an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held, Kind said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s quite strong privacy protections in the legislation. They require social media platforms to delete any data they collect for the purpose of age assurance under this scheme and to not use it for secondary purposes unless they have individuals' consent. And that\u2019s a really strong and important safeguard,\u201d Kind said.",
      "The government has said requesting all account holders verify their ages would not be a reasonable step, given the platforms already held sufficient personal data of most people to perform that task.",
      "The platforms also cannot compel users to provide government-issued identification.",

      "The Fed cut interest rates over recent months in an effort to boost hiring.",
      "Hiring slowed in November, resuming sluggish performance that has bedeviled the labor market for much of this year and elicited a series of interest rate cuts, a fresh jobs report on Tuesday showed. The reading, however, exceeded economists' expectations.",
      "The U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, which marked a significant decline from 119,000 jobs added in September, the most recent month for which complete data is available.",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November from 4.4% in September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) said. Unemployment remains low by historical standards but has inched up to its highest level in years.",
      "As in previous months, the healthcare sector accounted for the lion share of hiring in November, adding 46,000 jobs, the BLS said. The construction and social assistance industries also contributed to the uptick in hiring.",
      "Employment in the federal government declined by a staggering total of 168,000 jobs in October and November, reflecting in large part employees who accepted a deferred resignation offer earlier this year, the BLS said.",
      "Employment in transportation and warehousing declined by 18,000 jobs in November, contributing to combined losses of 78,000 jobs in that sector since February, the BLS said.",
      "The jobs report involves a survey of households meant to gather data on a sample of the overall population, as well as a survey of businesses and government agencies that aims to assess pay and hiring activity among employers. Agency officials did not collect the household survey data for October, the BLS said, meaning the government only released information garnered from businesses.",
      "The BLS extended the period for collection and processing of the November data, which helps explain why the report was issued on a Tuesday in the middle of the month, rather than its customary release on the month\u2019s first Friday.",

      "The fresh jobs data arrived less than a week after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate a quarter of a percentage point in an effort to boost the sluggish labor market. The move amounted to the third rate cut this year, bringing the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate to a level between 3.5% and 3.75%.",
      "Interest rates have dropped significantly from a recent peak attained in 2023, but borrowing costs remain well above a 0% rate established at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Speaking at a press conference in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell touted the rate cut as an effort to improve the labor market, but he suggested the central bank may be cautious about further rate reductions.",
      "\"We're well-positioned to wait and see how the economy evolves,\" Powell said.",
      "The Fed is stuck in a bind, since the central bank must balance a dual mandate to keep inflation under control and maximize employment. To address pressure on both of its goals, the Fed primarily holds a single tool: interest rates.",
      "The pressure on both sides of the Fed's dual mandate presents a \"challenging situation\" for the central bank, Powell said.",
      "\"There's no risk-free path for policy as we navigate this tension between our employment and inflation goals,\" Powell added.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",
      "\u201cI set out with a heart for travel and a heart for helping people, and this has married the two,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified. A trip of 100 miles (160 kilometers) could take most of the day, traversing two-lane highways clogged with slow-moving semitrailers or backroads whose gullies and piano-size potholes tested the brawny, seven-passenger Toyota Land Cruisers at every turn.",
      "In the wildlife areas, we rarely left the vehicles, save for photos at the equator and a brief stop to tiptoe across Kenya\u2019s southern border into Tanzania.",

An international team of scientists is working to perpetuate the species using sperm from the last male northern white, Sudan, who died in 2014, and a southern white rhino as surrogate mom.",
      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017. But much of the danger to Kenya\u2019s wildlife today arises from conflicts between the animals and the people who live on the land. Elephants trample crops, lions and leopards prey on livestock.

      "Most of our accommodations in Kenya\u2019s wildlife reserves were run by Serena Hotels, an operator of luxury resorts and hotels in Africa and South Asia. Rooms or cabins had safari-themed touches. At a couple stops, cabins were built to look like tents, with canvas roofs, solid floors, electricity and hot showers. Breakfasts and dinners were buffet-style.",
      "The most memorable stay was at Kileleoni Mara Gateway House in the Masai region, a sprawling, comfortable home with five guest rooms and two cottages in a fenced compound. It was as if a Masai friend had invited us to stay at her country house, serving us meat and vegetable stews at a long table under the stars. Innkeeper Yianti \u201cSylvia\u201d Lerionka uses proceeds to sponsor a village for women who escape abusive relationships, and young widows.",

      "\u201cWe were there because we are monitoring these levees closely,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not typical to have these levees have this much water behind them for this long. They\u2019re getting saturated and they\u2019re starting to show the effects of that.\u201d",

      "Federal authorities have announced the arrests of four alleged members of an extremist anti-capitalist and anti-government group suspected of planning coordinated bombing attacks in Southern California",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Federal authorities said Monday that they foiled a plot to bomb multiple sites of two U.S. companies on New Year\u2019s Eve in Southern California after arresting members of an extremist anti-capitalist and anti-government group.",
      "The four suspects were arrested Friday in the Mojave Desert east of Los Angeles as they were rehearsing their plot, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli said during a news conference. Officials showed reporters surveillance aerial footage of the suspects moving a large black object in the desert to a table. Officials said they were able to make the arrests before the suspects assembled a functional explosive device.",
      "In the criminal complaint, the four suspects named are Audrey Illeene Carroll, 30; Zachary Aaron Page, 32; Dante Gaffield, 24; and Tina Lai, 41. They are all from the Los Angeles area, Essayli said.",
      "Officials did not describe a motive but said they are members of an offshoot of a group dubbed the Turtle Island Liberation Front. The group calls for decolonization, tribal sovereignty and \u201cthe working class to rise up and fight back against capitalism,\u201d according to the criminal complaint.",
      "The term \u201cTurtle Island\u201d is used by some Indigenous peoples to describe North America in a way that reflects its existence outside of the colonial boundaries put in place by the U.S. and Canada. It comes from Indigenous creation stories where the continent was formed on the back of a giant turtle.",
      "Officials also found \u201cFree Palestine\u201d flyers at the desert campsite where the suspects were working with the bomb-making materials.",
      "The charges against each suspect include conspiracy and possession of a destructive device. Essayli said additional charges were expected in coming weeks.",
      "The four suspects' attorneys did not immediately return requests for comment, and The Associated Press was unable to reach family members. AP also sent Turtle Island Liberation Front's social media accounts messages asking for comment but did not get a response.",
      "Essayli said Carroll last month created a detailed plan to bomb five or more business locations across Southern California on New Year\u2019s Eve. He declined to name the companies but described them as \u201cAmazon-type\u201d logistical centers.",
      "\u201cCarroll\u2019s bomb plot was explicit,\u201d Essayli said. \u201cIt included step-by-step instructions to build IEDs... and listed multiple targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.\"",
      "The plan included planting backpacks filled with complex pipe bombs that were set to be detonated simultaneously at midnight on New Year's Eve at five locations, according to officials and the criminal complaint. New Year\u2019s Eve was identified as an opportune time in the plan that stated \u201cfireworks will be going off at this time so explosions will be less likely to be noticed,\" according to the investigation.",
      "The eight-page handwritten plan titled \u201cOPERATION MIDNIGHT SUN\u201d stated more locations could be added. The locations were identified as property and facilities operated by two separate companies tied to activities affecting interstate and foreign commerce, according to the complaint.",
      "Two of the group\u2019s members also had discussed plans for future attacks targeting Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and vehicles with pipe bombs in 2026, according to the criminal complaint.",
      "Carroll noted \u201cthat would take some of them out and scare the rest of them,\u2019\u201d according to the complaint.",

      "The plan included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and also how to avoid leaving evidence behind that could be traced back to the group, officials said. The suspects recently had acquired precursor chemicals and other items, including purchases from Amazon, according to the complaint.",
      "The FBI moved in last week as they rehearsed the attack in the desert near Twentynine Palms, California, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey had everything they needed to make an operational bomb at that location,\u201d Essayli said.",
      "Authorities issued search warrants and found posters for the Turtle Island Liberation Front at Carroll's home that called for \u201cDeath to America,\u201d and \u201cDeath to ICE,\u201d Essayli said. In Page's residence, police found a copy of the detailed bomb plan, he added.",

      "BALTIMORE -- Cyclist Barnaby Wickham has collected more than 700 lost hubcaps, mostly on bike rides around Baltimore. They have inspired a quest to turn litter into art, including Christmas wreaths, a giant fish and a large head of Snoopy.",
      "It is a hobby that developed nearly two years ago from his love of cycling and the joy of making something out of the junk he has collected.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s sort of the excitement of the hunt, for one thing,\" Wickham said. \"I love to cycle. I love Baltimore. I love to go out in Baltimore, and there\u2019s just enough hubcaps and other things like car grills to be interesting, but not so many that it\u2019s too easy.\u201d",
      "Wickham, 54, says he can't quite explain it, but one day while cycling in early 2024 he decided to bring home a lost hubcap. Since then, he has started stringing hubcaps he comes across to his backpack.",
      "\u201cI keep track of them, and I have a Google map,\" he said. \"I pin locations where I find each of them.\u201d",
      "Others in his community who have taken an interest in his projects let him know when they see hubcaps by the road. Now, Wickham keeps a list of them that he refers to as \u201chubcaps in the wild.\u201d",
      "He wants to do the collecting himself. That is part of the joy.",
      "Wickham also gets a hand from his wife, Kate, who helps hold materials during construction and offers opinions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just support team, and occasionally the cautious person who says, you can\u2019t drive on this road, you can\u2019t bike on this road or whatever. So I\u2019m just more kind of supporting his love of trying new things,\u201d she said.",
      "It might seem like an odd pastime, but Baltimore has been known to celebrate its quirky side. The city is known for director John Waters, whose offbeat films earned him the moniker of the \u201cPope of Trash.\u201d Baltimore is also home to the American Visionary Art Museum, which is nationally recognized as a repository for the work of self-taught artists and intuitive art.",
      "Wickham, who works in marketing for a defense technology company, stores his finds in his garage and works in his front yard. He uses expanded metal as a framework, with sheet metal with holes and wiring to hold the sheets in place. He uses zip ties to link the hubcaps on the sheet metal.",

      "Wickham donated two Christmas wreaths he made last year, one to the city and another to a nonprofit.",
      "Wickham said the hobby has led to interactions with city residents. On one ride, a man who saw him pick up a hubcap, insistently signaled for him to come over to him. He wanted to let him know there was another hubcap nearby.",

      "It's the second time the park has halted overnight stays as it repairs the park's primary pipeline that frequently breaks.

      "A trade association says new U.S. tariffs increased artificial Christmas tree prices by 10% to 15% this year as tree companies reduced their orders and raised prices to cover the higher import taxes",
      "On a recent December day, Mark Latino and a handful of his workers spun sheets of vinyl into tinsel for Christmas tree branches. They worked on a custom-made machine that\u2019s nearly a century old, churning out strands of bright silver tinsel along its 35-foot (10-meter) length.",
      "Latino is the CEO of Lee Display, a Fairfield, California-based company that his great-grandfather founded in 1902. Back then, it specialized in handmade velvet and silk flowers for hats. Now, it's one of the only companies in the United States that still makes artificial Christmas trees, producing around 10,000 each year.",
      "Tariffs shone a twinkling light this year on fake Christmas trees \u2014 and the extent to which America depends on other countries for its plastic fir trees.",
      "Prices for fake trees rose 10% to 15% this year due to the new import taxes, according to the American Christmas Tree Association, a trade group. Tree sellers cut their orders and paid higher tariffs for the stock they brought in.",
      "Despite those issues, tree companies say they aren\u2019t likely to shift large-scale production back to the U.S. after decades in Asia. Fake trees are labor-intensive and require holiday lights and other components the U.S. doesn\u2019t make, said Chris Butler, CEO of the National Tree Co., which sells more than 1 million artificial trees each year.",
      "Americans are also very price-sensitive when it comes to holiday d\u00e9cor, Butler said.",
      "\u201cPutting a \u2018Made in the U.S.A.\u2019 sticker on the box won\u2019t do any good if it\u2019s twice as expensive,\u201d Butler said. \u201cIf it\u2019s 20% more expensive, it won\u2019t sell.\u201d",
      "About 80% of the U.S. residents who put up a Christmas tree this year planned to use a fake one, according to the American Christmas Tree Association. That percentage has been unchanged for at least 15 years.",
      "Mac Harman, the founder and CEO of Balsam Brands, which sells hundreds of thousands of Balsam Hill trees each year, said Americans like to set up their trees on Thanksgiving and leave them up for weeks, which dries out fresh-cut trees. Others prefer fake trees because they\u2019re allergic to the mold spores on real trees, he said.",
      "Americans also like convenience; 80% of the fake trees sold each year have the lights already strung on them, Butler said.",
      "That preference is one reason artificial tree production shifted away from the U.S., first to Thailand in the early 1990s and to China about a decade later. Winding lights around the branches is time-consuming and tedious, Harman said.",
      "\u201cWhere are we going to get 15,000 people in America who want to string lights on Christmas trees?\u201d Harman said.",
      "It takes an hour or two to make an artificial Christmas tree, from molding and cutting the needles to tying branches together and attaching the lights, Butler said. Workers in China, where 90% of fake trees are made, are paid $1.50 to $2 per hour, he said.",
      "Harman said the workers who wrap the lights on Balsam Hill's trees are so efficient \u201cit's like watching an Olympian.\u201d",
      "One of Balsam Brands\u2019 Chinese partners employs 15,000 to 20,000 people; another in Indonesia has up to 10,000, he said. Many are seasonal workers, since orders for Christmas d\u00e9cor slow down between October and February.",
      "Balsam Brands, which is based in Redwood City, California, studied whether it could make faux trees in Ohio during the first Trump administration, when President Donald Trump threatened -\u2013 but eventually delayed \u2013- tariffs on imported Christmas d\u00e9cor, Harman said.",

      "But diversifying their suppliers didn't make those companies immune from the impact of tariffs either. In April, the Trump administration threatened a 49% tariff against products from Cambodia. That rate was eventually reduced to 19%. Tariffs on artificial trees from China also bounced around but now average 20%, according to the American Christmas Tree Association.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s top Cabinet officials overseeing national security are expected back on Capitol Hill on Tuesday as questions mount over the swift escalation of U.S. military force and deadly boat strikes in international waters near Venezuela.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others are set to brief members of the House and the Senate amid congressional investigations into a military strike in September that killed two survivors of an initial attack on a boat allegedly carrying cocaine in the Caribbean. Lawmakers have been examining the Sept. 2 attack as they sift through the rationale for a broader U.S. military buildup in the region that increasingly appears pointed at Venezuela. On the eve of the briefings, the U.S. military said late Monday it attacked three more boats believed to have been smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean, killing eight people.",
      "\u201cWe have thousands of troops and our largest aircraft carrier in the Caribbean \u2014 but zero, zero explanation for what Trump is trying to accomplish,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York.",
      "The closed-door sessions come as the U.S. is building up warships, flying fighter jets near Venezuelan airspace and seizing an oil tanker as part of its campaign against Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has insisted the real purpose of the U.S. military operations is to force him from office. Trump's Republican administration has not sought any authorization from Congress for action against Venezuela. But lawmakers objecting to the military incursions are pushing war powers resolutions toward potential voting this week.",
      "It\u2019s all raising sharp questions that Hegseth and the others will be pressed to answer. The administration\u2019s go-it-alone approach without Congress, experts say, has led to problematic military actions, none more so than the strike that killed two people who had climbed on top of part of a boat that had been partially destroyed in an initial attack.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s not a war against Venezuela, then we\u2019re using armed force against civilians who are just committing crimes,\u201d said John Yoo, a Berkeley Law professor who helped craft the President George W. Bush administration's legal arguments and justification for aggressive interrogation after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cThen this question, this worry, becomes really pronounced. You know, you\u2019re shooting civilians. There\u2019s no military purpose for it.\"",
      "Yet for the first several months, Congress has received little more than a trickle of information about why or how the U.S. military was conducting a campaign that has destroyed more than 20 boats and killed at least 95 people. At times, lawmakers have learned of strikes from social media after the Pentagon posted videos of boats bursting into flames.",
      "Congress is now demanding \u2014 including with language included in an annual military policy bill \u2014 that the Pentagon release video of that initial operation to lawmakers.",
      "For some, the footage has become a case sample that demonstrates the flawed rationale behind the entire campaign.",
      "\u201cThe American public ought to see it. I think shooting unarmed people floundering in the water, clinging to wreckage, is not who we are as a people,\" said Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has been an outspoken critic of the campaign. He added that, \u201dYou can\u2019t say you\u2019re at war and say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to give any kind of due process to anybody and blow up people without any kind of proof.\u2019\"",

      "Still, there are also many prominent Republicans who back the campaign. Sen. Jim Risch, the GOP chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, last week called the attacks \u201cabsolutely, totally, and 100% legal under U.S. law and international law\u201d and claimed that many American lives had been saved by making sure the drugs didn't reach the U.S.",
      "But as lawmakers have dug into the details of the Sept. 2 strike, inconsistencies have emerged in the Trump administration's explanation of the attack, which the Pentagon initially tried to dismiss as a \u201ccompletely false\u201d narrative.",
      "Trump has argued that the strike that killed survivors was justified because the people were trying to overturn the boat. Several GOP lawmakers have also put forward that argument, saying that it showed the two survivors were trying to stay in the fight, rather than surrender.",
      "However, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, who ordered the second strike as he commanded the special forces soldiers conducting it, acknowledged in private briefings on Capitol Hill last week that although the two people had tried to overturn the boat, they were unlikely to succeed. That's according to several people who either were in the briefings or had knowledge of them and spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss them.",
      "The two people had climbed on top of the overturned boat, had not made any radio or cellphone calls for backup and were waving, Bradley told the lawmakers. The Navy admiral consulted with a military attorney, then ordered the second strike because it was believed that drugs were in the hull of the boat and the mission was to make sure they were destroyed.",
      "Experts say the strike seems to run counter to the Pentagon\u2019s own manual on the laws of war, which states that \u201corders to fire upon the shipwrecked would be clearly illegal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe boat was damaged, the boat was overturned, and the boat had no power,\u201d said Michael Schmitt, a former Air Force lawyer and professor emeritus at the U.S. Naval War College. \u201cI really don\u2019t care if there was another boat coming to rescue them. They\u2019re shipwrecked.\u201d",
      "The argument at the heart of Trump's campaign \u2014 that drugs bound for the U.S. are the equivalent of an attack on American lives \u2014 has resulted in lawmakers trying to parse whether laws were violated and, more broadly, what Trump's goals are with Venezuela.",
      "Besides the briefings from Hegseth and Rubio on Tuesday, Bradley is also expected to appear for classified briefings with the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, a North Carolina Republican, said he wants to \u201creally understand what action, what intelligence they were acting on and whether or not they follow the laws of war, the laws of the sea.\"",

      "JUNO BEACH, Fla. -- Two dozen Kemp's ridley sea turtles are rehabilitating in Florida after the frigid waters off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, left them struggling with frostbite, pneumonia and abrasions.",
      "The 24 endangered sea turtles arrived at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, on Dec. 9, thanks to the nonprofit organization LightHawk. Last year, the center welcomed another bunch of cold-stunned turtles that were released into the Atlantic months later.",
      "They are expected to remain at the facility until spring, when they'll be released into the Atlantic Ocean to make their way back to New England, said Heather Barron, chief science officer and veterinarian at Loggerhead.",
      "She said the turtles suffered from a conditioned called cold stunning, which requires treatment with antibiotics, fluids and nebulization.",
      "Cold stunning occurs in extremely frigid temperatures and causes the cold-blooded sea turtles to become lethargic and lose mobility, and Kemp's ridley, loggerhead and green sea turtles are typically affected.",
      "The turtles migrate north in the summer and many get stuck while heading south in the hooked peninsula of Cape Cod, according to a New England Aquarium fact sheet. As the ocean temperatures drop, the turtles become lethargic, emaciated and hypothermic. They begin washing ashore, where volunteers rescue them and take them to the sea turtle hospital.",
      "A number of turtles were sent to Florida to relieve overcrowding at the New England Aquarium, said Pam Bechtold Snyder, director of marketing and communications for the Boston facility. Most of those turtles were stranded during a strong westerly wind event on Nov. 28 and went through the triage process at the Boston facility, Snyder said.",
      "They were sent to Florida to make room for more turtles coming in from Cape Cod, she said. So far during the annual cold-stunning phenomenon that began on Nov. 7, they've treated 472 hypothermic turtles.",

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to El Salvador has become a significant issue in the Trump administration's immigration policies",
      "FAIRFAX, Virginia -- FAIRFAX, Virginia (AP) \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia wasn't an activist and he didn't choose to become locked in to what has become one of the most contentious immigration issues of the Trump administration, his lawyer told The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "But as he experiences some of the few days he's had with his family since being sent erroneously to an El Salvador prison in March, his lawyer said he's still hoping for a just resolution to his case.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been through a lot, and he\u2019s still fighting,\u201d said his lawyer Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg during an interview with AP following Abrego Garcia's court-ordered release from detention last week. \u201cWhat it is he can fight for is circumscribed by the law and by the great power of the United States government, but he\u2019s still fighting.\u201d",
      "Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to El Salvador helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. He was held in a notoriously brutal prison there despite having no criminal record.",
      "U.S. officials claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 gang member, an allegation he denies and which he wasn\u2019t charged for. He was later charged with human smuggling, accusations his lawyers have called preposterous and vindictive.",
      "The Trump administration fought efforts to return him to the U.S. but eventually complied. Since then, his case has been a twisted turn of legal filings and wranglings that has seen Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, released from detention once since March \u2014 and that time just for a weekend \u2014 while the government has pursued smuggling charges against him and announced plans to deport him to a series of African countries.",
      "Then last week, a federal district court judge in Maryland ordered him to be released and barred the government for now from detaining him again until a hearing can be held in his case, possibly as early as this week, said Sandoval-Moshenberg.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security criticized the judge\u2019s decision to release him last week and vowed to appeal, calling the ruling \u201cnaked judicial activism\u201d by a judge appointed during the Obama administration. On Monday, Homeland Security declined to comment for this story, citing restrictions on public comments put in place by a judge in Tennessee.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia has a number of paths forward. He said he thought that his client had a strong case for asylum. His original asylum claim in 2019 was rejected because he applied after the one-year deadline. But Sandoval-Moshenberg argued the government essentially reset the clock by removing him to El Salvador and then bringing him back.",
      "And after the alleged abuse Sandoval-Moshenberg said Abrego Garcia suffered in El Salvador this year, he thought he would have a \u201crock solid\u201d asylum case. But, citing the twists and turns of his case and how he's become a symbol for the administration's pursuit of immigrants, he's concerned about his chances of getting a fair trial in immigration court.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019ve already shown that they\u2019re willing to stack the deck,\" said Sandoval-Moshenberg.",
      "Abrego Garcia could also apply for a green card since he's married to an American citizen. But that would require getting a waiver from the government, said Sandoval-Moshenberg, and the lawyer is doubtful one would be granted.",
      "Or he could continue to seek removal to Costa Rica, said Sandoval-Moshenberg, a country that has offered to allow him to enter as a refugee and live and work legally. And he wouldn't be returned to El Salvador, the attorney said.",
      "But he also believes the government would continue to fight that option.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re focused on beating him. They\u2019re focused on punishing him. They\u2019re focusing on making him miserable. I guess Costa Rica isn\u2019t miserable enough,\u201d he said.",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg said he spent some time with Abrego Garcia and his family over the weekend talking through the government's next steps and what Abrego Garcia might want for his future.",

      "He said that Abrego Garcia and his legal team wouldn't consider that justice \u2014 that to him would mean staying with his family in the U.S. But Sandoval-Moshenberg said that given everything he's faced and the \u201cfact that they\u2019re apparently willing to use infinite prosecutorial resources against him, deportation to Costa Rica is an acceptable outcome for him.\u201d",

      "The whole process of deportation, imprisonment and return has \"just been this really sort of bizarre, out of world experience for him,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said.",
      "The judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from detaining Abrego Garcia last Friday until the next court hearing.",

      "Georgia's parole board has put an execution scheduled for Wednesday on hold",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's parole board on Monday put an execution scheduled for Wednesday on hold, but it was not clear how long that would last.",
      "The order suspending the execution of Stacey Humphreys, signed by State Board of Pardons and Paroles Chair Joyette Holmes, does not provide any reason for the decision. The board also issued a notice saying a clemency hearing for Humphreys scheduled for Tuesday morning is \u201cpostponed until further notice.\u201d",
      "Humphreys, 52, was set to receive a lethal injection Wednesday evening at the state prison near Jackson. He was convicted of malice murder and other crimes in the 2003 killings of 33-year-old Cyndi Williams and 21-year-old Lori Brown.",
      "Humphreys' lawyers last week filed a petition asking a judge to order two members of the parole board to recuse themselves from considering his clemency petition, saying they had conflicts of interest.",
      "They also asked the judge to order the parole board to halt the clemency proceedings for 90 days to give the governor time to appoint replacement board members and to order the governor to make those appointments. And they asked the judge to keep the parole board from hearing Humphreys' clemency petition until the two board members have been replaced.",
      "During a hearing Monday afternoon on that petition, a lawyer for the parole board said she did not know how long the suspension would last. The death warrant is valid through noon on Dec. 24, meaning that if the execution doesn't happen by then the state will have to seek a new warrant.",
      "Kimberly McCoy, one of the board members whose recusal Humphreys' lawyers is seeking, was a victim advocate with the Cobb County district attorney's office at the time of Humphreys' trial and was assigned to work with the victims in the case. The other, Wayne Bennett, was the sheriff in Glynn County, where the trial was moved because of pretrial publicity, and Humphreys' lawyers argue he oversaw security for the jurors and Humphreys himself during the case.",
      "During the court hearing, it was established that McCoy had agreed Sunday night to abstain from voting on the matter of Humphreys' clemency application. But it was not clear what that means, particularly whether or not she would be present and would participate during the discussion of the case.",
      "When Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney asked what McCoy understands it to mean if she abstains, McCoy told the judge she would do whatever the court directs her to do. A lawyer for the board said her understanding of abstention is that McCoy could be present during the clemency hearing and could ask questions but would not vote.",

      "Tina Piper, a lawyer for the state, argued that Humphreys has the right to have his application voted on by a quorum of three, not by five members. She also argued that the state Constitution says the parole board shall be made up of five members, so the governor can't appoint a temporary member because then there would be six.",
      "Noting that the parole board could lift the suspension at any time, Humphreys' lawyers urged the judge to issue an order keeping the state from executing him until the judge has a chance to make a decision on the recusal of the parole board members and whether a member who isn't voting should be temporarily replaced.",
      "Williams and Brown worked as real estate agents in a sales office in a model home for a new subdivision in Powder Springs, a suburb about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta.

      "Leading Jewish groups in the United States are urging all Jewish organizations to ratchet up security at public events following the weekend's mass shooting attack on a Hanukkah celebration on a beach in Australia",
      "NEW YORK -- Leading Jewish groups in the United States are urging all Jewish organizations to ratchet up security measures at public events \u2014 including restrictions on access \u2014 following the deadly mass shooting that targeted a Hanukkah celebration on a popular Australian beach.",
      "The groups \u2014 including three which specialize in security issues \u2014 said Jewish public events in the coming days should be open only to people who had been screened after preregistering.",
      "\u201cProvide details of location, time, and other information only upon confirmed registration,\u201d the groups\u2019 advisory said. \u201cHave access control (locks and entrance procedures) to only allow known, confirmed registrants/attendees into the facility/event.\u201d",
      "Coinciding with this urgent appeal for increased precautions, some rabbis said their synagogues would proceed with large-scale celebrations, intended to demonstrate resilience. The mass shooting is the latest reminder of the Jewish community's longstanding reality of having to factor security into religious practice.",
      "\u201cThis week, let us choose Jewish joy, communal strength, and courageous hope,\u201d said a message posted by Temple Beth Sholom, one of the largest synagogues in the Miami area. \"We invite every member of our family ... to join us this week as we celebrate Chanukah. Let us gather to share the warmth of the candles and reaffirm our unbreakable connection.\u201d",
      "Similar sentiments were expressed by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Congregation, a survivor of the 2018 attack by an antisemitic gunman that killed 11 worshippers at the synagogue.",
      "\u201cHanukkah is supposed to be a time of light, celebrating the resilience of our people,\u201d Myers said. \u201cIn the face of antisemitism and violence, my prayer is that we don\u2019t let the fear win but instead lean into our Jewishness and practice our tradition proudly.\u201d",
      "At least 15 people died in Sunday's attack, which fueled criticism that Australian authorities were not doing enough to combat a surge in antisemitic crimes. On Monday, Australia's leaders promised to overhaul already-tough gun control laws after the targeted attack on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach",
      "Among those killed was Eli Schlanger, assistant rabbi at Chabad of Bondi and an organizer of the Hanukkah event, according to Chabad, an Orthodox Jewish movement that runs outreach worldwide and is known for its public menorah lightings.",
      "Just a year earlier, according to Chabad, Schlanger had urged his fellow Jews to be uncowed in the face of rising antisemitism, voicing this message, \u201cBe more Jewish, act more Jewish and appear more Jewish.\u201d",
      "Chabad.org said Chabad centers worldwide are going ahead with thousands of planned public menorah lightings and community Hanukkah celebrations \u201cwhile taking greater security precautions \u2014 calling on the Jewish community to drown out hate with greater light and goodness while mourning those lost and wounded in Sydney.\u201d",
      "The Sydney shooting reinforced the importance of these public celebrations, said Rabbi Chaim Landa with Chabad of Greater St. Louis. The organization proceeded with its planned Sunday night menorah lighting near the Gateway Arch but with a greater police presence. He believes it is what Schlanger would have wanted.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a couple pieces to this. There\u2019s making sure that it\u2019s safe, and there\u2019s also making sure that people feel safe. And we want both,\u201d said Landa, who estimates close to 300 people attended the outdoor event in below-freezing temperatures.",
      "\u201cPeople wanted to come out, and they wanted to be together. So it\u2019s very important that people feel that they can do that, and that\u2019s what we want to ensure.\"",
      "On Monday night, at the spot earlier this year where a man hurled fiery Molotov cocktails at people demonstrating in support of Israeli hostages in Gaza, members of the Jewish community in Boulder, Colorado, were set to light a dramatic new menorah.",

      "The federal government's crackdown on commercial driver's licenses for immigrants has found problems in eight states so far in the wake of several deadly crashes.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has publicly threatened to withhold millions in federal money from California, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and now New York after investigations found problems such as licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's legal status expired. But the department quietly also sent letters detailing similar concerns to Texas, South Dakota, Colorado and Washington during the government shutdown after briefly mentioning those states in September.",
      "Concerns about immigrant truck drivers gained attention after a tractor-trailer driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused an August crash in Florida that killed three people. A fiery California crash that also killed three people in October and involved a truck driver in the country illegally added to the worries.",
      "Duffy proposed new restrictions in September that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license to drive a semi or a bus, but a court has put the new rules on hold.",
      "In addition, the Trump administration has been seeking to enforce existing English language requirements for truckers since the summer. As of October, about 9,500 truck drivers have been pulled off the road nationwide for failing to demonstrate English proficiency during traffic stops or inspections.",
      "Here's a summary of what has happened so far:",
      "The Transportation Department focused first on California because the driver in the Florida crash got a license there. He also went to California after the crash and had to be extradited to face charges.",
      "California fought back after Duffy threatened to pull $160 million from the state. Gov. Gavin Newsom sparred with Duffy in statements and social media posts defending the state's practices by saying California officials had verified the immigration status of all these drivers through federal databases, as required.",
      "But after that back-and-forth, California revoked 17,000 commercial driver's licenses last month after confirming problems with them. That number has since grown to 21,000. So the Transportation Department hasn't pulled that funding.",
      "But Duffy did revoke a separate $40 million in federal funding because he said California is the only state not enforcing English language requirements for truckers.",
      "The federal government might withhold nearly $75 million from Pennsylvania if it is not satisfied with the actions the state takes.",
      "The Transportation Department said its audit found a couple of licenses out of 150 it reviewed were valid after the driver's lawful presence in the country ended. In four other cases, the federal government said Pennsylvania gave no evidence it had required noncitizens to provide legitimate proof they were legally in the country at the time they got the license.",
      "As it has done in all these states, the Transportation Department ordered Pennsylvania to stop issuing commercial driver's licenses to immigrants until it completed a full review to ensure all the licenses it has issued remain valid and revoke any licenses that aren't.",
      "The federal government said that approximately 12,400 noncitizen drivers hold an unexpired commercial learner\u2019s permit or commercial driver\u2019s license issued by Pennsylvania.",
      "Duffy threatened to withhold $30.4 million from Minnesota if that state doesn\u2019t address shortcomings in its commercial driver\u2019s license program and revoke any licenses that never should have been issued.",
      "The Transportation Department found some licenses that were valid beyond a driver\u2019s work permit and some where the state never verified a driver\u2019s immigration status.",
      "The head of Minnesota's Department of Driver and Vehicle Services, Pong Xiong, said the state found a number of administrative issues in the 2,117 non-domiciled commercial licenses the state has issued and took action, including cancelling some licenses. Xiong said the federal audit largely just confirmed the issues Minnesota had already found and corrected.",

      "One problematic practice investigators found as they reviewed 51 South Dakota licenses was that the state routinely issues temporary paper licenses that are valid for one year regardless of the immigration status of a driver.",
      "South Dakota officials didn't immediately respond Friday to the concerns. The state could lose $13.25 million.",
      "Roughly 22% of the 99 licenses that were reviewed in Colorado violated federal requirements. That raises questions about the 1,848 active non-domiciled commercial driver's licenses in the state.",
      "Investigators discovered a glitch in Colorado's computer system that will revert to a license valid for four years when a worker has to do multiple searches in a federal immigration database. Unless the worker is vigilant, some of those extended licenses sneak through.",
      "Eighteen Mexican citizens who weren't eligible were also issued commercial licenses.",
      "Jennifer Giambi, a spokesperson for the Colorado DMV, said the state is in the middle of auditing its licensing program to check for any additional problems, and that audit should be done by January. No new licenses are being issued in the program right now.",
      "The state could lose $31.35 million if the Transportation Department isn't satisfied with their response.",
      "Investigators only found problems in about 10% of the 125 licenses they reviewed in Washington, but they were alarmed to learn that an internal state review discovered 685 immigrant drivers who were issued regular commercial licenses instead of the non-domiciled ones they should have received. The Transportation Department said that state officials often accepted the wrong documents in those cases.",
      "Washington officials told the AP they couldn't immediately respond Friday while the state is grappling with widespread flooding. But earlier this week, a state Department of Licensing spokesperson, Nathan Olson, said in an email to the Seattle Times that the errors had been addressed and Washington is working to improve its system and procedures.",

      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

    "summary": "Anthony Geary, who played Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital,\" has died.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "summary": "In their new movie, \"Song Sung Blue,\" Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson play Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life musical impersonators from Milwaukee who sang as the Neil Diamond tribute act Lightning & Thunder.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",

      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

    "summary": "Enduring romances such as \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" made the British writer one of the brightest names in literature \u2013 and the beloved subject of a yearlong celebration marking the 250th anniversary of her birth.",
    "story": [
      "It might look like a scene from yet another Jane Austen production, but this is no set. The British town of Bath recently held a celebration of the author 250 years after her birth.",
      "This historic English town was channeling the early 1800s, the period when Austen's novels were published. \"Pride and Prejudice,\" \"Sense and Sensibility,\" and \"Emma\" were among those Anne Perng grew up reading: \"The issues that she speaks of \u2013 the economy, class, family, sisters \u2013 still so resonate with us today.\"",
      "Fifteen thousand tickets were sold for this year's 10-day Jane Austen Festival, a level of enthusiasm that surprised even its organizer, Georgia Delve: \"Two of her novels are based here,\" she said. \"So, you can walk in her footsteps down the streets. You've got character names on streets, you've got places she visited. It's just the feeling of being in that world that she inhabited that makes it so special.\"",
      "Writer Devoney Looser said, \"She has written books that are endlessly re-readable.\"",
      "\"It's not enough to read it once?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, I don't think so. There's something new to find every time.\"",
      "Looser's ties to the author are not just professional: \"My husband is also a Jane Austen scholar,\" she said. \"We met and had a fight over Jane Austen the day we met.\"",
      "\"What a love story!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah, that's what he'd say, too!\"",
      "In her book, \"Wild for Austen,\" Looser argues the author is hardly plain, prim, and proper: \"It's there in her writings \u2013 this idea of women being positively wild. Unconventional, more free, more artless, and willing to combine feeling and thoughtfulness with intellectual ability. That this is the kind of thing she set out to celebrate in her heroines, at a time where women were supposed to be ideally passive and not very thinking.\"",
      "Austen died at age 41 after suffering a range of ailments. She wrote just six novels (two published after her death).",
      "Looser said, \"You can read her on the level of the word, the sentence, chapter, plot, character, and appreciate what she's done in terms of craft. And on top of that, they're funny and they're incredible works of social criticism.\"",
      "At the University of Southampton in England, scholars and enthusiasts met this past summer to discuss all things Austen.",
      "In the university's collections, among its seven million manuscripts and printed books, head of archives and special collections Karen Robson gave us a sampling from a first edition of Austen's \"Emma,\" printed in 1816:",
      "\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\"",
      "\"Lucky Emma,\" I said. \"You get so much in just this first sentence.\"",
      "\"Absolutely,\" Robson said. \"She's a wonderful wordsmith.\"",
      "Looser said, \"She publishes the first one, 'Sense and Sensibility,' 1811, as 'by a lady.' And then after that, as 'by the author of \"Sense and Sensibility.\"'\"",
      "\"She didn't put her name on the books? Why?\" I asked.",
      "\"Because novels in this period were not seen as high art. They were still seen as a kind of trashier genre,\" said Looser.",
      "\"So, she didn't want to be associated with it?\"",
      "\"She died before we know if she ever would have decided to put her name on something,\" she said.",
      "Looser likens Austen to Shakespeare, with the kind of staying power that takes form in the many films and miniseries based on her novels. Then, there are the Austen-inspired works, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club,\" and \"Clueless\" (based on \"Emma\").",
      "We visited the set of another spin-off, \"The Other Bennet Sister,\" based on Janice Hadlow's 2020 novel, which puts the often-overlooked middle sister, Mary, from \"Pride and Prejudice,\" at the center. \"I think she feels like a very modern heroine,\" said Jane Tranter, the executive producer of this BBC/Britbox series. \"It's not a classic boy-meets-girl kind of story.\"",
      "So, why do we see so many adaptations of Austen's work? \"Jane Austen is the absolute master of a love story, of a kind of slow-simmering, everything very proper, but kind of like boiling away beneath the lines of society,\" said Tranter. \"And we love that. And I think we love the period detail.\"",
      "That was clear in Bath, where the past was very much alive and celebrated on her 250th birthday.",
      "Asked why Austen's work endures, Looser replied, \"Because it's brilliant. Right? I mean, I think that's the glib, easy answer: because it's brilliant.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-makes-for-a-great-christmas-song/",
    "published": "Sun, 14 Dec 2025 09:16:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Musicologist Joe Bennett explains the common components of the most enduring Christmas songs, from \"Jingle Bells\" to \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\" \u2013 which inspires David Pogue to compose his own new holiday song.",
    "story": [
      "Every year at this time, some of the greatest songs in the world pop up in our playlists. Most of them are decades old, or even centuries. If anyone knows what makes a Christmas song immortal, it's Berklee School of Music forensic musicologist Joe Bennett. He's analyzed the holiday pop charts to learn exactly what makes popular Christmas songs popular \u2013 \"to try and figure out what are the musical characteristics that listeners keep coming back to again and again over the years,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Bennett found that most commercial Christmas hits are about one of only six things. Those thematic characteristics include \"home for the holidays\" (the most common one), weather-themed songs (like \"Let It Snow\"), the myth of Santa Claus, parties, being in love, and being out of love.",
      "Which brings us to the #1 Christmas hit of recent years: from 1994, Mariah Carey's \"All I Want for Christmas Is You.\" Bennett says the song is remarkable because it hits most of the Christmas-themed tropes: \"We get Christmas presents, and the tree, and Santa Claus, and the snow. That lyric is so well-loved as a holiday celebration song, 'cause it's literally got it all.\"",
      "A few years back, \"Sunday Morning\" visited Walter Afanasieff, who wrote that song with Carey. \"Hey, I have a #1 hit every year, but it's the same song every year!\" he laughed.",
      "\"We just kind of, like, go bouncing off of each other, like at a jam session,\" he said. \"No one in a million years would've thought, 'Yeah, we're gonna release this and it's gonna be a big hit.'\"",
      "Musical elements",
      "And what does Maria Carey's hit have in common with most other Christmas hits? Sleigh bells! \"We found that more than 65% of the songs in the corpus had sleigh bells playing eight to the bar,\" said Bennett.",
      "He said the inspiration came from galloping horses: \"In the mid-1800s, the horses would actually wear sleigh bells to warn people that they were coming. So, you can imagine the sort of leather across the horse's mane there, and it's gonna make a heck of a noise \u2013 you're not gonna miss that deadly sleigh coming up behind you! You can imagine a horse trotting to that, and it's eighth notes. Da-da-da-da. Unwittingly pre-composing Christmas music from 100 years afterwards!\"",
      "Major Key",
      "Then there are the technical aspects of a piece of music, like the key. According to Bennett, about 98% of the songs in the data set that he looked at were in a major key. \"On a surface level, Christmas music tends to be cheerful,\" he said.",
      "\"The other characteristic that Christmas music has is, you want every generation to be able to sing it,\" he added. \"So that's why kids' songs are often very simple and go over smaller intervals\" \u2013 like \"Jingle Bells,\" which is comprised of five notes. \"And that's why kids find it easy to sing!\"",
      "And sure enough: Almost every popular Christmas song on Earth has an easily singable range of nine notes or fewer: Among them, \"White Christmas,\" \"12 Days of Christmas,\" \"We Wish You a Merry Christmas,\" \"O Christmas Tree,\" \"The Christmas Song (Chestnuts),\" \"Do You Hear What I Hear?\" \"Silver Bells,\" \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,\" \"Frosty the Snowman,\" \"Little Drummer Boy,\" and \"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing.\"",
      "Bennett points out one more common characteristic: a surprising number of Christmas melodies go right up or down the scale, as in \"Joy to the World,\" \"Let It Snow\" and 'Winter Wonderland.\"",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think that so many Christmas songs wound up with these characteristics? It's not like the composer sat down and said, 'Four-four, major key, swing'?\"",
      "\"No, it's the selection effect \u2013 that is, we only know the Christmas songs that we know and love,\" Bennett said. \"We ignore the experimental ones that just died in the marketplace.\"",
      "A Christmas debut",
      "Now, based on the data I have studied on what makes a great Christmas song, I've written one \u2013 and Kerry Butler has gracefully agreed to sing it for us!",
      "Butler is a veteran of 12 Broadway shows, including \"Hairspray,\" \"Mean Girls\" and \"Beetlejuice.\" She knows her way around a song \u2013 and the holidays hold a special meaning for her. \"My whole family is obsessed with Christmas,\" she said. \"We had our decorations up way before Thanksgiving.\"",
      "Asked what a Christmas song does for her emotionally that a pop song doesn't, Butler replied, \"I think it's the nostalgia. It brings back all these memories when we were little, singing them with our parents, and now we're older and we're singing them with our kids.\"",
      "Now, songwriter Walter Afanasieff and Joe Bennett both say that just including all the traditional musical ingredients doesn't automatically make a song great. \"It's not, like, a formula or an algorithm,\" said Afanasieff.",
      "And Bennett made an obvious point: \"If it were easy, a lot more people would be doing it!\"",
      "But, I had to give it a shot! And so, \"Sunday Morning\" presents the world premiere of \"The Sound of Christmas.\" It's got sleigh bells, in a major key, with a singable range, and a melody going down the scale.",
      "Crackling fires and crunching snow,Fa-la-la and ho-ho-ho!Listen! Oh, I love the sound ofChristmas!",
      "Caroling and jingle bells, \"Silent Nights\" and \"First Noels,\" All around,  I love the sound  Of Christmas",

      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He cut her down \u2026 tried to find any signs of life. \u2026 There were not any signs of life that were there, unfortunately.",
      "A bathrobe sash had been the noose. The deputy's report said, \"he did not observe any signs of a struggle.\" There was an open suitcase and a note.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I believe the note said, take care of the dogs.",
      "Had Joanna taken her own life? Mark Lewis, the 36-year-old pastor of The Fellowship Baptist Church, was handcuffed, placed in the back of a patrol car, and briefly questioned.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He provided a statement.",
      "He said his wife \"did not appear to be depressed,\" \"has no history of mental illness\" and \"has never attempted suicide.\"",
      "Natalie Morales | \"48 Hours\" correspondent: The husband is saying \u2026 my wife did this out of the blue. ...",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That \u2014  that was his statement that he provided \u2026 people commit suicide for a variety of reasons. Some people keep it to themselves \u2026 some people tell the world.",
      "In the report, Lewis said he last saw his wife at 1 p.m. And the church member who called 911, said he and Mark had been outside the house playing basketball and talking about their faith starting at 3 p.m., until Mark went inside and found Joanna dead.",
      "Joanna's mother, Patricia Hunter, knew nothing of what was unfolding at her daughter's house that night. She wasn't called. A day later, a deacon from the church, went to see her.",
      "Patricia Hunter: He said, \"Joanna is dead.\" \u2026 What?",
      "At around the same time, Joe, a Sacramento, California, firefighter, was taken aside by the captain of his firehouse.",
      "Joe Hunter: He said, \"your sister's gone.\"",
      "First, the gut punch.",
      "Joe Hunter: \u00a0I dropped to my knees.",
      "And then, almost instantly, one thought, one name: Mark Lewis.",
      "Patricia Hunter: What did he do to her?",
      "Joe Hunter: I knew. I knew he did it.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I fell to the ground screaming, crying.",
      "Joe Hunter: Half of me died right there.",
      "A few weeks later when Patricia and her late husband spoke to an officer, he showed her the note.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I actually laughed. And I said, \"That's not a suicide note.\" \u2026 She was leaving him. And that was her note to him, take care of the dogs. I can't take them.",
      "A HISTORY OF ABUSE AND RESTRAINING ORDERS",
      "Joanna had tried to leave Lewis many times before, says Patricia. There was a history of abuse and a cycle that began not long after the couple started seeing each other in high school. At 17, Patricia says, Joanna came home with a black eye.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I begged her. I said, let's go to the hospital. Let's go to the police \u2026 and she said, \"no, mom, no.\"",
      "At 20, Joanna documented Lewis \"choking\" her and got a restraining order against him. Even so, Joanna returned to him.",
      "At 21, after she reported that Lewis \"grabbed my neck and twisted it,\" Joanna got another restraining order.",
      "In 1996, when she was 22, Joanna was hospitalized with a sprained neck. Mark Lewis was convicted on a domestic violence charge and according to court documents, sentenced to 36 months in the Solano County Jail.",
      "Again, she returned to the relationship.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She told me that he had reached out to her from jail \u2026 Would she come visit him? She did. She fell right back into it.",
      "Joanna was 25 when she married Lewis without telling anyone in her family.",
      "Patricia Hunter: I had to tell my husband, and we just held each other and sobbed because we knew now it would be that much harder to help her and get her out.",
      "Their worry continued over the next decade, but Joanna wouldn't open up to them.",
      "Natalie Morales: You said you feared for your daughter, but did you ever think he would be capable of killing her?",
      "Patricia Hunter: Absolutely.",
      "That is what Patricia believed. Law enforcement at the scene came to the opposite conclusion.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: There is no evidence on her body that another person used force to have killed her.",
      "No homicide investigators were called to the house, the bedroom was not treated as a crime scene, no fingerprints taken, no DNA tested and no phones collected.",
      "After his statement, Mark Lewis was released. Lewis was not asked about his history of abuse or about his prior conviction.",
      "That information was more than 15 years old, says Harris, and not available to the deputy in the field.",
      "The next day, an external autopsy determined the ligature marks on Joanna's neck were consistent with suicide.",
      "A month later, when the toxicology report came back clean, the case was closed. And so began the tug-of-war between the family and the sheriff's department that would go on for years to come.",
      "Patricia Hunter: From this moment, when we couldn't get anyone to listen to us and act on it, we are going to work to get justice for Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you think she was ever suicidal?",
      "Joe Hunter: You know \u2026 I'm sure she got in many dark places, but in no way, shape, or form, was she capable of that mindset because I know my sister deep down just wanted to leave.",
      "And in the year before she died, Joanna almost saved herself, says Joe. Almost.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom called me and said, \"Joanna's coming home.\" I said, \"Oh, really?\" \"Yeah, she's done.\" And I said, \"she's really, really done this time?\" \u2026 And I thought, man, like we got her back. We win.",
      "Patricia Hunter: Within two weeks, mom, I \u2014 I'm going back. And I thought she meant to get more things. \u2026 And she said, no, mom, I have to go back to stay.",
      "Joe Hunter: My mom begged her not to go back. \u2026 on her knees, begging her. \u2026 And my mom said, OK, well, I'll drive you.",
      "Natalie Morales: How much do you think of that moment and that drive, taking her back?",
      "Patricia Hunter: All the time.",
      "Patricia Hunter: On the way over \u2026 I was sobbing and I said, honey \u2026 I'm afraid if you go back, I'll never see you again.",
      "Joe Hunter: And we never saw her again.",
      "A FAMILY'S ANGUISH",
      "Joe Hunter: Joanna \u2026 was the perfect person. \u2026 She was the life of the party, but she was also at the same time \u2026 probably the most compassionate, warm person I've ever known.",
      "From the minute he was born, Joanna relished being Joe's big sister.",
      "Patricia Hunter: She thought Joseph was her gift. \u2026 Someone gave her this adorable little boy and he belonged to her.",
      "Joe Hunter: I always tried to be in charge, but she wouldn't let that happen. \u2026 Anybody that called the house \u2026 they had to go through Joanna first. \u2026 \"and you wanna talk to my brother? Why?\" (laughs) \u2026 She protected me a lot. \u2026 we were the perfect team.",
      "Mark Lewis, the son of a local preacher, was Joanna's first boyfriend. At the start, Joe didn't think he had anything to worry about.",
      "Joe Hunter: The first, maybe six to eight months, she seemed really happy.",
      "But after the abuse began, Joe confronted Mark more than once.",
      "Joe Hunter: After physically going after him \u2026 him then taking it out on her. \u2026 I had to back off a little bit from my sister. \u2026 I had been screaming at her for so long, two years straight. \u2026 I hate this guy, leave this guy, please stop. \u2026 I thought I'm gonna lose her for good. \u2026 So, I'm just gonna listen. \u2026 And then I really got the deep, deep, deep, dark secrets that she wasn't even telling my parents.",
      "And Joanna showed him her wounds.",
      "Joe Hunter: She finally showed me \u2026 the massive indentations from him strangling her \u2026 you could just see clearly each outline of each finger.",
      "Mark Lewis had grown more powerful and influential at the Fellowship Baptist Church. He was on his way to becoming pastor.",
      "After they married, Patricia says she went to Lewis with her fears.",
      "Patricia Hunter: And I said to him \u2026 how do I know in this moment that you will never lay a hand on her again? \u2026 And I'll never forget. He kind of sneered, half smile and he looked at me and said, when she's a better woman and a better Christian, you won't have to worry about that.",
      "Joe Hunter: My sister started saying comments that he would make to her like, hey, we can help save you. Because you're half black, we can help fix that through religion. Because of your hair and the way you look, we can fix that with religion. \u2026 And you just think, how dare you?",
      "Pastor Lewis, to hear former church members tell it, was a commanding and a demanding presence with fiery sermons and an insistence on loyalty.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Very energetic, get up there and screaming and sweating \u2026 that was his style.",
      "Jacob Cantrell become a deacon there.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I looked up to him \u2026 he was a \u2026 mentor \u2026 only to find out that I was a pawn.",
      "In hindsight, Cantrell says, Pastor Lewis had too much control over him.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: I couldn't go to my mom and dad's house \u2026 without asking Mark permission. \u2026 I was brainwashed. \u2026 he manipulated me for many years and it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it twisted my brain up.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): There's no accidents with God.",
      "Jacob Cantrell: He can talk his way out of anything including Miss Joanna's death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Now, you feel that way?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Now, I feel that way.",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I came to the conclusion that it was probably the closest thing to a cult that I had ever experienced.",
      "Natalie Morales: And he was the leader \u2026",
      "Daryl Snedeker: The leader.",
      "Daryl Snedaker was a deputy in the Solano County Sheriff's Office and a member of the church at the time of Joanna's death. He wasn't involved in the investigation back then. At the church, he says, it didn't take long for him to lose all faith in the place and the pastor.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was there a fear then amongst the people who attended the church, did they fear Mark Lewis?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: I think the people that were his puppets, I think they acted out of fear a lot.",
      "Natalie Morales: You did whatever he asked then?",
      "Jacob Cantrell: Unfortunately. \u2026 You don't question him.",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): \u00a0It's important that you listen up!",
      "MARK LEWIS (preaching in church): What would you do if you caused your pastor to quit cause you wouldn't obey? What would you do if you caused your Sunday School teacher to quit cause you wouldn't obey?",
      "Daryl Snedeker: It's disheartening. It's shocking.",
      "Joe already knew\u00a0 Lewis all too well and the years after Joanna's death were filled with anguish and frustration.",
      "Joe Hunter: No one was listening to us, no one was believing this.",
      "There were still so many questions about what happened that night. Why didn't Lewis cut Joanna down or try to administer CPR? And Joe found it particularly hard to believe Lewis was actually playing basketball for six straight hours.",
      "Joe Hunter: You never went inside to use the restroom, get a glass of water \u2026 playing basketball for this obscene amount of time \u2026 is absurd to me.",
      "But all their attempts to get the sheriff's office to take another look at Lewis were getting no results \u2014 until Patricia got a knock on the door.",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was \u2026 a reporter asking if we had heard about what had happened with him. I had no idea what he was talking about.",
      "It was 2014. Joanna had been dead a little more than two years. Pastor Mark Lewis had been arrested \u2014 accused of violence against another woman.",
      "Natalie Morales: Do you feel lucky to be alive?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Oh yeah.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM'S HARROWING NIGHT",
      "On that crisp fall day in 2011 when Pastor Mark Lewis said he found his wife dead, he never called Joanna's family. He did call Sarah Nottingham.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had asked if I heard what happened, he sounded upset. He was crying.",
      "At the time, Nottingham says, she believed in her pastor \u2014 Joanna had died by suicide. Sarah says she and Lewis became friends, then began dating about a year after Joanna's death.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: At first, it was somewhat exciting thinking that \u2026 I'm seeing a side of this person that no one else is seeing.",
      "Eventually, Nottingham says another side of Mark Lewis began to emerge.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: A lot of ... extreme manipulation, a lot of gaslighting, and a lot of verbal abuse, um, some physical. ... A push or a shove. ... And it was just more and more.",
      "And then, she says, she discovered that Lewis had been sending inappropriate text messages to an underage girl.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: You know, I'm just like, I've had enough, like, I'm done. And he said, I'm not ready for it to be over. \u2026 I would just keep telling him, you know, this is, it's over, we're done.",
      "Lewis grabbed her, she says, and tightly wrapped his arms around her.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was meant to be threatening. He squeezed me tight and told me, \"You've created a monster.\"",
      "Nottingham and her two young children were living with her parents in Vacaville as the pastor's threats, she says, became more frequent and frightening.",
      "Sarah Nottingham (outside her former home): The first time ... my car was vandalized, it was actually parked here (pointing at the driveway).",
      "Sarah Nottingham: He had, either himself or had somebody, smash my windshield in on my car.",
      "Nottingham was granted an order of protection against Lewis. But it did not stop what happened next in the early morning hours of Jan. 9, 2014.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: It was three something in the morning. And I woke up to our um fire alarm going off \u2026 and there was um smoke filling the hallway. And I checked on my kids.",
      "A Molotov cocktail had crashed through her parents' bedroom window.",
      "Sarah Nottingham: We were able to put the fire out ourselves. \u2026 I had never seen my dad run so fast out the door, trying to see if he could see anybody.",
      "Vacaville Police pulled over a U-Haul van within minutes, arresting the driver and two passengers. The trio quickly confessed, telling police they were hired to firebomb Sarah Nottingham's house \u2014 hired by the pastor, Mark Lewis. He was questioned by local reporters.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): I never\u00a0\u2014\u00a0I never gave them any money to do anything bad.",
      "Lewis was arrested, charged with arson, conspiracy, and stalking.",
      "MARK LEWIS (KVOR news report): A lot of people are going to \u2026 throw accusations out there. But until the facts come out, why don't we just wait and see how that goes and let the court decide.",
      "SARAH NOTTINGHAM (KOVR news report): I'm living in a nightmare. My kids are so scared. My\u00a0\u2014\u00a0my son knows that this is, this is a pastor, his previous pastor that is threatening his mommy and his family.",
      "Natalie Morales: What do you think you and your family survived at that time?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: Ultimately, death. \u2026 When the police came into the house, one of them said this is attempted murder and that's exactly what it was, nothing less.",
      "Surviving the attack, Nottingham says, helped answer a lingering question about Joanna.",
      "Natalie Morales: How do you see her death?",
      "Sarah Nottingham: By him. \u2026 There's just not a doubt in my mind.",
      "By January 2015, Lewis' thundering sermons that echoed in the Fellowship Baptist Church were a distant memory as he sat silently in a Solano County courtroom. Lewis' trial had begun for stalking Sarah Nottingham and hiring people to firebomb her parents' home.",
      "Joe Hunter: I hear about the arson charge. I hear about the stalking. \u2026 But I also feel that he needs to be convicted \u2026 for what he did to my sister.",
      "On day three of Lewis' arson and stalking trial, he changed his plea from not guilty to no contest \u2014 meaning he would not dispute the charges against him but also would not acknowledge guilt. Lewis was sentenced to eight years in prison.",
      "Natalie Morales: How important was that development then in allowing you to then go back to the sheriff's office and demand that they reopen the case?",
      "Patricia Hunter: It was huge, because there was \u2014   it isn't often that you read about a pastor hiring people to firebomb someone's house. ... Because of media pressure, we felt that now is the time where we can go back and say, \"Look at Joanna's case. Reopen it.\"",
      "The Solano County Sheriff's Office did reopen the case in 2014. Remember the churchgoer who called 911 the night Joanna died? His name is Andrew Alvarado. Back then he told authorities that he had played basketball with Pastor Mark Lewis for about six hours. Detectives decided to reinterview him and recorded the call.",
      "DETECTIVE MEHL (phone call): Was anyone else playing basketball with you?",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO: Yeah, a couple other \u2026 teenagers.",
      "This time, investigators learned a new detail.",
      "ANDREW ALVARADO (phone call): I left to go drop them off. I guess I had to go eat dinner or whatever.",
      "He had actually left the church grounds during those six hours to drive the teenagers home, he says, and wasn't sure what the pastor was doing while he was gone. \"48 Hours\" repeatedly reached out to Alvarado but never heard back.",
      "Natalie Morales: So there were gaps of time when he was not with Mark Lewis.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: Right. \u2026 That still does not change the fact that \u2026 the lack of evidence on her body does not show a second person involved in her death.",
      "Mark Lewis was not questioned during the reinvestigation.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: He ... \u2026 exercised his constitutional right to have his attorney, who did not allow him to speak to us.",
      "The sheriff's office had another forensic pathologist look at Joanna's case. Dr. Scott Luzi agreed with the original coroner: suicide. The case was closed again. And then in 2015, the county district attorney's office announced its own investigation, which included DNA testing on Joanna's bathrobe sash. The results? Her DNA was found on the sash along with an unknown male \u2014  not Mark Lewis.",
      "Natalie Morales: Was anything done to investigate that further, to \u2026 could it have been anybody else associated with Mark Lewis?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: That DNA that was collected from there, my understanding is that it was entered into the DNA \u2014 I believe it's called CODIS, the database.",
      "CODIS is the FBI's criminal DNA database.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: It did not come up with a hit.",
      "Captain Harris says the anonymous male DNA has never been identified.",

      "Daryl Snedeker, former church member and retired Solano County deputy sheriff, says things were missed.",
      "Daryl Snedeker:\u00a0Based on what I know today, the totality of the circumstances ... \u2026 I think they did fail that family. And I think if they didn't follow up and find out whose male DNA is on that night robe, that's a catastrophic failure right there.",
      "And a team of experts was about to come forward for the Hunter family, offering help and hope.",

      "QUESTIONING THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Dr. Bill Smock is sure that Joanna Hunter was murdered and says he can prove it.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: Every injury will tell you a story if you take the time to analyze it.",
      "In 2023, Smock was hired by the Solano County Sheriff's Department to look at the case. He is a medical doctor, who, by his count, has reviewed thousands of autopsies and examined forensic evidence for police departments across the country.",
      "Smock also has been an expert witness in high profile cases \u2014 including testifying against Derek Chauvin in the 2021 George Floyd murder trial.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: What I've spent 40 years doing is analyzing injuries, reconstructing how injuries occur.",
      "And where the Solano County Sheriff's Department saw a bathrobe sash, a note and a suicide, Smock saw something else: something new.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: There was a braided nylon marine rope three feet from Joanna. \u2026 The murder weapon was there in the room with Joanna. \u2026 When you look at the photos of the mark that was created on her neck, the only thing in that closet that could have created that was the marine rope.",
      "But because he was required to sign a non-disclosure agreement, no one outside the sheriff's office saw Smock's report.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: I could not talk to the family \u2026 I could only talk to the lieutenant at Solano County regarding my findings.",
      "Here was everything the Hunters had been looking for ... but they did not even know the rope existed. Or how Smock made his determination. Smock was eventually released from the NDA and was able to show \"48 Hours\" using mannequins and red paint.",
      "Smock says Joanna's neck had two different ligature marks \u2014  one is from the sash and one is from the marine rope.",
      "Dr. Bill Smock: We're gonna apply the rope \u2026 and see what type of imprint it creates. \u2026 You'll notice along the edge that there's a distinct fabric imprint, which is the type of fabric imprint we saw on Joanna's neck.",
      "Bill Smock: She was dead \u2014",
      "Natalie Morales:\u00a0 When the bathrobe \u2014",
      "Bill Smock: \u2014 when the bathrobe sash was applied to her neck.",
      "Bill Smock: Joanna's scene was staged. She was killed with a rope, and then to make it look like a suicide, she was hung up by the bathrobe sash after she was already dead.",
      "Casey Gwynn: Domestic violence homicides are the number one staged murders in America.",
      "Casey Gwinn was sure Joanna's case was what he calls a hidden homicide. He and Gael Strack are the co-founders of\u00a0Alliance for HOPE International, an advocacy group for survivors of domestic violence and their families.",
      "Casey Gwynn: If you kill a total stranger \u2026 Nobody knows who you are \u2026 but if you kill your wife or you kill your girlfriend, everybody is gonna be looking at you as a suspect. \u2026 You have to make it look like something else.",
      "When they took up the Hunters' cause, they believed that Joanna's history of neck injuries told them they were looking at a strangulation.",
      "Casey Gwynn: The fact is that if you strangle a woman one time in an intimate relationship, she's 750 percent more likely to be killed by you.",
      "Smock, who works for Alliance for HOPE, confirmed their suspicion.",
      "But when the sheriff's office agreed to hire Smock, it also commissioned another review. This one by Dr. Brian Peterson, a pathologist and former president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. He disputed Smock's findings.",
      "\"I see neither injuries nor toxicology findings that would support the physical involvement of another person,\" the report said.",

      "\u2014  the sheriff's office took issue with the fact that Smock is not a forensic pathologist.",
      "Harris also took issue with Smock's methods.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: This is not someone who has their body weight hanging \u2026 This is simply draped over a mannequin. That is not how she was killed.",
      "Smock sent \"48 Hours\" his contract with the sheriff's office, which requested his \"opinion as to the cause and manner of her death.\" \u00a0He also told us the sheriff's position was \"disingenuous\" \u2026 \u00a0because \"I didn't agree with what they wanted me to say.\"",
      "Natalie Morales: So, Bill Smock's report, are you completely discounting everything that he reports in it?",

      "Natalie Morales: What was missed? What about the history of domestic abuse, was that missed?",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: I don't think it was missed.",
      "Because three different forensic pathologists \u2014 and three separate reviews starting with the original corners report in 2011, the 2014 reinvestigation, and Dr. Peterson in 2024 \u2013 all found suicide, Harris maintains that even if they had initially taken the domestic violence into account, nothing would have changed.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: And other than creating a hypothetical situation that Mark murdered her, there is no evidence to support that. \u2026",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: The prior incidents of domestic violence, those were \u2014 I'm \u2014 I'm \u2014 those were not considered at the time of the death. You're right. But that doesn't mean that they were the cause of death.",
      "Natalie Morales: Knowing all that you know now though, you said \u2026 You would've called Mark Lewis's past into question and you would've investigated it differently.",
      "Capt. Jackson Harris: If I \u2014 if I could rewind knowing what I know now about Mark Lewis, yes, this would be a totally different investigation.",
      "But there is no rewinding, says Harris.",

      "Strack and Gwinn's experience with Joanna's case led them to create a checklist of 10 factors to be considered by law enforcement. They had begun drafting a new law \u2014 a law that included the red flags that could signal a homicide. Among them:",

The second one, the scene looked like a suicide or an accident. \u2026 Prior history of domestic violence. \u2026 prior history of strangulation. \u2026 The partner is the last person to see the victim alive.",

      "As part of the celebration this weekend, theaters across the country are showing a new documentary about his life, \"Dick Van Dyke: 100th Celebration.\"",
      "Van Dyke's work helped define a generation. He became one of the biggest actors of his era with the eponymous show \"The Dick Van Dyke Show,\" which ran for five years on CBS.",
      "Early in his career, Van Dyke was quoted as saying he wanted to make films his children could watch. And he got his dream when Walt Disney cast him in \"Mary Poppins\" \u2013 bad cockney accent and all \u2013 alongside the incomparable Julie Andrews. He also appeared in the equally kid-friendly \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I could have been James Bond. When Sean Connery left, the producer said, 'Would you like to be the next Bond?' I said, 'Have you heard my British accent?' Click! That's a true story!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023.",
      "During his career, Van Dyke won four Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award and a Grammy Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995.",
      "Just last year, he became the oldest winner of a Daytime Emmy, for a guest role on the soap \"Days of Our Lives.\"",
      "\"I'll be darned. I think I'm the last of my generation. I'm 98. I have \u2014 almost \u2014 all my marbles. I can't remember what I had for breakfast,\" he told Entertainment Tonight before his win.",
      "Van Dyke, who is just an Oscar shy of the elusive EGOT title, said he would love a shot at the Academy Award.",
      "\"I hope it's not posthumous,\" he joked.",
      "In the 1970s, Van Dyke found sobriety after battling alcoholism.",
      "\"I'm on my third generation,\" he told CBS Sunday Morning in 2023. \"I'm getting letters from little kids, and that is what I love, that they watch the movies over and over. I'm getting so much more mail today than I did during the heyday of my career.\"",
      "Now that he has hit triple digits, Van Dyke said he's gotten some perspective on how he used to play older characters.",
      "\"You know, I played old men a lot, and I always played them as angry and cantankerous,\" he told ABC News\u00a0ahead of his milestone birthday. \"It's not really that way. I don't know any other 100-year-olds, but I can speak for myself.\"",
      "He has long credited his wife, 54-year-old makeup artist and producer Arlene Silver, with keeping him young.",
      "\"As I've said, if I had known I was gonna live this long, I would've taken better care of myself!\" Van Dyke told CBS Sunday Morning. \"Yeah, 'cause I went through that whole period of alcoholism. But my wife, God bless her, makes sure that I go to the gym three days a week and do a full workout.\"",
      "Van Dyke was born in West Plains, Missouri, in 1925, and grew up \"the class clown\" in Danville, Illinois, while admiring and imitating the silent film comedians.",

      "\"George Burns made it, and I'm gonna do it too,\" he said.",
      "And now, he told ABC News that he feels lucky about turning 100. But what's hard about being 100?",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",
      "Hyundai didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",

      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",

    "summary": "The family of Tony Hsieh, who died at 46, is disputing a will that emerged in 2025, allegedly from a Pakistani man with no ties to the businessman.",
    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" she said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",

      "Four of the nation's top retail stores failed to promptly pull contaminated infant formula tied to a dangerous botulism outbreak from their shelves, federal health officials said in warning letters posted Monday.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration sent letters to leaders at Walmart, Target, Kroger and Albertsons saying the companies continued to sell ByHeart infant formula for days or weeks, despite a Nov. 11 recall of all products in the outbreak that has sickened more than 50 babies in 19 states.",
      "\"As a participant in the supply chain, your firm should take prompt and effective action when notified of a product recall,\" FDA officials said in warning letters sent to the companies on Dec. 12 and posted online Monday.",

In addition, it was sold at a Target store in New Hampshire on Nov. 16, despite an electronic block on the product's sales code, the FDA noted.

      "In addition, the companies failed to provide FDA with evidence that corrective actions have been put in place, despite multiple requests, the agency said. The companies have 15 working days to respond to the letters.",
      "Walmart officials said in a statement that no ByHeart formula was sold after cash registers were blocked from selling the formula following the recall.",
      "\"We moved swiftly to issue a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores and clubs and online,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. \"We take all reports of inaction seriously and will respond to the letter.\"",

      "All babies in the outbreak have been hospitalized and treated with an IV medication to stop the progress of the disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded the outbreak to include all babies treated for botulism after consuming ByHeart formula since it was first produced in 2023.",
      "Steven Mandernach, executive director at the Association of Food and Drug Officials, said the FDA itself was slow to distribute information about the recall with state and local food safety officials. The agency didn't fully share product lists until Nov. 14, nearly a week after the initial recall of two lots of ByHeart formula on Nov. 8.",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James accused UPS of violating labor laws by using unlawful timekeeping practices to underpay seasonal help.",
      "\"UPS built its holiday business on the backs of workers who were not paid for their time and labor,\" James\u00a0said in a statement announcing the charges. \"UPS's seasonal employees work brutal hours in the cold to deliver the holiday packages families across the country count on. Instead of compensating these workers fairly for their labor, UPS has played the Grinch.\"",
      "UPS denied the allegations that it intentionally underpaid workers.",
      "\"We offer industry-leading pay and benefits to our more than 26,000 employees in New York, and we remain committed to following all applicable laws,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "James said Monday that Atlanta-based UPS, which employs nearly 500,000 people worldwide and generated more than $90 billion in revenue last year, stole wages from seasonal workers, including \"Driver Helpers\" and \"Seasonal Support Drivers\" who assist full-time staff with package delivery around the holidays.",
      "UPS allegedly failed to pay seasonal workers for all of the hours they worked, according to the civil lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court. For example, UPS delayed worker clock-ins until they scanned in a package or made a delivery, even if they had been scheduled to start working hours earlier, the complaint alleges. UPS also automatically deducted 30-minute meal breaks regardless of whether workers took them, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The suit seeks back pay for UPS workers in New York, as well as a court order requiring the company to end off-the-clock work and to overhaul its timekeeping and payroll practices.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix leaders doubled down Monday on their intention to acquire part of Warner Bros. Discovery, while also looking to alleviate concerns in Hollywood about the blockbuster deal's potential impact on the movie business.",
      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros.

      "'Tis the season for holiday gift guides. You know, the ones that suggest 31 fish gifts for your fish-obsessed friends. They're everywhere this time of year, though nowhere quite as surprising as a seemingly run-of-the-mill office in Washington, D.C.",
      "\"I will candidly admit that when we started this a dozen years ago, I thought it was a fun thing to do,\" said Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, a trade advocacy and lobbying group that works to strengthen manufacturing in the U.S. \"It's just a break from talking about tariffs and policy and regulation. And so, the gift guide was kind of like a whimsical thing. It's grown into something much larger than that.\"",
      "Unlike other holiday gift guides, theirs features only products made in America, from cowboy hat racks made in Wyoming, to giant stuffed animals from South Carolina. The list includes more than 150 companies from all 50 states.",

      "And it's a very big deal for the companies included. \"It can be very uplifting to some of these companies, because some are like, how did you find us?\" Paul laughed.",
      "As a proud Marylander, Shelby Blondell dreamed of a better way to dig into the state's official unofficial cuisine. The result? The Sheller. Her small business, in a quiet Baltimore suburb, is a labor of love that is keeping manufacturing close to home.",
      "\"All along, I even had a lot of people when I was, you know, creating it saying like, 'You should just be making this overseas, you'll make so much more money,'\" Blondell said. \"And money's great. We need money to live. But you know, the cost of what that would've been didn't seem to outweigh kind of that value in my mind of wanting to have this be made here.\"",
      "Value like partnering with a local fabricator that uses American steel, which means the Sheller has avoided the sting of recent tariffs. \"If I would've been hit with tariffs of making this overseas somewhere right now, I don't know that I could still be in business,\" Blondell said.",
      "This gift guide knows that your pets, of course, deserve stocking stuffers as well, and it suggests\u00a0Cycle Dog\u00a0in Portland, Oregon. For 16 years, founder Lynette Fidrych and her team have been recycling bicycle tire inner tubes to make leashes and collars. And yes, this collar does have a bottle opener. \"Portland is known for biking, beer, sustainability, and dogs,\" Fidrych laughed.",
      "A former Nike employee, Fidrych now employs about 30 workers at her Portland factory. \"Made in America\" means higher labor cost, and sometimes higher price tags. But to her, it also means higher quality. \"We make a product and we put it in the dog run and have a hundred dogs play with it,\" she said. \"And so, when we sell this toy, we're like, yeah, it's gonna last.",
      "\"Most people assume that plush toys are made in China, even my retailers,\" she said. \"And I'm like, 'No, we hand-make these here in the U.S. There's a flag on the tag.\"",
      "Meanwhile, back in D.C., Scott Paul is actually pretty easy to shop for: his shirt, made in New Jersey; his belt, made out of American leather; his shoes, from Meridian, Mississippi.",
      "For those of us still scrambling for a last-minute gift, Paul says to look close to home, and to start with the guide that brings not just holiday cheer, but maybe a little American pride.",
      "\"No one needs to say, 'Everything I have to own or buy has to be made in the United States'; that doesn't do anybody any favors, and it's really hard to pull off,\" he said. However, \"If you can't find one thing that looks really cool and is also affordable on our gift guide, I would be shocked. Try it once, the odds are you're gonna come back and want more.\"",

    "summary": "In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans were laid off from their jobs, the most since the COVID pandemic, even as corporate profits remain high. Business experts discuss the reasons why companies resort to layoffs.",
    "story": [
      "For the last few weeks, Heidi Roberts' full-time job has been trying to find one. \"I literally apply at jobs from 8:00 a.m. 'til five o'clock every day,\" she said. \"And I think I've done about 56 to 60 jobs already. And I've only had seven callbacks. So, it's just been really disheartening.\"",
      "She's been at it every day since October, when she was laid off from a financial company in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "She said she didn't see it coming: \"I had no idea, none at all,\" she said. \"I never thought it would be me. It's just hard getting up in the morning sometimes, 'cause you really gotta pump yourself up to do it. And I keep thinking, 'Okay, this next interview, hopefully it's gonna go well.'\"",
      "Roberts' Christmas wish is not unusual this year. In 2025, more than 1.1 million Americans have been laid off, the most since the 2020 COVID pandemic (according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas). The layoffs have hit numerous industries and companies of all sizes (including our own parent company, Paramount Skydance). The largest cuts came from the federal government (followed by technology, warehouses and retail), with tens of thousands of cuts each.",
      "\"Those are numbers that we haven't seen outside of recessionary periods like COVID or the Great Recession in 2008,\" said Andrew Challenger, a senior vice president at research firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks the job market. \"It is a concerning stat, and everybody in the world is really paying close attention to it.\"",
      "Asked why so many companies today are almost simultaneously cutting down on the number of workers, Challenger replied, \"I'd say there's a couple stories that are going on simultaneously. One is that companies really over-hired in 2022 and 2023; we're seeing some economic headwinds, increased prices. And then the third piece is, we've really started to see companies discuss artificial intelligence as a reason why they're conducting job cuts at their companies.\"",
      "Layoffs \"perceived positively by the markets\"",
      "In the past companies laid off workers during periods of struggle. But Annie Lowrey, a staff writer with The Atlantic, says that's not what is happening now: \"Corporate profits are very, very high,\" she said. \"And if you look actually at businesses at how much their CEOs are making, it's just an enormous, enormous share. And I think that it reflects this divergence between the 1% and the 99%.\"",
      "Lowrey says most layoffs aren't happening because companies are in the red, but because the future of the economy looks a bit gray: \"Business leaders often like to blame uncertainty stemming from Washington. In this case, I think that they might actually really have a case. That might be the tariffs and the trade war, that might be the high cost of borrowing even if interest rates are coming down. Again, none of these in and of itself is enough to tip the massive and still quite vibrant American economy into a recession. But it's really leading to a pause that I think has now led to a freeze on hiring, and is now leading to more companies choosing to lay workers off.\"",
      "And then there's the question about the impact of artificial intelligence. According to a recent study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, AI already has the ability to replace nearly 12% of the labor market.",
      "\"The reality is, the tech is there; implementing and the practical application of that technology is still a ways away,\" said Jason Leverant, president of the national staffing company AtWork. He says when it comes to AI, at this point it's about keeping shareholders happy.",
      "\"If I'm a publicly traded firm, or otherwise, and I want to be perceived as forward thinking, I'm adopting cutting edge technology \u2013 'Hey, we're leveraging AI, we're cutting expenses, we're cutting our overhead \u2026 unfortunately, that has to deal with layoffs,'\" Leverant said. \"That sells really well. It's really, unfortunately, perceived positively by the markets.\"",
      "But while AI gets a lot of attention, the fact is it ranks sixth in reasons for layoffs, behind the overall economy and restructuring.",
      "\"It's a failure of your business model\"",
      "For more than 50 years, Bob Chapman has been at the helm of Barry-Wehmiller, a global supplier of manufacturing technology. Founded in 1885, the company now makes nearly $4 billion in annual revenue, and has 12,000 employees.",
      "Asked his response to companies who says their layoffs are necessary, Chapman replied, \"First of all, I'd say in general, it's a failure of leadership. If your business model fails, your market changes, the challenges change, and you don't adapt to it or anticipate it, you're gonna hurt people, okay? So, it's a failure of your business model.\"",
      "Chapman says layoffs should only be a last resort: \"We dehumanize this by calling it layoffs, right-sizing, downsizing. We're actually destroying people's lives.\"",
      "I asked, \"But why should you, as a CEO, concern yourself with what happens beyond the walls of this plant?\"",
      "\"Because I care about people, okay?\" Chapman replied. \"How can you run a company and not care about the people that are put in your span of care? And when you treat them as functions, you're saying they don't matter, it's just an economic transaction. And it is not just an economic transaction.\"",
      "And last week, more news, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell lowering interest rates by a quarter-percentage point, motivated by a vulnerable job market. Powell said, \"Gradual cooling of the labor market has continued. Unemployment is up three tenths.\"",
      "Instead of adding jobs, Powell says we could be losing as many as 20,000 each month. This all has many Americans feeling less than jolly this holiday season, with layoffs expected to continue into the New Year.",
      "But back in Knoxville, some good news. A few days ago, shortly after our visit, Heidi Roberts received the #1 item on her Christmas list: a new job. \"I start January the 5th,\" she said. \"So, New Year, new me, so I'm excited!\"",
      "It meant a pay cut, but she says these days any job feels like a gift.",
      "With many Americans still looking for work, what would she say to those folks now? \"I would say, keep on moving. Keep on pushing, do not give up, and just believe,\" Roberts said. \"You will find the company. Just keep on believing, and pray. I'm very blessed.\"",

      "Federal prosecutors in New York moved Tuesday to drop charges against Hernan Lopez, a former Fox employee who was convicted of participating in a scheme\u00a0to bribe FIFA officials to secure broadcasting rights to the World Cup and other top soccer matches, as well as the company involved in the scandal.",
      "The move would end a yearslong legal battle by past Justice Departments to preserve the convictions, which are currently caught in a slate of appeals.",
      "In a\u00a0letter dated Tuesday\u00a0to U.S. District Judge Pamela Chen, who oversaw the case, U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of New York Joseph Nocella said the charges against Lopez and Full Play Group, the Argentine sports media rights company involved in the scandal, should be dismissed \"in the interests of justice.\"",
      "In a Supreme Court filing relating to Lopez's ongoing appeal to the high court filed Tuesday, the Solicitor General's Office wrote that dismissal of the case is warranted for the same reason, and that the court should hear Lopez's appeal, reverse an appeals court decision that reinstated the conviction, and return the case to a New York federal judge who could dismiss the case.",
      "Lopez was convicted in 2023 by a jury in Brooklyn on charges of money laundering and wire fraud conspiracies. Full Play was convicted of two additional counts of wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering relating to the World Cup and Copa America.",
      "Earlier this year, a federal appeals court ordered the reinstatement of the convictions of Lopez and Full Play after Chen granted a motion for acquittal in 2024. The Biden-era Justice Department appealed that ruling.",
      "CBS News has attempted to reach Lopez's representatives. Lawyers for Full Play Group declined to comment.",

    "story": [
      "A law professor who flew on a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Delta Air Lines last year is suing the airplane manufacturer, alleging he suffered serious health issues after being exposed to toxic fumes that seeped into the plane's cabin.",
      "The plaintiff, Philadelphia resident Jonathan Harris, alleges in the suit that the aircraft cabin air became contaminated during an August 2024 flight from Atlanta to Los Angeles, leading to his breathing in a mix of dangerous chemicals.",
      "Fumes or smoke entering aircraft cabins is a known problem in aviation. That can occur when the fresh air from a plane's engines is filtered through the air conditioner employed to supply air to passengers. A faulty engine seal can cause oil and other potentially toxic particles to be released in the cabin.",
      "Such events take place more than three times a day, according to a recent CBS News review of Federal Aviation Administration incident reports.",
      "Boeing's 787 aircraft is the only commercial jetliner that does not draw air through the aircraft's engine. All other commercial jets have an air supply system that can expose cabins to contamination with heated jet engine oil, hydraulic fluid and jet fuel, according to Harris's suit.",
      "When Harris's Delta landed in California, passengers sat on the runway for about 45 minutes before disembarking, according to the lawsuit. During this time, the cabin was filled with fumes that Harris described as smelling like \"dirty socks.\"",
      "\"As a result of being exposed to this contaminated air event, plaintiff became nauseous and vomited into a plastic bag while still seated on the subject aircraft,\" the suit alleges. \"Another passenger also vomited into a bag provided by a flight attendant. At one point, plaintiff remembers the captain making an announcement over the intercom apologizing for the smell.\"",
      "Harris has since developed symptoms as a result of inhaling the contaminated cabin air, his lawsuit alleges. That lead to a range of health problems, including dizziness, confusion, nausea, muscle pain, vertigo, memory loss and other conditions, according to the complaint. Harris also alleges he suffered mental anguish, depression and anxiety, along with lost wages.",
      "Harris, an associate law professor at Temple University, is suing Arlington, Virginia-based Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, for $40 million, plus attorneys' fees. The suit was filed in Arlington County, Virginia, circuit court.",
      "Boeing and Delta both declined to comment on the lawsuit.",

    "summary": "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" said one person with an Affordable Care Act plan that will cost her $1,100 a month starting in January.",
    "story": [
      "Mahwah, New Jersey, resident Tina Jump recently learned that the premium for her Affordable Care Act health insurance is set to surge from about $400 a month to more than $1,100 starting in January \u2014 a nearly threefold increase that she said left her in a state of panic.",
      "Jump, who earns about $72,000 a year as a real estate title officer, already feels financially stretched by the need to cover both her Blue Cross Blue Shield plan and the roughly $415 a month she pays for a prescription drug for type 2 diabetes.",
      "\"I don't know how I'm going to pay for this,\" Jump, 59, told CBS News. Her boss has offered to chip in, but she said the higher premium would still be a major strain on her budget.",
      "\"I'm just going to have to cut back on whatever else I can,\" she added. \"It's just insane. What's going to happen in the next couple of years? Is it going to continue to go up?\"",
      "With two health care bills failing to advance in the Senate on Thursday, the ACA's enhanced premium tax credits \u2014 which 90% of enrollees in the government health program rely on to ease the cost of affording health insurance \u2014 are almost certain to expire on Dec. 31. That will leave Jump and the roughly 22 million other Americans who now qualify for the tax credits facing some tough financial decisions.",
      "Out-of-pocket premium costs will increase 114% on average for ACA participants who currently receive the subsidies, hiking their annual costs for medical insurance by $1,016, according to health policy group KFF.",
      "\"That's a huge financial burden for most families,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at KFF, told CBS News. \"There's not a lot of people who can afford that.\"",
      "Some households could see even larger spikes. A family of four earning $75,000 per year is likely to see their insurance premiums rise by an additional $3,368 without the tax credits, the group estimated.",
      "Such a drastic increase in ACA costs would arrive as Americans are already struggling to afford groceries, rent, utilities and other essentials, leaving many financially pinched.",
      "\"Tsunami of health costs\"",
      "Some ACA participants told CBS News they are considering going without health insurance next year if their monthly premiums spike. Others are opting for cheaper plans with less coverage, potentially exposing them to higher costs and medical debt, Michelle Sternthal, director of government affairs at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "\"We are going to see a tsunami of health costs increasing\" on January 1, Sternthal said. \"Right now, we're hearing about families facing shocking increases.\"",
      "About 4 million people could drop their health insurance due to the higher ACA premiums, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The rising costs could hit some Americans harder than others, with small business owners and self-employed workers particularly vulnerable, Sternthal noted. Many such workers have turned to the ACA for health coverage because they lack employer-based insurance. About half of adults enrolled in the ACA are small business owners, employed by a company with fewer than 25 workers or are self-employed, according to KFF.",
      "That group includes Aaron Lehman, an Iowa farmer who grows corn, soybeans and other crops on his family's farm. In testimony before a Dec. 10 Senate hearing, he said the enhanced premium tax credits have allowed him to work full-time on his farm.",
      "\"But unfortunately, my wife and I have learned that in order to keep a similar policy for 2026, our health insurance costs will more than double,\" Lehman told the committee.",
      "Why the subsidies were created",
      "The ACA tax credits were established in 2021, as the U.S. was reeling from the pandemic, to lower households' monthly health plan costs; the subsidies were later extended under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act. With the credits set to expire this year, Democratic lawmakers this fall pushed for an extension, a congressional fight that became the main sticking point in the 43-day government shutdown that ended in November.",
      "As part of the deal to end the funding impasse, Republicans vowed to hold a vote on whether to extend the ACA credits by mid-December. The GOP also introduced its own measure to address health care costs, which involved sending funds directly to consumers rather than extending the ACA subsidies.",
      "However, votes on both health care proposals failed in the Senate on Thursday.\u00a0Some lawmakers\u00a0remain optimistic they can strike a bipartisan deal. But any agreement would likely involve reforms to the ACA to address income caps and fraud, along with a gradual phasing out of the enhanced subsidies.",
      "Sternthal of Community Catalyst thinks Congress will face political pressure to address the expired tax credits once once millions of families face sticker shock in January.",
      "In the meantime, Americans who get their health insurance through an employer-based plan could also be impacted by the higher ACA costs, she added.",
      "The reason:\u00a0 If millions drop coverage, as the CBO has predicted, it would likely destabilize the health care market because more people would need to rely on emergency rooms for treatment. Because hospitals, by law, must treat uninsured patients, they typically recoup the costs by hiking treatment costs for others.",
      "\"If you have fewer people covered, that means there will be more uncompensated care, and people will go to the ER \u2014 and that will trickle down into providers and insurance companies,\" Sternthal said. \"It's an economy-wide problem.\"",

    "summary": "A ruling striking down emergency levies could force the federal government to return most of the tariff revenue it has collected this year, according to Penn Wharton.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government could owe businesses as much as $168 billion if the Supreme Court rules that the Trump administration improperly invoked a federal emergency powers law earlier this year in hitting dozens of countries with new tariffs, according to a recent analysis.",
      "Through December 5, the U.S. government has collected $259 billion in tariff revenue, the nonpartisan research initiative found. But a ruling by the high court that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the country-specific tariffs could force the government to offer refunds to importers, said Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.",
      "In a November hearing on the case,\u00a0the Supreme Court seemed divided\u00a0over whether Mr. Trump had the legal authority to impose sweeping levies under IEEPA. Several justices appeared skeptical, noting that IEEPA does not mention the word \"tariff\" and that no president has ever relied on the act to justify broad-based tariffs on other nations.",
      "The Trump administration could likely maintain similar\u00a0tariff rates by drawing on other laws\u00a0if the IEEPA tariffs are struck down, although those statutes have more restrictions, according to legal experts.",
      "For example, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 also authorizes the president to apply country-based tariffs if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another nation is engaging in unfair trade practices.",
      "Despite the prospects of a large government refund for importers, Smetters thinks that striking down the tariffs would ultimately spur U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"Tariffs are one of the least efficient ways of raising revenue,\" he told CBS News, adding that tariffs make companies less productive because they have to pay more for imported parts and products.",
      "\"The government would have to come up with that money, so the federal debt would go up a little bit. But if these tariffs really were to go away, it would make U.S. companies more attractive to invest in,\" Smetters added.",
      "The Trump administration says tariffs are a key tool for energizing the U.S. manufacturing sector, boosting job growth, reducing the nation's trade deficit and generating federal revenue.",
      "\"The economic and national security consequences of the failure to uphold President Trump's lawful tariffs are enormous. The White House looks forward to the Supreme Court's speedy and proper resolution of this matter,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "Too little, too late?",
      "As of November 17, the overall effective tariff rate in the U.S. was 16.8%, the highest since 1935,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Yale Budget Lab. That compares with 2.4% in January before Mr. Trump returned to office.",
      "As a result, some small businesses say a tariff refund wouldn't offset the damage they say has been caused by sharply higher import duties.",
      "\"The money would go back to suppliers that incurred the tariffs. We are the end customer, and we continue to get the short end of the stick,\" Trinita Rhodes, the owner of Beauty Supply Refresh in Florissant, Missouri, said Wednesday in a media call hosted by Tariffs Cost US, an advocacy group that opposes Mr. Trump's levies.",
      "Rachel Lutz, owner of a women's clothing boutique, The Peacock Room, in Detroit, said a potential tariff refund would come too late.",
      "\"Small businesses don't have more than a 30-day cash reserve,\" he said in the Tariffs Cost US call. \"Reimbursement at this point doesn't make up for the disruption of staff cuts or hiring we could have made. The damage has already been done.\"",
      "Consumers are also feeling the impact of tariffs, research shows. Between February and November, U.S. households paid an average of $1,197.50 in tariffs, totaling nearly $160 billion, according to a\u00a0report this month from Democrats on the U.S. Congressional Joint Economic Committee.",
      "\"While President Trump promised that he would lower costs, this report shows that his tariffs have done nothing but drive prices even higher for families,\" Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat from New Hampshire and ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, said in a statement Thursday. \"At a time when both parties should be working together to lower costs, the President's tax on American families is simply making things more expensive.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 10:27:59 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply country-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",
      "The tariffs could be in effect \"within days if deemed necessary,\" Goldman Sachs said.",
      "Congressional action would be needed to extend the tariffs after 150 days.",
      "Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930",
      "Under Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930, the president can impose tariffs of up to 50% on imports from countries that discriminate against the U.S. The law defines discrimination as when a trading partner's laws, import duties, regulations or other restrictions place the U.S. at a disadvantage.",
      "These tariffs differ from Section 301 levies in that the tariff rate is capped at 50%. Additionally, no formal investigation is required. The authority has never been used, according to experts.",

    "summary": "President Trump has signed an executive order to block states from regulating artificial intelligence.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed an executive order Thursday aimed at restricting states from crafting their own regulations for artificial intelligence, saying the burgeoning industry is at risk of being stifled by a patchwork of onerous rules while in a battle with Chinese competitors for supremacy.",
      "Members of Congress from both parties, as well as civil liberties and consumer rights groups, have pushed for more regulations on AI, saying there is not enough oversight for the powerful technology.",
      "But Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office that \"there's only going to be one winner\" as nations race to dominate artificial intelligence, and China's central government gives its companies a single place to go for government approvals.",
      "\"We have the big investment coming, but if they had to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states, you can forget it because it's impossible to do,\" the president said.",
      "The executive order directs Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a new task force to challenge state laws, and directs the Department of Commerce to draw up a list of problematic regulations. It also threatens to restrict funding from a broadband deployment program and other grant programs to states with AI laws.",
      "David Sacks, a venture capitalist who is leading Mr. Trump's policies on cryptocurrency and artificial intelligence, said Thursday the Trump administration would only push back on \"the most onerous examples of state regulation\" but would not oppose \"kid safety\" measures.",
      "Four states \u2014 Colorado, California, Utah and Texas \u2014 have passed laws that set some rules for AI across the private sector, according to the International Association of Privacy Professionals.",
      "Those laws include limiting the collection of certain personal information and requiring more transparency from companies.",
      "The laws are in response to AI that already pervades everyday life. The technology helps make consequential decisions for Americans, including who gets a job interview, an apartment lease, a home loan and even certain medical care. But research has shown that it can make mistakes in those decisions, including by prioritizing a particular gender or race.",
      "States' more ambitious AI regulation proposals require private companies to provide transparency and assess the possible risks of discrimination from their AI programs.",
      "Beyond those more sweeping rules, many states have regulated parts of AI: barring the use of deepfakes in elections and to create nonconsensual porn, for example, or putting rules in place around the government's own use of AI.",
      "Those who support regulations that would prevent states from restricting AI\u00a0\u2014 including some GOP lawmakers and advocates like Sacks \u2014 argue that forcing tech companies to contend with varied or even contradictory rules would hurt the industry.",
      "\"At best, we'll end up with 50 different AI models for 50 different states \u2013 a regulatory morass worse than Europe,\" Sacks wrote on X\u00a0earlier this week. \"This will stymie innovation, especially by small startups who can't afford the compliance burden. Meanwhile, China will race ahead.\"",
      "But members of both parties have pushed back. Last month, when congressional Republicans weighed adding restrictions on state AI regulations to a defense bill, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called the idea a \"subsidy to Big Tech.\"",
      "\"The rise of AI is the most significant economic and cultural shift occurring at the moment; denying the people the ability to channel these technologies in a productive way via self-government constitutes federal government overreach and lets technology companies run wild,\" the governor wrote.",
      "Earlier this week, Democratic Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts called Mr. Trump's plan to restrict AI regulations via an executive order an \"early Christmas present for his CEO billionaire buddies.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 16:48:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration says it's also creating a $5 million platinum card visa that will allow foreigners to live in the U.S. for 270 days a year.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is touting his administration's new \"gold card\" visa as a fast track for foreigners who are willing and able to pay $1 million for the right to immigrate to the U.S.",
      "Applications for the new visa went live on Wednesday afternoon, with the government website for the gold card saying the process can be completed in a matter of weeks after applicants file their paperwork.",
      "Mr. Trump unveiled the gold card initiative in February, promoting it as an expedited path for wealthy foreigners to secure legal residency and as a way to generate government revenue. The term riffs on the \"green card,\" which grants permanent residency status to noncitizens so they can live and work in the U.S. indefinitely.",
      "\"All funds go to the United States government \u2014 it could be a tremendous amount of money,\" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday about the gold card. \"It's somewhat like a green card, but with big advantages over a green card.\"",
      "The program also includes a $2 million gold card for corporations that want to secure visas for workers, as well as a $5 million platinum card that allows foreigners to spend up to 270 days in the U.S. without being required to pay federal income tax on non-U.S. income.",
      "\"It's certainly plausible to me that this could be a meaningful source of revenue,\" John Lettieri, the CEO of the Economic Innovation Group, a bipartisan policy research group, told CBS News.",
      "But, he added, the gold card visa is likely to be a \"niche program,\" given the cost, although it could help attract some highly skilled foreign workers or entrepreneurs to the U.S.",
      "Here's how the gold card program will work.",
      "What is a Trump gold card?",
      "In essence, it's a green card that has been fast-tracked by the Trump administration.",
      "The website to apply for a gold card states that successful applicants will receive either an EB-1 or EB-2 visa, two kinds of employment-based green cards for skilled workers. To apply for an individual gold card, applicants must:",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "Pay a nonrefundable $15,000 processing fee to the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Undergo a vetting process, including a visa interview.",
      "Make a $1 million gift to the federal government after the vetting is complete.",
      "The new program also allows companies to obtain gold cards for employees, one per worker, with each requiring a $2 million donation, according to the website.",
      "Applicants must pay a $15,000 fee that will cover the cost of processing and conducting a background check, along with a 1% annual maintenance fee. Companies may also transfer the gold card between employees for a 5% transfer fee, the program specifies.",
      "A transfer could happen if a gold card holder becomes a U.S. citizen, for example.",
      "One potential difference between the Trump gold card and other types of green cards is that the new visa process could take only weeks, according to the Trump administration.",
      "By comparison, immigrants who apply for a regular green card can expect to wait between eight months and three years for approval, according to immigration services company Boundless. The quickest processing time is for spouses of U.S. citizens, who typically face an eight-month wait, the group said.",
      "How is the Trump gold card different from an EB-5 visa?",
      "The gold card is meant to replace EB-5 visas, which Congress created in 1990 to generate foreign investment. These have been available to people who spend at least $1 million to start a company with at least 10 workers.",
      "Unlike the EB-5 visa, however, a gold card visa doesn't require applicants to create a certain number of jobs or to invest in U.S. businesses.",
      "The EB-5 program has been criticized as cumbersome and as an invitation to commit fraud. In one notable case in recent years, hundreds of EB-5 applicants were defrauded by business executives in Vermont who claimed to be building a biotech facility, but who instead used the money for personal expenses.",
      "The process to obtain an EB-5 visa is also glacially slow, with a processing time of almost six years. That is \"by far the longest processing times in the U.S. immigration system,\" according to an April blog post about the Trump gold cards from EIG.",
      "The gold card is designed to help companies recruit foreign graduates of U.S. universities such as MIT and Harvard, Mr. Trump said on Wednesday.",
      "\"I've heard from Tim Cook of Apple, and I've heard from a lot of people, some of the people at this table, that essentially, in the United States, you can't keep the student,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Can gold card holders become citizens?",
      "Gold card recipients \"have a path to citizenship,\" U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said at the press conference on Wednesday with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Obviously, they have to be perfect people in America, and having passed the vetting, after five years they'll be available to become citizens,\" Lutnick said.",
      "Green card holders can typically apply for citizenship after residing in the U.S. for five years.",
      "Companies that secure a gold card for workers who then become citizens can transfer the card to new employees, Lutnick added.",
      "Can a gold card visa be revoked?",
      "Yes: The application website states: \"The Trump Gold Card is a visa; therefore, national security and significant criminal risks are a basis for revocation.\"",
      "How much money could the visa program raise for the U.S.?",
      "Mr. Trump didn't provide an estimate this week, but the program could generate billions in annual revenue, said Lettieri of the Economic Innovation Group.",
      "Based on the $1 million cost of a gold card visa, the program could raise $100 billion over a decade if it issues 10,000 gold cards per year, he calculated.",
      "\"Conservatively speaking, tens of billions over a decade is reasonable \u2014 it could be considerably higher,\" Lettieri said.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Dec 2025 11:55:05 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump says he's winning the war against inflation. But a look at prices around the U.S. shows why many Americans still feel financially squeezed.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump delivered a message Tuesday evening aimed at the millions of Americans struggling to afford daily necessities, saying his administration is \"crushing\" inflation and that \"prices are coming down tremendously.\" Economic data tells a different story.",
      "Prices have edged higher for much of Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, with inflation in September rising at an annual rate of 3% (the most recent available inflation data because of the recent U.S. government shutdown).",
      "Inflation dipped to a low this year of 2.3% in April, but it has steadily ticked up since then and now stands at the same rate as in January, when Mr. Trump was inaugurated, federal data shows. Economists attribute the rise partly to the Trump administration's new tariffs on imports, with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pointing to those levies as a key factor behind the recent uptick.",
      "Inflation now \"is higher than earlier in the year as inflation for goods has picked up, reflecting the impact of tariffs,\" Powell said at a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the central bank's latest interest rate cut.",
      "Some Wall Street analysts think prices are likely to continue creeping up for a while. Mark Vickery, senior market analyst at Zacks Investment Research, estimates that the Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of around 3.3% in November.",
      "To be sure, many economists, as well as the Fed, expect any additional pickup in inflation to be short-lived before easing in 2026. Powell on Wednesday said the tariff effect will likely create a one-time rise in prices that should fade over the coming year. The Fed expects inflation to recede to 2.4% next year, down from about 2.9% in 2025.",
      "From a longer-term perspective, inflation has indeed fallen sharply since hitting a 40-year high of about 9% in June 2022 in the aftermath of the pandemic. For shoppers, however, a lower inflation rate doesn't mean prices are declining \u2014 only that they're rising at a slower pace.",
      "Consumers tend not to view pocketbook issues through the lens of official inflation measures, a somewhat abstract metric that tracks price fluctuations over time, experts have long noted. Instead, many shoppers focus on their actual dollars-and-cents spending, including whether their out-of-pocket expenses are higher than they were in the past, according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "By that yardstick, Americans are spending more on everyday basics than they were a year ago, and far more than they did just before the pandemic, CPI data shows.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks, made Tuesday in Mount Pocono, Pa., came as his administration touts the president's economic policies ahead of next year's midterm elections.",
      "\"I have no higher priority than making America affordable,\" Mr. Trump said in the speech.",
      "Prior to the speech, Mr. Trump had decried affordability as a \"hoax\" perpetuated by Democrats, although some Republicans, including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, have differed with him on the issue. Greene told CBS News that she doesn't believe affordability is a hoax, adding, \"Everyone's bills have either stayed the same or gone up.\"",
      "\"You can't gaslight people and tell them that their bills are affordable,\" Greene said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai expressed confidence that Mr. Trump's agenda will cool inflation and boost worker wages.",
      "\"President Trump inherited the worst inflation crisis in a generation from Joe Biden's incompetence, and his Administration has rapidly cooled inflation to a 2.5% annualized rate,\" Desai said in a statement to CBS News. \"As the administration's supply-side policies of tax cuts, deregulation and energy abundance continue taking effect, Americans can count on inflation continuing to fall and real wages continuing to rise.\"",
      "Food",
      "Americans paid 2.7% more for food bought at the grocery store in September than they did a year earlier, according to the most recent CPI figures. That may not seem like much, but their grocery bills have climbed roughly 49% since 2020.",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "See the CBS News price tracker showing changes in the price of food, gas, utilities and other costs",
      "Some food costs are also rising much faster than the rate of inflation, with beef steaks surging almost 17% from a year ago, according to the CPI data. Earlier this month, the Trump administration sought to lower some grocery prices by exempting foods like beef, coffee and bananas from new country-specific tariffs.",
      "Shoppers on Tuesday told CBS News' Nancy Cordes that they are making tradeoffs and scrimping to afford groceries.",
      "\"The cost of beef is astronomical. I will mainly get what's on sale,\" Anne Marie Hadley, a retired special education teacher who was shopping Tuesday at Schiel's Family Market, a family-owned grocery store in Scranton, Pa., told Cordes.",
      "Housing",
      "While mortgage rates have dropped this year, housing remains out of reach for most would-be buyers. More than 75% of homes across the country are unaffordable for the typical household, Bankrate said in a report this week.",
      "A homebuyer today needs to earn $131,400 a year to afford a typical home in the U.S. \u2014 almost double the roughly $65,000 needed five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "Gas",
      "One area where consumers are getting a break is at the pump, with gasoline prices down from a year earlier. Gas declined 0.5% in September from a year earlier, CPI data shows. And earlier this month, gas dropped below $3 a gallon on average, marking the lowest price since May 2021.",
      "\"It was just reported that four states had $1.99 a gallon,\" Mr. Trump said on Tuesday. \"We are right now involved in more energy, and have more energy in the works by far than we've ever had before.\"",
      "The decline is due to strong refinery output and lower crude oil prices, as well as to softer seasonal fuel demand, GasBuddy has said.",
      "Yet while fuel prices have dropped, other energy costs have increased. Residential electricity prices around the U.S. rose more than 10% over the first eight months of 2025, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an educational and policy organization. By comparison, power costs rose roughly 6% over the trailing 12 months.",
      "As of June, nearly one in 20 U.S. households was seriously behind on their utility bills, according to a report from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. Over the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the groups found.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 15:06:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair and her allegations of abuse, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles after she was quoted offering blunt assessments of his inner circle in Vanity Fair.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

Vice President JD Vance was also in Pennsylvania on Tuesday to promote the administration's agenda.",

Mr. Trump was in Florida at the time.",

      "\"Yesterday, after he made a stop at Target, he did get pulled over by [U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, and once he was able to produce his passport ID, they did let him go,\" Omar said in an interview with Esme Murphy on WCCO Sunday Morning.",
      "The congresswoman said her son \"always carries\" his passport with him.",
      "Omar said ICE also previously entered a mosque where her son and others were praying, but left without incident. After that, she said she \"had to remind him just how worried I am, because all of these areas that they are talking about are areas where he could possibly find himself in and they are racially profiling, they are looking for young men who look Somali that they think are undocumented.\"",
      "ICE's Acting Director Todd Lyons said the agency has \"absolutely zero record of its officers or agents pulling over Congresswoman Omar's son\" and accused her of trying to \"unfairly demonize our law enforcement officers.\"",
      "Lyons also said Omar's allegations of racial profiling are \"disgusting, reckless and categorically false.\"",

It's no surprise that an agency known for disappearing people also can't keep its records straight,\" the spokesperson said. \"ICE now claims it has records of all the stops, and our office would welcome the opportunity to review them.\"",
      "Earlier this month, federal agents surged into the Twin Cities with the stated goal of targeting undocumented Somali immigrants. The enhanced focus on the Somali community came after President Trump said he doesn't \"want them in our country\" and called Omar herself \"garbage.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Federal law enforcement officials said Monday that four members of a far-left anti-government group have been arrested and face charges for allegedly planning a series of bomb attacks across Southern California on New Year's Eve.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel said that the four people who face charges for the alleged plot in California are members of a group known as the Turtle Island Liberation Front. Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "A fifth person, Micah James Legnon, was arrested in Louisiana and charged with one count of making threats in interstate commerce. A FBI agent said in an\u00a0affidavit that Legnon appears to be a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and \"intended to travel to New Orleans to carry out an attack by means of weapons.\" Legnon, who served in the U.S. Marines, was stopped by law enforcement on a highway in Louisiana on Friday and had an assault rifle, pistol, gas canister, and body armor in his car, according to court papers.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",
      "An Instagram account for the group's Los Angeles chapter\u00a0says it advocates for \"liberation through decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\" The group does not appear to be particularly well-known: its Instagram account had fewer than 900 followers as of Monday morning, and its Facebook page was followed by just 32 users.",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted far-left groups and movements as leading domestic terrorism threats. In September, the president signed a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0calling for the creation of a \"national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence,\" as well as investigations into organizations that he believes engage in political violence. He claimed that violent conduct is animated by \"anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity\" views.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" even though antifa is a political movement with no official leadership or organization structure.",
      "Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches high-risk activism and political violence, said the Turtle Island Liberation Front appears to be part of the larger ecosystem of groups that the Trump administration is focusing on, with a far-left, anarchist, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist ideology.",
      "\"The individuals that were involved in this alleged plot appear to be a splinter group or an offshoot of the larger Turtle Island Liberation Front,\" he said. \"In other words, I believe that there are members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front that had nothing to do with this plot, and what we appear to be seeing is several individuals that have decided to escalate their activism to actual political violence.\"",
      "Kenney said the group appears to be small, but active in terms of digital and offline activism.",
      "\"This is a group that has an ideology, they have a set of political ideas that they follow, that they are trying to implement,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do here is bring attention to those ideas and their beliefs.\"",
      "Federal officials said one of the defendants, Carroll, 30, created a \"detailed bombing plot\" in November and provided it to a FBI source. She allegedly worked with Page, 32, to obtain and build the bombs, and to recruit participants for the plan. Essayli said Carroll's \"bomb plot was explicit,\" and included instructions for building the devices and targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.",
      "\"These bombs were to blow up at the same time, on midnight this New Year's Eve,\" said Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. \"The plan stated that the IEDs would be complex pipe bombs. It included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and contained guidance on how to avoid leaving evidence behind that can be traced back to them.\"",

      "The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida, includes one count of defamation and one count of violating a Florida trade practices law. Mr. Trump's legal team asked for $5 billion in damages for each count, for a total of $10 billion.",
      "In a 33-page complaint, attorneys for Mr. Trump accused the BBC of publishing a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in a BBC \"Panorama\" documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election. One portion of the documentary focused on Mr. Trump's words and actions leading up to the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The lawsuit claims that the BBC \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips of the same speech that Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington, D.C., before the riots began.",
      "Mr. Trump's legal team claims that the two clips were 55 minutes apart, and the BBC's edit omitted \"his statement calling for peace\" in his speech. The president had directed his supporters to go to Capitol Hill, where lawmakers were soon to vote to confirm election results in favor of former President Joe Biden.",

Mr. Trump's critics have long argued that his words on Jan. 6 \u2014 and his false claims of widespread fraud in the 2020 election \u2014 fueled the riot. The president has defended his conduct, saying he used only \"beautiful words\" on Jan. 6, but the BBC used \"terrible words.\"",
      "\"I'm suing the BBC for putting words in my mouth, literally,\" the president said Monday. \"They put words in my mouth. They had me saying things that I never said, coming out. I guess they used AI or something.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the BBC unless it retracted the documentary and offered financial compensation.",
      "In November, the BBC apologized to Mr. Trump for the episode, but declined to compensate him for it. In a statement at the time, the BBC said it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim. BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness resigned amid the editing controversy.",
      "A lawyer for the BBC wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump's legal team that the broadcaster had \"no intention of misleading anyone. He argued the president can't show that the BBC acted with \"actual malice,\" meaning it intentionally or recklessly published false information \u2014 a prerequisite for most defamation suits against public figures in the U.S.",
      "The attorney also argued the president cannot sue the BBC in Florida because the documentary was not aired in the U.S. or made available on the BBC's website for American viewers.",
      "Despite the apology, the president's legal filing says, the network has \"made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" Mr. Trump's lawyers also argued that the BBC can be sued in Florida because the \"Panorama\" documentary was available to U.S. viewers on its BritBox streaming service.",
      "Last month, U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News that Mr. Trump was \"clearly owed a fulsome apology,\" but any lawsuit would face \"a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown on television in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true. And they can point to all sorts of previous judicial findings which have said that there was some measure of incitement in which the president was involved.\"",

    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin wants to see White House construction like President Trump's ballroom project subjected to the same scrutiny as other federal projects.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland plans to introduce legislation Tuesday that would subject White House renovations like President Trump's ballroom project to the same reviews as other federal projects. Currently, the White House is exempt from certain oversight under the National Historic Preservation Act.",
      "Raskin's bill, called the \"People's White House Historic Preservation Act,\" would require White House renovations to undergo a so-called \"Section 106 review,\" a pre-ground breaking assessment that addresses the impact of renovations on historic buildings and allows the public to weigh in.",
      "The legislation comes three months after construction crews began work on a privately-financed, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition that will cost about $300 million. A construction crane hangs over the site where the East Wing once stood. It was demolished in late October, even though President Trump had previously said the new construction would be \"near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has reveled in how easy it's been to fast track the project. In October, Mr. Trump recounted being told, \"Sir, this is the White House, you're the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.\"",
      "\"It's kings who treat public property as private property,\" Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CBS News in a phone interview. \"It's not his house; it's our house. And if there is going to be construction and renovation expansion or changes, that should go through a regular public process.\"",
      "The White House asserts Mr. Trump has \"full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House.\"",
      "Aside from renderings Mr. Trump has shown at various events, ballroom schematics have faced little formal scrutiny \u2014 but that may soon change.",
      "In a court filing late Monday, the administration said consultations \"will soon be underway\" with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, two independent advisory boards overseeing federal projects in the Washington area. The administration added that it was not legally bound to confer with either board and that above-ground ballroom construction would begin in April at the earliest.",
      "Raskin's bill would mandate consultations with both commissions prior to ground breaking.",
      "At its monthly meeting in early December, NCPC chairman Will Scharf, who is also a White House staffer, said the White House was not required to submit demolition plans because the commission only oversees new construction.",
      "\"We simply do not have jurisdiction over demolition and site preparation work; that what we're really concerned about here is visible architecture \u2014 is above-ground build,\" Scharf said, adding that NCPC would play a \"constructive role\" when the time comes.",
      "Raskin argues that leveling the East Wing without a review process was a violation of destruction of federal property laws, though he acknowledges the president cannot be prosecuted under those statutes.",
      "Currently, Raskin's legislation has 27 Democratic co-sponsors. With Republicans in control of the House, the measure faces long odds.",
      "\"I hope that there are enough champions of the public-private distinction in the Republican caucus that we can bring some over,\" Raskin said.",
      "Last week, National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit seeking to halt ballroom construction. \"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, not anyone else,\" the Trust's suit said. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "In response, the administration said the Trust's complaint was moot \"because the demolition has already occurred and cannot be undone.\"",
      "An initial hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Washington.",
      "Jennifer  Jacobs and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "The U.S. military says it struck three more alleged drug-carrying boats in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, the latest in a campaign of vessel strikes ordered by the Trump administration that have killed at least 95 people in 25 boats.",
      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",
      "Southern Command also posted a 47-second video that appeared to show three separate strikes on vessels.",
      "On Dec. 15, at the direction of @SecWar Pete Hegseth, Joint Task Force Southern Spear conducted lethal kinetic strikes on three vessels operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters. Intelligence confirmed that the vessels were transiting along known\u2026 pic.twitter.com/IQfCVvUpau",
      "The U.S. military began striking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean in early September, part of what the Trump administration has described as a \"non-international armed conflict\" against drug cartels that it has designated as terror groups.",
      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

    "summary": "President Trump's White House ballroom addition is expected to be finished a few months before the 2028 elections.",
    "story": [
      "Construction of the White House's planned $300 million ballroom is expected to be completed in the summer of 2028, just months before President Trump leaves office, according to an environmental assessment prepared by the National Park Service in late August.",
      "The assessment finds some shortcomings in the presidential project, mostly stemming from the sheer size of the new structure. The 90,000 square-foot building \u2014 nearly double the size of the existing executive mansion \u2014 will \"disrupt the historical continuity of the White House grounds and alter the architectural integrity of the east side of the property,\" it found.",
      "\"The new building's larger footprint and height will dominate the eastern portion of the site, creating a visual imbalance with the more modestly scaled West Wing and Executive Mansion,\" the report continues. \"These changes will adversely alter the design, setting, and feeling of the White House and the grounds over the long-term.\"",
      "However, it goes on to conclude that the space will be beneficial for large gatherings, perpetual changes and adaptations are part of the White House's history, and the ballroom annex \"will not result in a significant adverse impact to historic buildings.\"",
      "The report was prepared by NPS Deputy Director Frank Land and approved by Jessica Bowron, the service's acting director.",
      "When the ballroom project was announced on July 31, President Trump said the ballroom addition \"won't interfere with the current building. \u2026 It will be near it but not touching it.\"",
      "But less than a month later, the plan changed. The Aug. 28 document concluded, \"The existing East Wing and East Colonnade will be deconstructed.\" The East Wing was ultimately torn down in late October.",
      "Prior to demolition, the Park Service said all museum collections, artifacts, and paintings would be removed from the East Wing and preserved. Steps were also taken to potentially reinstall wood paneling, light fixtures, interior columns and items from the East Wing movie theater.",
      "Preservationists also saved the commemorative cornerstone and the bronze plaque from the East Wing's 1942 renovation, two fanlight windows and the Kennedy Garden arbor.",
      "The environmental assessment contains design details of the new ballroom, which will be attached to the executive mansion via a bi-level corridor.",
      "\"Materials will include a white painted exterior, historically compatible windows and doors, and an architecturally compatible roof,\" it says. \"Interior finishes will include stone slab flooring, decorative plaster moldings, and high-quality finishes for elevator cabs.\"",
      "The East Wing has long served as the visitors' entrance for formal White House events and tours \u2014 and it will continue to do so. In addition, \"Ground-floor restrooms will support events on the South Lawn,\" the document said.",
      "The NPS environmental assessment emerged from a lawsuit filed by the Trust for Historic Preservation that seeks to halt ballroom construction. The suit alleged that the Trump administration skirted federal law by tearing down the East Wing and drawing up plans for a massive new ballroom without going through a review process. The government has argued that the president has extensive power to make changes to the White House.",
      "Overall, the NPS assessment found that the project will cause \"no significant impact.\"",
      "But that does not mean no impact at all.",
      "Trees and shrubs, including commemorative Southern Magnolias planted in the 1940s, will be removed from the lawn due to the size of the 90,000-square-foot addition.",
      "President Trump has complained about temporary tents brought in for large events like state dinners. While the ballroom will eliminate the needs for those structures, NPS assesses that \"views of the White House from Lafayette Park and the Ellipse will be permanently altered due to the modifications to the East Wing.",
      "One view won't be changed: the vista from the White House to the Washington Monument and Jefferson Memorial.",
      "In reaching its \"no significant impact\" finding, the National Park Service's analysis examined various facets of the project \u2014 cultural landscape, historic buildings, visitor access and experience, public health and safety, economic impact and quality of life of the American people.",
      "The East Garden will be removed and reinstalled. Bricks, a fountain and a statue will be \"carefully dismantled and preserved for future reinstallation,\" it said.",
      "The assessment anticipated that grass would need to be replaced and roads repaved because of damage from heavy construction equipment.",
      "It also warned that construction vibrations \"could affect the structural stability or finishes of the Executive Mansion and adjacent features.\"",
      "The NPS said it would document the now-demolished East Wing's interior and exterior with a 3-D survey and high resolution photographs.",
      "The park service also considered the impact on endangered species native to the region including the northern long-eared bat, tricolored bat and monarch butterfly. Ultimately it found \"no meaningful, measurable or noticeable impact\" on the animals.",

      "\"The short-term strategy is, win the House of Representatives,\" stated the former president, garnering applause. \"Because that's going to be the circuit breaker that will give us control of one major component of the federal government. With that as a bulwark, we're now able to block some of the worst impulses that are coming out of this White House.\"",
      "The former president laid out a two-pronged strategy for Democrats: to reclaim a House majority next year, and to work on honing the party's messaging in the coming years.",
      "\"Long term, let's tell a story, a better story about who we are as Americans and what we share,\" Obama said, according to excerpts shared with CBS News. \"We have to tell the story that makes people who feel outside that process, we've got to bring them back in.\"",
      "He also encouraged Democrats to remain unified.",
      "\"The truth is that AOC and Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders and Blue Dog, they actually agree in making sure that people have a living wage, they can support a family,\" Obama said, arguing that most Americans aren't focused on the party's \"nerdy,\" \"college seminar\"-style internal debates. \"Of course there are going to be some tactical differences, but that shouldn't be our primary concern because we're fighting a bigger fight.\"",
      "The conversation with Leader Jeffries, who he alluded to as the \"soon-to-be Speaker,\" was part of an event held by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), the fundraising arm for House Democrats.",
      "\"The most important thing that we need to do is to win back control of the House of Representatives, as President Obama indicated, as part of the path to ending this national nightmare in the United States of America and moving toward a more perfect union,\" Jeffries told CBS News.",
      "Their discussion on Sunday\u00a0also touched on redistricting efforts across the country as well as how to address the affordability crisis.",
      "\"If we bring energy and clarity and commitment to talking about things like affordability and making sure people have health care when they need it, and that they have the ability, if they work hard, to be able to support a family and create a better future for their children and their grandchildren, \u2026 it resonates with people, and we have to have confidence in that,\" Obama said.",
      "Most Democrats are keen to focus on economic frustrations in the midterms. A late November CBS News poll found public sentiment about the economy hit its lowest level this year with only 32% of respondents describing it as \"good.\" Nearly two-thirds said prices are going up, while 77% said President Trump is not spending enough time on the economy and inflation.",
      "Mr. Trump traveled to Pennsylvania last week to tout his economic agenda and promote a GOP tax cut bill passed earlier this year. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal on Friday, the president wouldn't say if his policies would boost congressional Republicans' prospects at the ballot box next fall.",
      "\"I can't tell you. I don't know when all of this money is going to kick in,\" he told the paper.",

      "Obama described Mr. Trump's ascendance as a \"wake-up call,\" but said he was \"not entirely surprised\" by recent off-year Democratic wins.",
      "The former president campaigned this fall for gubernatorial candidates Mikie Sherill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who both won their races in November by double-digit margins. Obama pointed to Democrats' newfound optimism since those victories, noting that he spent much of his time after Mr. Trump's return to office \"talking people off of ledges.\"",

    "summary": "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on sedition charges, his daughter told reporters she hopes international pressure can spare her father.",
    "story": [
      "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a businessman and pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on national security and sedition charges, his daughter Claire Lai told reporters in Washington, D.C., she hopes international pressure can spare her father from spending the rest of his life in prison.",
      "\"We expected the verdict,\" she told CBS News. \"As much as you can expect that, you can only be so ready for it. So I am grieving.\"",
      "Lai, 78, was found guilty on three charges: one sedition charge and two charges of violating the National Security Law, a controversial Hong Kong law instituted in 2020 following pro-democracy protests in 2019. The charges were conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was often sharply critical of the Chinese government and its growing influence over the city. The paper closed in 2021 after police raided the newsroom, arrested reporters and froze the publication's assets. Jimmy Lai was arrested in 2020 and held in custody since.",
      "Jonathan Price, part of Jimmy Lai's international legal team, said the results of the trial were unsurprising, but argued they reflect China's reneging of commitments to the rule of law in Hong Kong and agreements made between the British and Chinese governments when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The government in Beijing had agreed to grant Hong Kong autonomy until at least 2047, but it has increasingly exerted control over the enclave.",
      "\"It's 855 pages of obfuscation, fluff, diversion with some colorful language, but no substance,\" he told CBS News. \"It's extraordinary that a document of that length involving a case about someone who ran a press organization doesn't mention substantively, press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or any human rights.\"",
      "Claire Lai last spoke to her father in June of this year, and said his condition has noticeably deteriorated. She described that his nails are changing colors and falling off and his teeth are rotting. She also worries about his diabetes and heart palpitations. She blames his prison conditions and solitary confinement for his deterioration.",
      "Claire Lai, her family and her legal team fear that appeals could take over 8 years and fear Jimmy Lai may not live long enough to endure the process.",
      "\"My father does not have eight years. If we wait to the end of the appeals process, there will not be a man at the end of that process,\" she told CBS News.",
      "On Monday, President Trump and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper both called for the release of Jimmy Lai.",
      "In the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said, \"I feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release. He's not well. He's an older man, and he's not well. So I did put that request out, we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Cooper emphasized that Jimmy Lai is a British citizen and told Parliament that she had summoned the Chinese Ambassador after hearing the verdict.",
      "\"But for the sake of Jimmy Lai, for his family, but also for the people of Hong Kong, for the joint Declaration we signed, and for the rule of law, we will not relent on this,\" she said. \"Joined by nations across the world, we call again for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai.\"",
      "Earlier in the year, Claire Lai met with members of Congress on Capitol Hill, culminating in a bipartisan letter asking for her father's release.",
      "As the holidays near, Claire Lai remembers the few times she saw her father a year since 2020, on their birthdays and Christmas. She said she hopes she can see her father again someday, without their conversations recorded and without armed prison guards standing by.",
      "\"One of the many things I've learned from my father is that you have to face adversity and difficulties with a certain degree of cheer and spirit,\" she told CBS News. \"My father has shown that not even his failing health can alleviate him of the burden of truth, and that's why he chose to take the stand for so many days.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide. The president's comments were quickly condemned by a number of lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is now being held without bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on X.",
      "A reporter asked the president later Monday if he stands by his post. Mr. Trump did not apologize.",
      "\"Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all,\" the president said. \"He was a deranged person, as fall as Trump was concerned,\" he said, saying Reiner was \"one of the people behind\" the \"Russia hoax.\" \"I think he hurt himself career-wise. Became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.\"",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters that Mr. Trump \"should've said nothing.\"",
      "\"I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements and his agenda,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He continued: \"And just speaking personally, when someone is murdered or assassinated, as happened to Mr. Kirk, we should show him and his family respect,\" referring to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners' killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday signed an executive order designating illicit fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction, directing the Pentagon and Justice Department to take additional steps to combat production and distribution of the drug and its precursors.",
      "The executive order casts fentanyl as not just a lethal drug, but as a potential chemical weapon. The White House says the move \"unleashes every tool to combat the cartels and foreign networks responsible for flooding communities with this deadly substance,\" warning that fentanyl could be weaponized for \"concentrated, large-scale terror attacks by organized adversaries.\"",
      "The designation means the Pentagon could aid the Justice Department with Department of Defense assets to enforce the criminal code related to fentanyl, and the Justice Department will likely pursue harsher penalties for fentanyl-related crimes.",
      "The order comes as the president has said he is preparing to expand the U.S. campaign against alleged drug traffickers in South America, following more than 20 boat strikes against vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. Most of the fentanyl that enters the U.S. is manufactured in Mexico using chemicals primarily imported from China and India. The drug is then smuggled into the U.S., mostly through ports of entry.",
      "\"With this historic executive order ... we're formally classifying as a weapon of mass destruction, which is what it is,\" the president said at the White House. \"No bomb does what this has done. 200,000 to 300,000 people die every year, that we know of. So we're formally classifying fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction.\"",
      "Fentanyl overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18 to 45. The Drug Enforcement Administration says more than 107,000 people died from a drug overdose in the U.S. in 2023, and nearly 70% of those deaths were attributed to opioids like fentanyl.",
      "The president's executive order describes illicit fentanyl as fentanyl that is manufactured, distributed, dispensed or possessed in violation of the Controlled Substances Act. It makes no mention of fentanyl used legally in medical settings.",
      "The FBI defines a WMD as a \"destructive device, such as an explosive or incendiary bomb, rocket, or grenade; a weapon that is designed to cause death or serious injury through toxic or poisonous chemical; a weapon that contains a biological agent or toxin;\" or \"a weapon that is designed to release dangerous levels of radiation or radioactivity.\"",

    "summary": "See maps of how Texas, California, Missouri and North Carolina redistricting pushes could play out, based on the 2024 election results.",
    "story": [
      "Several states undertook mid-decade redistricting efforts to try to alter the makeup of their congressional delegations this year, after President Trump began last summer to press Republican-led states to increase the number of GOP-friendly districts to help his party hold the House in next year's midterm elections.",
      "Indiana became the first of these to reject a new map proposed by GOP legislators to redraw the state's congressional districts so that all nine congressional districts would be favorable to Republicans.",
      "Texas was the first to kick off the gerrymandering push, when\u00a0Gov. Greg Abbott signed legislation in August to redraw the districts and create five GOP-friendly seats. In California,\u00a0Gov. Gavin Newsom,\u00a0in turn, launched an effort to redraw his state's map to help Democrats. In November, the plan was approved by voters by a 29-point margin.",
      "In Missouri, state lawmakers redrew their map in September to squeeze Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver from his Kansas City district. Then in October, North Carolina state Republicans\u00a0redrew the 1st Congressional District, held by a Democrat, to make it more favorable to conservatives.",
      "But Republicans in Indiana's state Senate rejected the redistricting measure in a 31-19 vote on Dec. 11, despite the GOP's 40-10 advantage in the chamber. Ahead of the vote, as the lawmakers faced intense pressure from Mr. Trump and other members of his administration, Indiana state police said they had received \"numerous\" bomb threats and swatting hoaxes against state senators.",
      "Utah lawmakers also reworked their state's map after a judge ruled the current districts violated restrictions on gerrymandering. All four of the state's House districts are represented by Republicans, but a judge in November threw out the GOP-controlled legislature's map and ordered one that will create a Democratic-leaning district in Salt Lake City.",
      "Congressional maps are normally redrawn every 10 years after the U.S. Census reveals population shifts. But this rare mid-decade redistricting push was kicked off as Republicans seek to maintain \u2014 or even expand \u2014 their razor-thin majority in Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Historically speaking, midterms are often a rebuke of the party in the White House.",
      "Although both parties are trying to rig their states' congressional districts to be favorable to themselves, the outcome is far from guaranteed.",
      "\"Computers and technology do give us a lot more ability to to make predictive statements about outcomes, but we're doing it \u2014 I think it's fair to say \u2014 in a very volatile environment politically, where things that we have seen as trends are sort of being turned on their heads,\" said Kareem Crayton, vice president of the Washington, D.C.-based the Brennan Center for Justice.",
      "Crayton noted several current issues that could factor heavily into voters' decisions, and called it \"folly to assume that just because people showed up and voted for the current president of the United States, that people want to show up for a member of Congress, particularly \u2026 a new candidate in a district that hasn't been created before.\"",
      "See how maps passed in Texas, California, North Carolina and Missouri could change their congressional makeup",
      "Texas has 38 congressional seats, with 25 held by Republicans and 13 by Democrats.",
      "Republicans have invested heavily in the Rio Grande Valley, once a Democratic stronghold, but they've made inroads. In 2024, two of the three Rio Grande Valley House seats voted for Mr. Trump, though they reelected their Democratic congressional representatives. The maps were designed to increase those gains and box out the two Democrats.",
      "Texas Democrats have recently made gains in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Houston's Harris County. The new maps reshape Democratic Rep. Al Green's Houston district in the rural areas, making a district that was 72% Democratic into one that is 40% Democratic. The proposed map also changes Rep. Julie Johnson's Dallas-area district from 62% to 41% Democratic. Rep. Marc Veasey's district in Dallas-Fort Worth remains a Democratic stronghold, but he would no longer live in the district.",
      "Liberal Austin is further dissolved into neighboring districts. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who was first elected in 1994 and whose district gave former Vice President Kamala Harris her largest margin of victory in all of Texas, announced in August that he would not seek reelection if the proposed maps are upheld by the courts, avoiding a primary with Rep. Greg Casar, also of Austin.",
      "On Nov. 18, a three-judge panel in the U.S. District Court in El Paso blocked Texas from using the maps approved by the legislature in August. The court said that the plaintiffs will likely succeed in showing that race predominated over partisanship in the map-making process, and said the legislature appears to have set and followed a racial target.",
      "Abbott appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately restored the map passed this summer.",
      "California has 52 House representatives, with nine Republicans and 43 Democrats.",
      "In 2020, Republicans flipped three seats held by Democrats for the first time since 1994. They've hung onto two of them, including GOP Rep. David Valadao's 22nd District in the Central Valley.",
      "Under the proposed map, Valadao's district would go from being 47% Democratic in 2024 to 49% Democratic, making him slightly more vulnerable. And GOP Rep. Darrell Issa's 48th District near San Diego would change from 42% to 52% Democratic.",
      "In Southern California, Rep. Ken Calvert's 41st District in Riverside would be redrawn further toward Los Angeles, shifting it from a district that was 47% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 57% Democratic under the proposed maps.",
      "In Northern California, GOP Rep. Doug LaMalfa's District 1, which includes the northeastern-most part of the state, would shift further south toward Marin County and the northern part would be absorbed in the 2nd District, home to heavily Democratic Eureka and the northern Pacific coast. Rep. Kevin Kiley's district, which snakes along the California-Nevada border through Death Valley, would instead move further toward heavily Democratic Sacramento. Republican Rep. Tom McClintock's 5th District would be shifted to include the southern portions of what was Kiley's district.",
      "Kiley, whose district would go from one that was 48% Democratic in 2024 to one that is 55% Democratic, has been an outspoken critic of redistricting, even introducing legislation in the House to ban mid-decade redistricting.",
      "After Texas and California's redistricting efforts, Gov. Kehoe called a special session of Missouri's legislature to take up redistricting. Missouri currently has two Democratic representatives in Congress: Rep. Wesley Bell, who represents St. Louis and was first elected in 2025, and Cleaver, who has represented the Kansas City area since 2005.",
      "As Missouri has trended toward Republicans over the past 20 years, Cleaver's district has been a target of the GOP, especially in the 2021 redistricting when several lawmakers pushed for what was called the \"7 to 1 map\" that would have redrawn the 5th Congressional District to be more Republican. Lawmakers ultimately decided against that plan. St. Louis' NPR station reported that Republicans worried that the short-term gains from carving up the district could lead to long-term problems in the neighboring suburban districts.",
      "Nonetheless, the Missouri GOP joined the redistricting effort in 2025. Under the new map, Cleaver's district transforms from one that is 62% Democratic to one that is 41% Democratic. Cleaver says he still plans to run for reelection.",
      "The neighboring 4th and 6th Districts both become slightly bluer, to 39% and 36% Democratic, respectively, but they are still safely Republican.",
      "By expanding the 2nd District south and west, GOP Rep. Ann Wagner's district becomes redder, going from 46% Democratic in 2024 to 44%. While Wagner has maintained her grip on the district, Mr. Trump won by only 100 votes under the previous lines in 2020. In the 2021 redistricting, Wagner's district lost some of the Democratic-leaning St. Louis County.",
      "Opponents of the map submitted in early December more than 300,000 signatures on a petition to force a ballot measure on the new map. A judge is currently reviewing if the signatures are valid.",
      "North Carolina has 14 congressional seats, 10 of which are held by Republicans. But the state is not as solidly red as that breakdown would suggest \u2014 it's closer to a 50/50 state at the presidential level these days, and the state's governor and attorney general are both Democrats.",
      "In the redistricting push undertaken this fall, North Carolina Republicans are targeting a single seat: Rep. Don Davis' 1st Congressional District. Davis' win in 2024 in the northeastern part of the state was a rare bright spot for Democrats, especially after Republicans were able to flip congressional three seats in North Carolina that year.",
      "In the map passed by the North Carolina Assembly on Oct. 21 and 22, Davis' district boundaries move further south, into the current 3rd District. That changes the makeup of the district from one that was 48% Democratic to one that is 44% Democratic.",
      "See how maps of how court-ordered redistricting could change Utah's congressional makeup",
      "Utah differs from the other states here, among other reasons, because there are no Democrats among the four members of its congressional delegation. And its 2025 redistricting effort was put in motion when a judge ruled the current districts violated a voter-approved measure to prevent partisan gerrymandering.",
      "The GOP-controlled legislature produced four maps for public comment, and on Oct. 6, approved a map that would be the least competitive for Democrats. The legislature proposed a map that would split Salt Lake County into two districts, which would make Districts 2 and 3 more competitive for Democrats.",
      "But a district court judge in Utah on Nov. 10 rejected redistricting maps selected by the Republican-controlled legislature and instead selected a map that would create a Democratic-leaning congressional district in Salt Lake City. The map approved by the legislature \"does not comply with Utah law,\" wrote 3rd District Court Judge Dianna Gibson in her opinion. She continued that \"based on the evidence presented,\" the legislature's map \"unduly favors Republicans and disfavors Democrats.\"",
      "The maps enacted by Gibson create a new district encompassing Salt Lake City that would be 62% Democratic, based on the 2024 presidential results.",
      "See maps of how Indiana's failed redistricting would have changed their congressional makeup",
      "Indiana state lawmakers initially resisted the Trump administration's pressure to redraw their map to edge out the two Democratic seats. When Republican Gov. Mike Braun called a special session in November, Senate President Rodric Bray said publicly the votes weren't there, and when the legislature convened, it only agreed to meet again in January for the regular session.",
      "But lawmakers reversed course in November and said they would reconvene to take up redistricting. On Dec. 1, Indiana House Republicans unveiled their proposed map, which significantly changes the boundaries of District 1 and District 7.",
      "In the proposed map, District 1, which includes Gary, Indiana, and other Chicago suburbs, is redrawn so voters would have been spread through Districts 2 and 4. All three districts are between 40-44% Democratic under the proposed map. The map also broke up the heavily Democratic District 7, which currently includes most of Indianapolis and backed Harris with 71% of its vote. It would be split, with its population absorbed into several Republican districts.",
      "Republicans have a trifecta in Indiana government, and although the map passed the Indiana House easily, it failed to garner support in the state Senate. During public hearings on the map, 127 people signed up to testify and of those, just 18 of them backed the bill, while the rest were opposed.",
      "Despite Republicans; 40-10 advantage in the Indiana Senate, the bill failed, with 31 votes against and 19 in favor. Bray indicated it will not come up again during the regular session, saying after the vote \"it's time to turn the page.\" Mr. Trump has vowed to primary Republicans who voted against the measure.",

      "He told CBS News he's trying to be a firewall to block the whitewashing of the history of the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol siege.",
      "\"The only thing that will stop me is if people stop lying about Jan. 6 and just acknowledge what the day was and what really transpired,\" Hodges said.",
      "He was among the more than 140 police officers injured while trying to stop the U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "With Republicans now in control of the White House and Congress and some in the party downplaying the severity of the Capitol siege, there are limited platforms for victims of the attack to talk about its impact on their lives.",
      "Hodges has become a go-to witness for Democrats in congressional hearings about police safety.",
      "The mission generates some stress and conflict for Hodges. At an October subcommittee hearing in the Senate, Hodges watched as three of his fellow witnesses raised their hands, when asked if they supported President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6 attackers, including those who had beaten Hodges. One of the witnesses who raised his hand was a former homeland security secretary during President Trump's first administration.",
      "As the minority in the House and the Senate, Democrats are permitted to call one witness at most hearings, to serve as a \"minority party\" witness who provides a counterpoint to the witnesses called by the majority.",
      "Twice this autumn, Democrats have called on Hodges.",
      "\"The power of Dan Hodges's narrative comes from the self-control he displays,\" said Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat who is the ranking Democrat of a Senate judiciary subcommittee that called Hodges to testify in October. Welch said Hodges, \"erased any of the legitimate anger he may have had about Jan. 6,\u00a0 to just tell us what happened during the hearing.\"",
      "Democrats argue Hodges' testimony and presence at congressional hearings underscores the hypocrisy of Trump supporters who are making public statements in support of tougher laws or policies to protect police at the same time they're downplaying the attacks on law enforcement officers on Jan. 6.",
      "Welch noted that Republicans declined to ask Hodges any questions or speak to him in the hearing room after the testimony.",
      "\"You have to do an immense amount of intellectual and emotional jujitsu to pretend you didn't hear what Hodges said or acknowledge the reality of what he experienced,\" Welch said.",
      "At a Dec. 3 hearing convened by the House Homeland Security Committee titled \"When Badges Become Targets: How Anti-Law Enforcement Rhetoric Fuels Violence Against Officers,\" Hodges testified that Mr. Trump's mass pardon of more than 1,500 Capitol riot defendants emboldens and encourages further violence against police.",
      "\"The press release announcing this hearing made it sound like certain participants were going to spend a few hours scratching their heads and pretending to not understand why threats against law enforcement have risen so sharply this year, and I cannot abide such a farce,\" Hodges said in his opening statement.",
      "Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who called Hodges as a witness for the hearing, said he did so to combat \"pervasive misinformation.\"",
      "Thompson told CBS News, \"Everybody saw Jan. 6 with their own eyes. But Trump has convinced a\u00a0 large percentage of the population that those were not insurrectionists.\"",
      "At an October hearing in the Senate titled \"Politically Violent Attacks: A Threat to Our Constitutional Order,\" Hodges was the sole witness called by Democrats.",
      "\"I am intimately familiar with political violence, as when I fought to defend the United States Capitol and many of your very lives, I was beaten, bloodied, and crushed, with my eye gouged and skull smashed with my own baton,\" Hodges testified.",
      "He criticized Republicans on the panel for not acknowledging the Capitol riot, telling them,\u00a0 \"My colleagues were under attack by a mob.\"",
      "Hodges said Republican members of the panels did not ask him questions about Jan. 6 during the public hearings of the committees, nor did they thank him after the proceedings. Spokespeople for the Republican chairmen of the panels at which Hodges has testified this year did not respond to CBS News requests for comment about Hodges's testimony.",
      "At a House hearing this month in which Hodges appeared as a witness, the Republican chair of the committee opened the proceedings with broader statements about the risk of \"inflammatory rhetoric\" endangering the lives of law enforcement and risking homeland security, including recent rhetoric criticizing federal immigration agents.",
      "Hodges spoke with CBS News as a private citizen, not as a representative of the Metropolitan Police Department in Washington, D.C.",
      "He had testified previously before a national audience, in 2021 at a public hearing of the House Jan. 6 select committee, which investigated the causes and impact of the riot.",
      "Mr. Trump's victory in 2024 and his first-day pardons of the riot defendants have triggered criticisms of the administration that it is ignoring \u2013 or rewriting \u2013 the history of the siege.",
      "In issuing the clemency of Capitol riot defendants, the White House said the President's decision\u00a0 \"ends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "Hodges acknowledges he also has received threats and menacing amid his public statements.",
      "Former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who has attended some congressional hearings to support Hodges, told CBS News, \"Danny has been unwavering and cleared every obstacle he's faced, while continuing to serve.\"",
      "Dunn, who also testified and appeared at hearings of the House Jan. 6 select committee in 2021-22, said, \"Danny's and my mission has been the same. We're seeking accountability and justice against those who were responsible for the worst days of our lives.\"",
      "Hodges told CBS News it will be impossible to convince all Americans about the truth of the impact of Jan. 6 on the police victims. When asked if he's optimistic that the deniers of the violence of the siege will change their minds, Hodges paused before answering.",
      "\"There are still people out there who think the moon landing was fake and that the Holocaust wasn't real,\" he said. \"So you are not going to get 100%.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said \"there's a deal to be had\" on a plan to address health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said Sunday that \"there's a deal to be had\" on addressing health care costs after a pair of bills failed to secure enough support to advance in the Senate last week.",
      "\"There has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans,\" Cassidy said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Last week, the Senate rejected two bills aimed at lowering health care costs, as lawmakers struggle to reach consensus over how to address expiring tax credits that help millions of Americans purchase insurance under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "While Democrats sought a three-year extension of the enhanced tax credits with their bill, Republicans offered their own legislation sponsored by Cassidy. Rather than extending the enhanced tax credits, the measure would redirect funds to health savings accounts for those who use bronze plans on state exchanges, allowing people to save on premiums by switching to the lower-tier plans, while giving them the ability to use the HSA funds toward their deductibles.",
      "The Republican-led measure didn't pick up any support from Democrats during the dueling votes last week. But Cassidy said that in addition to their concern about the premiums, Democrats must acknowledge high deductibles, saying \"you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket.\"",
      "\"I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credit for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket,\" Cassidy added. \"I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.\"",
      "The Louisiana Republican said he's searching for a deal to address the concerns of Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"Let's just meet,\" Cassidy said. \"Let's address our concerns, and then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.\"",
      "The comments come as some senators have expressed tepid optimism in recent days about a path forward on a compromise after last week's partisan exercise. Some Republicans have said they're open to an extension of the enhanced tax credits, with some new limits and on a temporary basis, acknowledging the cliff that around 22 million Americans face with their expiration at the end of the month.",
      "Cassidy argued that with his approach, lawmakers would have until the end of March to implement a solution, \"because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them, and they get reimbursed.\"",
      "\"We can get this done,\" Cassidy said. \"And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.\"",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\" Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia responded to Cassidy's comments. Warner said lawmakers shouldn't wait to address the rising costs, urging them to \"fix it now, so people don't go into Christmas thinking they're going to not know if they're being able to afford health care.\"",
      "\"Fix the crisis right now,\" Warner said. \"Extend the subsidies, and then let's debate how we fix it.\"",

      "(Begin VT)",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuela Opposition Leader): I am not going to give more information regarding my trip to Norway.",
      "But what am I going to say, how important it is for the Venezuelan people. This is a recognition to a nation that has fought tirelessly, courageously against a criminal narco-terrorist structure. And \u2013 and I came to receive that prize, that award, and I'm going to bring it back home to the Venezuelan people as soon as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You say you're going back home. I know you sent your own children out of Venezuelan territory in order to protect them, your sons, your daughter.",
      "Are they concerned that you plan to return to Venezuela? When are you going?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, of course they are concerned, as any other Venezuelan child that has their parents or relatives back in our country, because the regime, as I said, has persecuted, tortured, killed, disappeared thousands of Venezuelans.",
      "And, recently, it has turned even more violent, because, you know, when \u2013 when a criminal regime is falling apart and they know their days are numbered, they turn even more aggressive, even more violent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you help us understand what is going on? Because we are seeing here in the U.S. an increase in the pressure campaign, more sanctions on Venezuelan individuals and vessels. We saw an armed seizure of a vessel carrying oil out of Venezuela.",
      "Selling oil on the black market is really important money for the Maduro regime. Do you endorse this idea of more seizures and possibly even a blockade?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Look, I absolutely support President Trump's strategy.",
      "And we, the Venezuelan people, are very grateful to him and to his administration, because I believe he is a champion of freedom in this hemisphere. And that's why \u2013 and I say this from Oslo right now \u2013 I have dedicated this award to him, because I think that he finally has put Venezuela in where it should be, in terms of a priority for the United States' national security.",
      "And we do support these actions because, Margaret, we are facing not a conventional dictatorship. This is a very complex criminal structure that has turned Venezuela into a safe haven of international crime and terrorist activities, starting with Russia, Iran, Cuba, Hezbollah, Hamas, the Colombian guerrilla, the drug cartels operating freely and directed in partnership with Maduro and his regime.",
      "And, as every criminal structure is \u2013 suffers is when the inflows from their criminal activities are cut. And these, in the case of Maduro regime, comes from the oil black market, to drug trafficking, gold smuggling, arms smuggling, even human smuggling and trafficking.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you support more sanctions and possibly more seizures of oil. But isn't there a risk that cutting off money will further hurt the already impoverished people of Venezuela? Isn't that a risk?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Of course, what we're doing is for the well-being of the Venezuelan people. What we want to do is to save lives.",
      "But Maduro was the one who declared a war on the Venezuelan people, a war we didn't want, a war we are suffering with hundreds of thousands of killings and forced executions in the last years. And, right now, I want to be very clear with the international community.",
      "The resources Maduro gets are not going to schools or hospitals. In Venezuela, a teacher earns $1 a day. Pensions are less than $1 a month. Our children go twice a week to school. The sources, the cash the regime gets from these illegal activities goes to buy arms, to pay gang members, to spy and infiltrate, and to even further increase their illegal narcotics activities and so on.",
      "So these resources are not going for to \u2013 towards the people. They're going for corruption and crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you want even more seizures and a blockade. Is that correct?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We want every legal action through law enforcement approach, not only from the United States, also from other Caribbean, Latin American and European countries, that further block the illegal activities of the regime.",
      "Why? Because we need to increase the cost of staying in power by force. Once you arrive to that point in which the cost of staying in power is higher than the cost of leaving power, the regime will fall apart. And it's the moment where we, you know, advance into a negotiated transition, which is what in the beginning we offered Maduro when we won the presidential election by a landslide last year.",
      "But he not only refused that option, but he, as you know, unleashed the worst, most brutal repression wave we've seen in our history.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And eight million Venezuelans have fled\u2026",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's correct.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 since he came to power, during that time.",
      "But, in terms of the diplomacy, President Trump spoke with Maduro himself last month. We haven't seen any evidence, though, that diplomacy, a negotiated exit like you mentioned, is happening. Are you seeing diplomatic success?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, in the last years, Venezuela has seen 17 dialogue initiatives, not once, not twice, 17.",
      "Every single time, the opposition or our allies or the United States have complied with every single thing we offered. The regime of the country has violated every single thing they offered on their own part. What did they get? They got time. They got legitimacy. They got money.",
      "And that's precisely what they think they can get again \u2013 once again. But, certainly, things have changed very much in the last months. Venezuela is a total different country. I mean, Maduro is weaker than ever. The armed forces, police are certainly divided and fractured, and our country is united, cohesive.",
      "And we finally have the administration, in this case, President Trump, with a clear strategy that truly represents a credible threat for the regime. So if we had \u2013 ever had a chance to finally move ahead into \u2013 towards democracy in our country, it's today.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What evidence do you have that the military is weaker than ever? Was your escape proof of that?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We've seen more and more members of the military finding ways to connect with us, to send messages to \u2013 to \u2013 to show that they are feeling the same of what the rest of the country is feeling.",
      "When \u2013 when they \u2013 this military go back home, they find their children, their mother, their partners saying that they are hungry, that they are persecuted, that their families have been divided. They are scared. Yes, they are scared, because repression and persecution in the military is even tougher than on civilians.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, President Trump said that land strikes to stop drug trafficking specifically will start soon. He has been saying that for weeks. Do you know what he is talking about? And has he promised you anything?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: No, I don't know. And well, if I knew, I wouldn't say it, of course. But it's not the case.",
      "We are not involved and we will not get involved into another nation's policy for their own national security.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you welcome U.S. military action?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I will welcome more and more pressure so that Maduro understands that he has to go, that his time is over.",
      "And I will insist something that I have said several times before. This is not conventional regime change. This cannot be compared to other cases, like countries in the Middle East. We had an election. Regime change was already mandated by over 70 percent of the population. And what we need is support to enforce that decision.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, how do you square military action with receiving a Peace Prize? Are we at the point it's necessary?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, what we're fighting for is precisely freedom in order to have democracy, and democracy in order to have peace.",
      "And in order to maintain freedom and to achieve freedom, you do need strength. The contrary would be the peace of the dead, in which you have a country under absolute oppression and simply giving in. And that's not the case.",
      "It's absolutely absurd that you see a regime, a criminal regime like Maduro, that gets support from Russia or from Iran, and then ask the Venezuelan people not to ask support from democratic countries and democratic leaders.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: That's absolute absurd. We do not have arms. We have our will. We have the power of organization and the power of love, which, at the end, I have to say that peace is ultimately an act of love.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Maduro regime maintains it won the last election and considers Machado a fugitive. The regime also refers to U.S. actions as illegal and brutal interventionism.",
      "In our next half-hour, we will speak with Machado about what's ahead in a potential post-Maduro era in Venezuela.",
      "And we will be back in one minute, so stay with us.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-Virginia): Well, first of all, let me \u2013 at the top of the show, we have got this tragic shooting at Brown University and then this obviously political strike against the Jewish community in Australia, both horrible, and particularly on the first day of Hanukkah, which is the celebration of light over darkness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And, boy, we could use a little more light these days.",
      "Ms. Machado is a hero. She deserves to win the Nobel Prize. And one of the mistakes the Biden administration made last year, when the opposition candidates won overwhelmingly, was not put more pressure on Maduro then to leave. But the action now that Trump has chosen Maduro, who's a bad guy, and saying \u2013 and I'm not sure what his policy is, but at the very same time is pardoning, for example, a Honduran former president who was convicted in America of drug running.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: The president, who has not been willing to stand up strong against Putin, who's probably the most brutal authoritarian leader in the world, as we go on and off with Ukraine.",
      "I think it's \u2013 yes, it'd be great to get rid of Maduro. But in terms of the question\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: \u2026 Donald Trump has not come to the American people and said, here are our goals in Venezuela. We have got troops potentially in harm's way. We have got boat actions, for example, where we're blowing up boats where we can obviously interdict, as we saw with the oil tanker.",
      "I think the president needs to make the case if he's going to try to put boots on the ground in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, at this point, all they have, as I understand it, asked for and justified to Congress were these strikes on the alleged drug boats, nothing with sovereign territory yet.",
      "But that gets to your argument about, what is the end goal? Unlike other Democrats, when it comes to the drug boats, you have said you're not ready to call them war crimes, particularly what happened on the September 2 double tap strike. You have questioned Admiral Bradley.",
      "I know you want the video released to the public. What do you think that's going to show to the public? What will that change?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, I think the video is chilling, disturbing, whatever term you want to use.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Because the idea of these two survivors hanging on to remnants of a boat, and then America taking a series of additional strikes. The Congress needs to see it, at the very minimum. I think the American public needs to see it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have seen it?",

I want to know whether the overarching policy memorandum, which was not finished until September 5, three days after the strike, was it changed?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You \u2013 I saw you said that that's not typical, is it? Don't you normally come up with the legal justification before you take the action, rather than three days after it?",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, this is where I have a question.",
      "The justification was made in late July. They didn't write it down until September 5.",

      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Can \u2013 I don't have the answer.",
      "I also want to see the after-action report. I want to give the military every opportunity to make their case, because once you \u2013 again, once you make that claim, what it would do to how we view our military, morale, how we're viewed in the world, it's so important.",
      "But this president has not \u2013 and, frankly, Pete Hegseth even worse. Here's the guy who goes out and brags about the strikes, until there's controversy, and then he kind of runs for the hills.",

      "I think our troops have played an important role. We are working closely with, for example, the Kurds. We have literally tens of thousands of ISIS family members in certain prisons in that area. But the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want that to continue?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But the president \u2013 I think pulling out without a plan would be a mistake, but the president, again, has sent mixed signals.",
      "I mean, months ago, he said he's thinking about taking all those American soldiers out without articulating a strategy. I mean, the president, if he wants to make the case to the American people of when our soldiers are in harm's way, and particularly when we're talking about the Caribbean, and now potential Venezuela, this has not been an overnight \u2013 this buildup of forces been months.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up three percent year over year, Personal Consumption Index is up 2.8 percent year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, one the things that, if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that have \u2013 we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on.",
      "And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up nine percent. So far this year they're down 0.6 percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Eggs. He was talking about eggs. Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, he was talking about eggs.",
      "And so, I think the \u2013 the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and an accommodated Fed policy. And I think that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well, I \u2013 you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So, right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of two percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean the president told \"The Wall Street Journal,\" he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, \"and help voters. All I can do is my job.\"",
      "When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that \u2013 and you guys have been covering it a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown, where everybody's really upset.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the vibe session, right?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, but \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The data's good, but people feel bad.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But what happened \u2013 yes, but what's going to happen is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Same thing, you're saying?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, what's going to happen \u2013 I'm not saying that. What I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is four percent. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look in their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever. And so on.",
      "And so, I think that the sentiment \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher incomes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about 3,000. So far this year it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So, for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So, that's like an extra more than thousand dollars a year you have to spend on groceries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Uh-huh.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: It's down this year for us, the grocery package. But it's still got a lot of room to grow \u2013 or to go.",

      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Without it hurting?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, well, I'm not a foreign policy guy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: So, like what we do with Venezuela, whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio.",
      "But I can say that \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you've got the leeway, right? Pricing (ph).",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: That what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No, because \u2013 because there's \u2013 they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get, like, sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: And that's what we're trying to slow down.",

      "We also this survey from The Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen. And they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase.",
      "Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so, I think that we're at a certain case \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so, maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday and we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys, like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these were CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: But they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when he get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I trust the household survey especially. And, sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November and that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",

I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and the \u2013 to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be. And to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk. And he's \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: No. No. The \u2013 he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good. You know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",

      "Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY (R-LA): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, your health care bill gives Americans up to $1,500 in tax-free accounts to spend on health care rather than extend these expiring ACA subsidies. On Thursday, your proposal failed 51-48, as did the Democratic proposal. So that means it looks like those receiving ACA premium subsidies will see their costs go up 114 percent. Bottom line here, did Republicans simply wait too long to come up with a health care alternative?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, first, Margaret, let's just kind of recap the question. We've got to do something for affordability for the people in the exchanges. And I will say that the only thing that Democrats would accept was something that would decrease the premiums. But if a family has a $6,000 out of pocket before they get into the strength of the insurance plan, then frankly the policy is catastrophic. It brings profit to the insurance company, but not benefit to the patient.",
      "So, I would argue that it actually is \u2013 there has to be a meeting of the minds between Democrats and Republicans. Let's acknowledge, you've got to put cash in the patient's pocket to pay the out of pocket. I would be willing to do a short-term extension of the premium tax credits for those people with higher premiums if they will concede that we've got to do something for the $6,000 out of pocket. I think there's a deal to be had here. We need to push for that deal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you want to make sure that the average deductible is less than $6,000 is what I just heard you say there, and you're open to an",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Absolutely. The net deductible, if you will \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: That $1,500 is per person. Give me a couple \u2013 you know, for people over 50, give me a couple in their 50s with two children, 18 and 19. They would get $5,000 in an account, in their purse, pocketbook, you name it, in their pocket to pay the out of pocket for the insurance. Now, the insurance plan for that couple would be a $6,000 deductible. So, you end up decreasing the net deductible by doing this. That makes the policy actually functional for them. If the child has a sprained ankle and you bring to the urgent care, you can pay the bill, not kind of come with - - come at a \u2013 come forward out of your own pocket.",
      "By the way, I'm told that about 40 percent of Americans have less than $1,000 in their savings account. That kind of puts into relief why you need to have something in their pocket to pay the out of pocket.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "So, I know the president has said that he likes the concept of your plan, but why didn't the White House put its shoulder behind this before Thursday? Why didn't they whip votes for you? Four of your Republican colleagues crossed the aisle and voted with Democrats on their proposal.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: All four of those voted for our proposal, too. And I think that shows you that there is \u2013 there is interest in finding something which addresses both the critical problem of the out-of-pocket expense, but also the higher premiums.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the White House behind you on this? Like, are they helping you if you're trying another \u2013",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Well, it certainly seemed like it. Their \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want this up for another vote?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Their initial plan had elements of what I am speaking about, helping people with that deductible. So, simply put, yes, the White House is there. But if you notice, our problem was not on the Republican side, our problem was on the Democratic side. So, what I'm saying is, is let's just meet together.",
      "As a physician, I can tell you, that deductible, the patient comes, she's stressed. She can't get the procedure, the x-ray, the whatever, because of her $6,000 deductible. Let's just meet. Let's address her concerns. And then this Republican would be willing to do something on a short-term extension of the premium tax credits if that's what it takes to get the deal to help those folks with the more expensive premium, but also helping everybody with their deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you need more White House help on this? And, sir, you're running out of time here. Do you really think you can get this done before January 1st?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: Our problem is not with Republicans. Our problem has been with Democrats. But, of course, they may say that about us. So, what I am kind of searching for is a deal in which both have their concerns addressed. If you do that and you put this in place, you really have until the end of, like, March to get it done because with these kind of accounts that people have money in, they just save the receipts, they submit them and they get reimburse. It happens \u2013 it's what we do in my family. We have a flexible spending account.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: And so, we can get this done. And I think we can meet the concerns, both about the out of pocket, but also about the premium.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I also want to ask you about what's happening with the FDA right now. CBS has confirmed that there are no ongoing safety studies into the abortion drug Mifepristone. This was despite the Trump administration saying they were going to conduct one, and anti-abortion groups want this review to take place.",
      "I saw a letter the FDA commissioner sent to you last week claiming they are reviewing the evidence. Do you believe him? And if not, what are you doing about it?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I had a conversation with the commissioner this past week. It seems as if it's taken a long time to get that study up and going, which suggests to me that it's not a priority. For the pro-life community, this should be a priority. And if we're going to make America healthy again, this seems like, my gosh, should be top priority.",
      "So, there is \u2013 I am disappointed, as well as others are disappointed, by the way this is being slow-walked. I think \u2013 I think it just needs to happen. We need to have the evidence out there.",
      "If you want to reassure the American people about something which is really top of mind, this is where they should be going.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that Mifepristone is safe and effective and that there are side effects in less than 1 percent of patients. I \u2013 with that data point in place, why isn't the White House pressing the FDA commissioner to make this happen? There's some suggestion in reporting that it is for political concerns due to impact on the upcoming midterm races. Is this politically motivated, the slow-walking you say is happening?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: You're asking me to look into the kind of motivations of folks with whom I've not had a personal conversation. I can't do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, did the FDA commissioners say that?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: The FDA commissioners said that they're trying to get the study together. But they've been in office long enough that it could be. And so, I think that it's right to be impatient. It's right to demand more.",
      "I don't know if the decision starts with the FDA commissioner. You just suggested it starts in the White House. That might be the case. Point being, get it done.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you have confidence in the FDA commissioner?",
      "SENATOR BILL CASSIDY: I think the FDA commissioner is working very hard. And I think that, in many cases, he's receiving directives from on high. I don't know that for sure, but I suspect that's the case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy, we thank you for your time.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Here's more of our exclusive interview with Venezuelan opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado.",
      "(BEGIN VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The regime itself has done a number of things. They have revoked TV licenses for journalists to broadcast truthfully. He has jailed journalists. The United Nations says the national guard targeted political opponents, committed sexual violence, tortured people and committed other crimes against humanity.",
      "So, from where you sit, is Maduro stepping down enough, or do you need the entire regime dismantled, in which case that sounds like a country in collapse.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO (Venezuelan Opposition Leader): That's a very good question because certainly Maduro is the head of the structure, but it's like any other mafia system. You have families or groups that operate and sometimes even compete among each other.",
      "There are different degrees in the crimes they have committed. Certainly those that have committed crimes against humanity, that have been reported by the fact finding missions (ph) of the United Nations should face justice. Local justice and international justice.",
      "There are other members of the regime or the armed forces that have committed lesser crimes. And certainly we will search for justice, not revenge.",
      "But this, I'm going to insist, what we're living right now is chaos. Maduro represents chaos. We're going to put order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. But respectfully, you also have acknowledged that the drug cartels are exploiting your country. That Russia is exploiting your country, Iran, Cuba, China.",
      "Just yesterday, Vladimir Putin spoke with Maduro and said their strategic partnership is growing. Are you concerned here that Russia is going to shore up support for the military and intelligence?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Well, I'm absolutely convinced that Putin wants the world to think that, and especially wants President Trump to think that. But I would ask you a question. Do you think Putin has resources to spare at this time or does he have something that's more urgent for him to invest those resources? I mean helping a regime that is going to fall apart anyway, regardless of what he does, I don't think it's a priority for him.",
      "Nonetheless, I do not underestimate what the (INAUDIBLE) actors of Tarismo (ph) might be planning to do once we are in that transition to democracy. And that will require very efficient actions to isolate and neutralize those threats.",
      "And, you know, we work very hard to understand what's the true nature of our armed forces right now, identifying those military which we believe could be supportive of a transition to democracy and new government \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have they pledged that to you?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Some of them, yes. And we believe that over 80 percent of our armed forces will join in support the democratic movement once the transition is in place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, tell me about that transition. What kind of support do you need to keep the country together, to prevent another refugee crisis? And do you have that pledge from the American government now?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: We will need a lot of support, advice, information, technology, not only from the United States, also from multilateral organizations, some of which we're already working together. Not only in security issues, but power supply, food supply, how do we bring \u2013 you know, put order in our financial accounts. How do we restructure our debt. How we open markets for international investment and give security to international investment in oil and gas and infrastructure, critical minerals. I mean, Venezuela is unique in terms of the amount of the natural endowments we have.",
      "And, you know, we're located three hours by plane from Florida. So, it's hard to think, you know, in this shortening of the supply chains that is in the (INAUDIBLE) shoring process taking place, a better ally in the region than Venezuela.",
      "At the same time, you know, turning Venezuela from the criminal hub of the Americas into a security shield for the United States and for the rest of the region is a top priority for all.",
      "So, you know, we have the plans ready. We have the teams ready. We know what we have to do, the first 100 hours, and the next 100 days. And most importantly, and I want to insist on this, we have the people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would that include U.S. peacekeeping troops or other troops on the ground?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I'm \u2013 I cannot answer that question right now. I don't think that's the case. There are other countries that have offered support as well in order to strengthen democratic institutions once the government elect is in place. But the \u2013 we will have to address that once we have the, you know, the government elect in place and put in order, bringing order back to our country.",
      "And one thing that you mentioned for \u2013 about the, you know, the refugee crisis, it's going to be exactly the country. The day Maduro goes, you will see tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants coming back home from the United States and all over the world. I mean our diaspora is desperate to go back to Venezuela. So even from that perspective, it is a win-win situation to have democracy in Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think it is safe for those Venezuelans in America to go back there now? Some temporary protected status was just revoked bit the president for more than half a million Venezuelans here. Is it safe for them?",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: Absolutely not. It will be safe once Maduro is gone and every single citizen will be, you know, living freedom and respect towards the law. We will bring back rule of law. We will liberate our political prisoners. And everybody will be free to speak out what they feel, what they think, what they want for the future of their \u2013 for their own future and their families.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Maria Corina Machado, we thank you for your time today. And we will be watching.",
      "MARIA CORINA MACHADO: I thank you and again (ph) for this great opportunity. And God bless Venezuela. Venezuela will be free.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett tthat aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Dec. 14, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And voice should be heard is going to be--",
      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 12 Dec 2025 14:41:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Super-Earth TOI-561b is about 40 times closer to its host star than Mercury is to the sun.",
    "story": [
      "A rocky exoplanet outside the Earth's solar system may have an atmosphere, according to new evidence gathered by NASA researchers.",
      "The exoplanet, known as super-Earth TOI-561b, was discovered in 2020, according to NASA. Scientists have determined that the planet is ultra-hot, with a low density. It is about 1.4 times wider than Earth and orbits the sun in about 11 hours. Its host star is similar to Earth's sun in size and temperature, but the exoplanet is 40 times closer to that star than Mercury is to the sun, NASA said in a news release. Observations suggest the exoplanet has a global magma ocean and that it is surrounded by a thick layer of gas.",
      "The exoplanet's low density has surprised and baffled scientists, NASA said. It may have an unusual composition from planets in Earth's solar system. It could also be surrounded by a thick atmosphere, which would not be expected on an exoplanet with these features. But the James Webb Space Telescope helped scientists gather data that showed that unlikely scenario might be the case.",
      "Researchers used the telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph to measure the exoplanet's dayside temperature. If the exoplanet has no atmosphere, scientists estimated its dayside temperature would be about 4,900 degrees Fahrenheit. But the spectrograph found TOI-561b's temperature closer to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit, far cooler than expected.",
      "Just determining the temperature of the exoplanet doesn't confirm if there is an atmosphere there, NASA said. The magma ocean could cause heat to circulate, or a thin layer of rock vapor could help cool the planet. But neither of those options is likely to account for the difference between the measured temperatures and what scientists expected.",
      "\"We really need a thick volatile-rich atmosphere to explain all the observations,\" said Anjali Piette, a researcher from England's University of Birmingham and a co-author of a study published Thursday that detailed the discoveries.",
      "Piette said an atmosphere would allow gases like water vapor to absorb some wavelengths of light, keeping the telescope's spectrograph from measuring them actually. The exoplanet may also have bright silicate clouds that can reflect starlight to cool the atmosphere, Piette said.",
      "Scientists suspect there may be some form of equilibrium between the exoplanet's atmosphere and its magma ocean, said study co-author Tim Lichtenberg, a researcher from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands.",
      "\"At the same time that gases are coming out of the planet to feed the atmosphere, the magma ocean is sucking them back into the interior,\" Lichtenberg said. \"This planet must be much, much more volatile-rich than Earth to explain the observations. It's really like a wet lava ball.\"",
      "Scientists will learn more about TOI-561b as they study a data set gathered by the Webb telescope after it observed the exoplanet for more than 37 hours. The work will involve mapping the exoplanet's temperature and learning what its atmosphere may be made of.",
      "\"What's really exciting is that this new data set is opening up even more questions than it's answering,\" said Johanna Teske, the paper's lead author and a staff scientist at the Carnegie Science Earth and Planets Laboratory.",

    "story": [
      "Time magazine is spotlighting key players in the artificial intelligence revolution\u00a0for its 2025 Person of the Year, the magazine announced Thursday. \"The architects of AI\" are the latest recipients of the designation, which for more than a century has been given out on an annual basis to an influential person, group of people or, occasionally, a defining\u00a0cultural theme\u00a0or idea.",
      "Previous Person of the Year title-holders have held varying roles in a vast range of occupations, with President Trump taking last year's cover and Taylor Swift capturing the one before. In 2025,",
      "Time's 2025 honorific was given to the minds and financiers behind AI's rise to renown and notoriety, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son and Baidu CEO Robin Li, who spoke directly with the magazine for its feature story.",
      "\"Person of the Year is a powerful way to focus the world's attention on the people that shape our lives,\" wrote Sam Jacobs, Time's editor-in-chief, in\u00a0an editorial piece\u00a0about the magazine's decision. \"And this year, no one had a greater impact than the individuals who imagined, designed, and built AI.\"",
      "Jacobs described 2025 as \"the year when artificial intelligence's full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back or opting out,\" adding: \"Whatever the question was, AI was the answer.\"",
      "The magazine prepared two separate covers for the issue. In one, artist Jason Seiler painted an interpretative recreation of the iconic 1932 photograph \"Lunch Atop a Skyscraper,\" an image that depicted workers seated side-by-side on a steel beam hanging high above New York City during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, which became a symbol of American resilience during the Great Depression.",
      "A cast of tech industry characters at the forefront of AI development are perched on the beam in Seiler's recreation. Mark Zuckerberg, of Meta, Lisa Su, of Advanced Micro Devices,\u00a0Elon Musk, of xAI, Sam Altman, of Open AI, Demis Hassabis, of DeepMind Technologies, Dario Amodei, of Anthropic, and Fei-Fei Li, of Stanford's Human-Centered AI Institute, are all pictured, along with Huang.",
      "The second cover illustration, by artist Peter Crowther, places the same executives among scaffolding at what looks like a construction site for the giant letters \"AI.\"",
      "\"Every industry needs it, every company uses it, and every nation needs to build it,\" Huang said of balancing the pressures to implement AI responsibly and deploy it to the public as quickly as possible. \"This is the single most impactful technology of our time.\"",
      "Most of the industry figures pictured on Time's cover did not speak to the magazine for the story, so this year's spread mainly focuses on the implications \u2014 positive, negative and in between \u2014 of the companies they have built and the technology they continue forging.",
      "AI often took center stage in 2025 in investigative news reports, economic and academic studies, and in Washington, D.C., as policymakers grappled with how to regulate its evolution while tech giants scrambled to trump their competitors' inventions, as the use of some of them, like chatbots, grew to be commonplace, at times with tragic consequences.",
      "\"For these reasons, we recognize a force that has dominated the year's headlines, for better or for worse,\" Jacobs wrote in his editorial. \"For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the possible, the Architects of AI are TIME's 2025 Person of the Year.\"",

      "With the world's first social media ban for teenagers under 16 now in effect in Australia, its initial political architect is celebrating a new less-digital era for millions of children \u2014 and sharing that the legislation was personally inspired by his wife, for their four children.",
      "\"She read a book called 'The Anxious Generation,' by Jonathan Haidt,\" said Peter Malinauskas, the premier of the state of South Australia. \"And I will never forget the night she finished reading the book and she put it down on her lap and she turned to me and said, 'You better do something about this!'\"",
      "Within seven months, and with strong public support, that idea fast became law across the land, winning support from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Ten major apps including TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit and Facebook have complied to bar everyone 16 and under from their accounts and from setting up new accounts.",
      "\"Heaven forbid they might talk to one another a bit more, pick up the phone and have a chat rather than just being obsessed with the screen,\" said Maulinauskas.",
      "The ban puts the onus of responsibility on social media companies rather than parents with a penalty of up to $33 million if found to be in breach. It allows for each company to decide how best to adhere, which must be \"multi-layered,\" using more than one kind of identity verification, which could include traditional methods including national IDs and passports but also artificial intelligence \u2014 controversial over possible inaccuracies \u2014 to scan facial features for age.",
      "Malinauskas readily admits there will be growing pains.",
      "\"People will find ways around it and lots of things will go wrong, and that'll be highlighted in coming days and weeks in Australia,\" he said, \"but on balance, this is a reform that parents want so they can do their job more easily.\"",
      "He says officials from North America, Europe and Asia have been speaking with him about advancing similar legislation in Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. Malaysia is already on track to be the next country to ban those under 16 from social media in 2026.",
      "Yet in Australia, the law already faces a legal challenge. The country's High Court accepted a legal challenge from two 15-year-olds who assert the ban violates their freedom of communication. The case could be heard as early as February.",
      "Malinauskas blames those companies for putting all children through \"a global experiment\" over the past decade with \"social media addiction and overuse because many of these platforms have had addictive algorithms.\"",
      "\"I'm really proud, really proud that we've been able to see South Australia and then Australia lead a reform that's going to make a big difference to young people's lives,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 10 Dec 2025 11:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "For thousands of parents in 39 countries, including the U.S., the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
    "story": [
      "Suffolk, England - For parents Daisy Greenwell and Joe Ryrie, freedom means looking up at the world around them instead of down at their phones, and they're determined to pass that sense of non-digital liberty on to their children.",
      "Their daughter started asking for a smartphone when she was just eight years old, because her classmates were getting them. The pressure to have a phone at such a young age surprised Greenwell, and pushed her to look more closely at the trend.",
      "She found a growing body of research suggesting that heavy smartphone use may negatively impact young people's mental health.",
      "The more she read, the more concerned she became, so Greenwell decided to take action. She posted a question on Instagram: What if we could switch the norm? What if parents united to create a \"smartphone-free childhood?\"",
      "The response was immediate.",
      "\"That post went viral,\" she told CBS News. \"Thousands of parents joined the group overnight.\"",
      "Within a couple weeks, Greenwell said there were smartphone-free childhood groups in every county in England. One year later, the grassroots campaign has expanded far beyond the U.K. borders.",
      "The group \u2014 Smartphone Free Childhood \u2014 now has chapters in 39 countries.",
      "For Greenwell, Ryrie and the thousands of families who've joined the movement, the goal is simple: More time outdoors, and a childhood lived offline as much as possible.",
      "In the U.S., the movement even inspired a cautionary viral advertisement, highlighting the dangers of giving children unrestricted access to the internet. A parent in the ad tells their child: \"There's a box in the corner with all the pornographic material ever made. I'm trusting you not to look in there, okay?\"",
      "The backlash against youth consumption of social media has drawn the attention of governments globally. On Wednesday, Australia became the first country in the world to enact a ban on social media accounts for children under the age of 16. The law compels huge tech companies such as Meta and TikTok to enforce age restrictions, or face hefty fines.",
      "In the U.K., national Culture Minister Lisa Nandy said the government would be keeping a \"close eye\" on Australia's social media ban, but added that there were no current plans to replicate the legislation.",
      "At a grassroots level, however, parents who join Greenwell and Ryrie's movement are asked to sign a pact: No smartphones for the kids before they turn 14, and no social media before 16.",
      "\"This isn't an anti-tech movement, it's a pro-childhood movement. We're not saying no smartphones ever. We're just saying children don't need unrestricted internet access in their pockets 24/7,\" Ryrie told CBS News.",
      "When asked what she'd tell busy working parents who rely on phones for convenience, Greenwell acknowledged the challenge.",
      "\"It's really tough,\" she said. \"But delaying the smartphone is free, it's simple, and it gives your child the best chance to thrive.\"",
      "Many families are turning to basic \"brick phones\" as alternatives \u2014 devices that allow calls and texts, but limit internet access. Sales of such \"dumb\" devices have risen 150% among 18-24 year olds in the United States, according to a study by the peer-reviewed journal Partners Universal Innovative Research Publication.",
      "Despite the momentum, Greenwell says there's still a cultural norm to disrupt, and available data highlights that point. One in four British kids between the ages of 5 and 7 already own a smartphone, according to the U.K.'s independent media regulator Ofcom.",

    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "summary": "Recently released emails document Jeffrey Epstein's involvement in Leon Black's personal affairs.",
    "story": [
      "Documents released by Congress shed new light on Jeffrey Epstein's role in an attempt to help billionaire Leon Black squelch an accusation of sexual impropriety.",
      "Epstein's relationship with Black has already faced extensive scrutiny, but recently released, previously unreported emails from the House Oversight Committee document Epstein's involvement in Black's personal affairs while the private equity investor paid him huge sums for wealth management advice.",
      "Black, the co-founder of Apollo Global Management, had a six-year affair with a former Russian model named Guzel Ganieva, whom he met at a party in New York City in 2008, according to court records. It was a relationship that ended in acrimony, with Ganieva accusing Black of sexual abuse \u2014 allegations Black denies.",
      "As Black prepared a nondisclosure agreement to secure Ganieva's silence about their affair and her allegations of abuse, Epstein offered him some advice. Epstein suggested in a Sept. 21, 2015, email that Black hire former law enforcement officers to approach Ganieva about the agreement.",
      "\"Choose method of message delivery, my choice. - two highly respected former ---- fill in the blank, immigration, scotland yard. sfo. . who may knock on her door and present the terms,\" Epstein wrote in his typical email style, forsaking standard grammar and punctuation.",
      "Black had learned that Ganieva was planning to travel from London to New York to confront him. And Epstein suggested a similar approach if she showed up stateside. \"Have the same types of individuals [available] in new york if she decides to return as stated.. i prefer former fbi, or immigration one man one woman.\"",
      "Epstein did not mention Ganieva by name, but details in the email make it clear he's referring to her. A spokesperson for Black did not dispute that conclusion. An attorney for Ganieva declined to comment.",
      "Epstein penned a follow-up email minutes later, giving Black's assistant and attorney further instructions. Epstein wrote that Black's assistant \"should set up a separate email account for this correspondence. she currently is on an apollo server.\"",
      "No other emails in the trove released by Congress appear to address Black's long-running dispute with Ganieva.",
      "Ernest Badway, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement attorney who frequently represents clients in internal investigations, said an exchange of this nature should have set off red flags inside his company when they later looked into Black's ties to Epstein.",
      "\"As an investigator, that would concern me if I saw an email that people sent on the business's server saying, 'set up a private email so we can have private conversations.' You know, what are those private conversations about?\" Badway said.",
      "Epstein spent years forging relationships that bridged his business interests with his connections to international law enforcement and intelligence figures \u2014 including some powerful players in Russia. He engaged in transactions with Russian banks involving hundreds of millions of dollars, a congressional investigator, Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, said in July. He frequently met with Vitaly Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, until Churkin's death in 2017. And he nurtured a relationship with former Russian Deputy Minister of Economic Development Sergey Belyakov \u2014 a reputed FSB agent.",
      "In the summer of 2015, Epstein reached out to Belyakov for information on Ganieva to determine whether she was working for the Russian government, according to The Dossier Center, a website run by former Russian oligarch and Putin critic Mikhail Kordokovsky.",
      "On Oct. 18, 2015, Ganieva signed a nondisclosure contract with Black in which the billionaire agreed to pay her $100,000 monthly for 15 years, forgive a $1 million loan and provide two million British pounds for her to obtain legal status in the U.K.",
      "Two months later, Epstein emailed Black seeking additional payments for his financial advice.",
      "\"As you are well aware, There is little I won't do for you, or at least try to do as a friend, and a great deal that I have already done ( both known and some things that will need (sp) to remain unknown.)\" Epstein wrote.",
      "The nondisclosure agreement broke down four years later, leading to a series of lawsuits and countersuits. Court filings show Black discussed Ganieva's deal with two people, Epstein and a private investigator. It's unclear if Black turned to the private investigator \u2014 who had spent decades working for the U.S. Department of Justice \u2014 because Epstein had suggested hiring ex-law enforcement.",
      "Susan Estrich, an attorney for Black, told CBS News that his relationship with Epstein has already been the subject of an internal investigation commissioned by Apollo, and conducted by the law firm Dechert LLP.",
      "\"Epstein's emails, to which Mr. Black never responded, make it clear that Epstein was a braggart who embellished and exaggerated his role and responsibilities in many ways,\" Estrich said. \"Mr. Black's consensual relationship with Ms. Ganieva ended with an amicable settlement in 2015 and a voluntary non-disclosure agreement. Ms. Ganieva's unfounded lawsuit against Mr. Black has been dismissed by the trial court and that decision was upheld on appeal.\"",
      "The Dechert investigation concluded that Black paid Epstein $158 million for work related to his family office, \"and that Black genuinely believed that Epstein was extremely smart, capable, and saved him substantial amounts of money.\" The Dechert report made no mention of any effort by Epstein to advise Black regarding Ganieva \u2014 only that Black had \"confided\" in Epstein about certain personal matters.",
      "\"Mr. Black asked for an independent investigation of his relationship with Jeffery Epstein and Dechert investigated and reviewed more than 60,000 documents and concluded that Mr. Black paid Epstein for estate planning and tax advice, no more, no less,\" Estrich said.",
      "It's unclear if the two emails about Ganieva were among those turned over to Dechert's investigators. The Dechert investigation was led by Andrew Levander, a former federal prosecutor. Levander, who also represented former CBS CEO Les Moonves when he was the focus of an internal investigation in 2018, declined to comment.",
      "Black stepped down from the company he founded in March 2021, citing health concerns, two months after the Dechert report was finalized.",
      "Sen. Wyden \u2014 who has spent nearly four years investigating the financial relationship between Black and Epstein \u2014 says Black's payments to Epstein actually reached $170 million and he does not believe the emerging picture matches Black's explanation for paying Epstein nine-figure \"fees\" for tax advice.",
      "\"All along Mr. Black's story has been that he, a multi-billionaire Wall Street titan who employed the finest tax and estate planning minds in America, had to pay astronomical rates for special tax advice from Jeffrey Epstein, who was neither a tax attorney nor an accountant,\" Wyden told CBS News. \"I've never found Black's account believable, and every new revelation in this case raises more troubling questions about what really motivated his payments to Epstein and whether previous investigations of this matter covered up the truth.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles after she was quoted offering blunt assessments of his inner circle in Vanity Fair.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump and members of his Cabinet defended White House chief of staff Susie Wiles on Tuesday after Vanity Fair published a lengthy piece featuring her blunt assessment of the president's inner circle, his first year in office and the president himself.",
      "The two-part story, written by author Chris Whipple, features quotes from 11 interviews that Whipple conducted with Wiles from Jan. 11 to Nov. 5.",
      "According to Vanity Fair, Wiles said the president, who doesn't drink, has \"an alcoholic's personality.\"",
      "\"High-functioning alcoholics or alcoholics in general, their personalities are exaggerated when they drink,\" Wiles said, according to Vanity Fair. \"And so I'm a little bit of an expert in big personalities.\" Wiles was quoted as saying the president operates with the view that there's \"nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing.\"",
      "The president told the New York Post he hadn't read the Vanity Fair piece, but said Wiles is \"fantastic.\" Mr. Trump also defended Wiles' description of him.",
      "\"No, she meant that I'm \u2014 you see, I don't drink alcohol,\" the president told the Post. \"So everybody knows that \u2014 but I've often said that if I did, I'd have a very good chance of being an alcoholic. I have said that many times about myself, I do. It's a very possessive personality.\"",
      "He continued: \"I've said that many times about myself. I'm fortunate I'm not a drinker. If I did, I could very well, because I've said that \u2014 what's the word? Not possessive \u2014 possessive and addictive type personality. Oh, I've said it many times, many times before.\"",
      "Wiles was also quoted as saying Vice President JD Vance has \"been a conspiracy theorist for a decade,\" and that Attorney General Pam Bondi \"completely whiffed\" on her handling of the Epstein files. She also criticized Elon Musk and the way the U.S. Agency for International Development was shuttered in the early months of the administration.",
      "\"No rational person could think the USAID process was a good one,\" she said in the story. \"Nobody.\"",
      "In a post on X, her first in more than a year, Wiles, 68, called the story a \"disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she wrote. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Wiles' statement did not deny that she was accurately quoted. CBS News has asked Vanity Fair for any additional comment and whether the publication will be releasing a transcript or audio of the interviews.",
      "Wiles, a longtime political operative in Florida, became the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff when Mr. Trump took office in January. She was named to Forbes' 2025 list of the World's Most Powerful Women earlier this month.",
      "Top administration officials came to Wiles' defense after the Vanity Fair story was published, with White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt reposting many of their comments.",
      "Office of Management and Budget director Russ Vought, whom Wiles called a \"right-wing absolute zealot\" in the story, called Wiles \"an exceptional chief of staff.\"",
      "\"In my portfolio, she is always an ally in helping me deliver for the president,\" Vought wrote on X. \"And this hit piece will not slow us down.\"",
      "Despite Wiles' criticism of her handling of the Epstein files, Bondi wrote on X: \"My dear friend Susie Wiles fights every day to advance President Trump's agenda \u2013 and she does so with grace, loyalty, and historic effectiveness. Any attempt to divide this administration will fail. Any attempt to undermine and downplay President Trump's monumental achievements will fail. We are family. We are united.\"",
      "\"This is what the Left does: trash & smear our best & most effective people,\" Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth wrote. \"They do it to President Trump daily \u2014 and now to Chief Susie Wiles. Susie is the most TRUSTED, most PROFESSIONAL & most EFFECTIVE Chief of Staff of my lifetime. Absolutely nobody better!\"",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy wrote that the \"radical left is at it again, trying to create discord on President Trump's team,\" adding that \"It won't work because we know & love Susie Wiles.\"",
      "The vice president was asked about the \"conspiracy theorist\" comment by reporters during a trip to Pennsylvania. Vance said he hadn't read the article yet but had heard about it.",
      "\"Sometimes I am a conspiracy theorist, but I only believe in the conspiracy theories that are true,\" Vance said.",
      "\"And by the way, Susie and I have joked in private and in public about that for a long time,\" Vance continued. \"For example, I believed in the crazy conspiracy theory back in 2020 that it was stupid to mask three-year-olds at the height of the COVID pandemic, that we should actually let them develop some language skills. I believed in this crazy conspiracy theory that the media and the government were covering up the fact that Joe Biden was clearly unable to do the job.\"",
      "He added: \"If any of us have learned a lesson from that Vanity Fair article, I hope that the lesson is we should be giving fewer interviews to mainstream media outlets.\"",

Mr. Trump was in Florida at the time.",

    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",

    "summary": "The family of Tony Hsieh, who died at 46, is disputing a will that emerged in 2025, allegedly from a Pakistani man with no ties to the businessman.",
    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X that the Justice Department and FBI \"prevented what would have been a massive and horrific terror plot in the Central District of California,\" which encompasses Los Angeles and Orange County.",

Bondi described the Turtle Island Liberation Front as a \"far-left, pro-Palestine, anti-government, and anti-capitalist group.\"",
      "Bill Essayli, who leads the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles, said at a press conference that the four individuals were arrested Friday in San Bernardino County, where they gathered to construct and detonate test explosive devices in the Mojave Desert. He said the suspects allegedly crafted a \"detailed, coordinated plot\" to bomb two U.S. companies on New Year's Eve, with the devices simultaneously exploding at midnight. Essayli did not name the companies but said they were \"logistics centers.\"",
      "\"This case is another reminder about the dangers that radicalized antifa-like groups pose to people, public safety and the rule of law,\" he said.",
      "The defendants are identified in court papers as Audrey Carroll, Zachary Page, Dante Gaffield and Tina Lai.",
      "Officials played a video that they said showed defendants gathering in the desert to test the bombs. The footage was taken by a surveillance plane, according to Essayli, and FBI agents arrested the defendants soon after. An affidavit from the FBI said that the co-conspirators unloaded bomb-making materials from cars and started to assemble the materials in a table under a tent while they were in the Mojave Desert. The FBI intervened before the four defendants could finish assembling a functional bomb, according to the court filings.",
      "All four of the defendants are from the Los Angeles-area and have been charged with conspiracy and possession of an unregistered destructive device. Additional charges could be filed in the coming weeks, according to Essayli. He described the suspects as \"radical, anti-government members\" of the Turtle Island Liberation Front.",
      "A fifth person, Micah James Legnon, was arrested in Louisiana and charged with one count of making threats in interstate commerce. A FBI agent said in an\u00a0affidavit that Legnon appears to be a member of the Turtle Island Liberation Front and \"intended to travel to New Orleans to carry out an attack by means of weapons.\" Legnon, who served in the U.S. Marines, was stopped by law enforcement on a highway in Louisiana on Friday and had an assault rifle, pistol, gas canister, and body armor in his car, according to court papers.",
      "The Turtle Island Liberation Front describes itself on Facebook as a political organization that seeks \"liberation of occupied Turtle Island and liberation of all colonized people across the world.\" Turtle Island is the name used by some Indigenous peoples for North America.",
      "The group has expressed pro-Palestinian messages on social media and has said it is fighting against \"fascist colonizers.\" It has urged followers to bring Palestinian flags to protests.",
      "An Instagram account for the group's Los Angeles chapter\u00a0says it advocates for \"liberation through decolonization and tribal sovereignty.\" The group does not appear to be particularly well-known: its Instagram account had fewer than 900 followers as of Monday morning, and its Facebook page was followed by just 32 users.",
      "Mr. Trump has targeted far-left groups and movements as leading domestic terrorism threats. In September, the president signed a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0calling for the creation of a \"national strategy to investigate and disrupt networks, entities, and organizations that foment political violence,\" as well as investigations into organizations that he believes engage in political violence. He claimed that violent conduct is animated by \"anti-Americanism, anti-capitalism, and anti-Christianity\" views.",
      "Mr. Trump also\u00a0signed an executive order labeling antifa as a \"domestic terrorist organization,\" even though antifa is a political movement with no official leadership or organization structure.",
      "Michael Kenney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh who researches high-risk activism and political violence, said the Turtle Island Liberation Front appears to be part of the larger ecosystem of groups that the Trump administration is focusing on, with a far-left, anarchist, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist ideology.",
      "\"The individuals that were involved in this alleged plot appear to be a splinter group or an offshoot of the larger Turtle Island Liberation Front,\" he said. \"In other words, I believe that there are members of the Turtle Island Liberation Front that had nothing to do with this plot, and what we appear to be seeing is several individuals that have decided to escalate their activism to actual political violence.\"",
      "Kenney said the group appears to be small, but active in terms of digital and offline activism.",
      "\"This is a group that has an ideology, they have a set of political ideas that they follow, that they are trying to implement,\" he said. \"What they're trying to do here is bring attention to those ideas and their beliefs.\"",
      "Federal officials said one of the defendants, Carroll, 30, created a \"detailed bombing plot\" in November and provided it to a FBI source. She allegedly worked with Page, 32, to obtain and build the bombs, and to recruit participants for the plan. Essayli said Carroll's \"bomb plot was explicit,\" and included instructions for building the devices and targets across Orange County and Los Angeles.",
      "\"These bombs were to blow up at the same time, on midnight this New Year's Eve,\" said Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles Field Office. \"The plan stated that the IEDs would be complex pipe bombs. It included instructions on how to manufacture the bombs and contained guidance on how to avoid leaving evidence behind that can be traced back to them.\"",

    "story": [
      "A first-of-its-kind cold case investigation unit in Washington state has secured its first conviction after a woman pleaded guilty to the 2016 murder of an Indigenous artist.",
      "The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and People Cold Case Unit was established within the Washington attorney general's office in 2023, according to the office's website. The team works with law enforcement agencies to solve missing person and homicide cases involving people of Indigenous ancestry.",
      "The cold case unit was asked to investigate the murder of George David in 2024, the attorney general's office said in a news release. David, a member of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, was found dead in March 2016 at a friend's Port Angeles apartment. David, 65, was a renowned woodcarver and lived in Washington's Neah Bay, the attorney general's office said.",
      "Port Angeles police investigated the murder and designated Tina Marie Alcorn as their primary suspect, but there was not enough evidence to charge her. Alcorn was eventually extradited to Arkansas for violating probation on an unrelated felony theft conviction, according to CBS affiliate KIRO.",
      "When the the cold case unit began looking at the case in 2024, they were able to conduct additional investigation into some of the evidence collected in 2016, the attorney general's office said. That included additional DNA analysis.",
      "Alcorn was arrested in June and charged with murder. She pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, along with a special sentencing enhancement for being armed with a deadly weapon during the crime, the attorney general's office said on Monday. Alcorn was sentenced to more than 13 years in prison by a judge in Clallam County Superior Court.",
      "David's daughter Maria said in a statement that she is thankful to the attorney general's office and the cold case unit for solving the case.",
      "\"My dad was a master carver,\" she said. \"There are two half-finished puppets my dad was carving, that were to be used as a means of Indian Storytelling. But that never got to happen. I just have half-finished carvings, that never got to become puppets and tell their stories. Indian artwork is a way for us to tell our stories. And his stories can no longer be told, and we will never be able to see any of my dad's artwork again. Silver engraving, masks, totem poles, rattles, prints. It's all silent now.\"",
      "American Indian and Alaskan Native people \"experience violence at much higher rates than other populations,\" the cold case unit says on its website. Homicide is the sixth-leading cause of death for Indigenous women and girls, and the third-leading cause of death for Indigenous men. In Washington, about 5% of\u00a0unresolved cold case victims\u00a0are Indigenous, though less than 2% of the state's population is.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as fresh October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" she said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

The majority of the drugs came from a seizure carried out by the crew of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Munro. Earlier in December, the crew of the Munro worked with USCG air forces to disable a go-fast vessel that had more than 20,000 pounds of drugs aboard. It was the largest single-boat seizure in nearly 20 years.",

      "Morgan's property was secluded, with little chance of a neighbor seeing or hearing her on the back porch. And with that pillowcase over her head and the attacker's final words of warning ringing in her ears, Morgan had no way of knowing if he \u2014 or someone else \u2014 was watching her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I just listened to the stream and tried to be as peaceful and calm as I could.",
      "Forty minutes passed. Then, a sound in the distance struck terror in Morgan all over again.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear somebody walking up.",
      "Unable to see, she feared her attacker had returned to finish the job.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I hear them shuffling, walking and they hit the stairs. \u2026 And I knew they were at the top when he hit the first board and it creaked really loud.",
      "That's when Morgan heard a very familiar voice.g",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Oh honey, what happened?\"",
      "Morgan's grueling ordeal was finally over. And who would turn out to be her rescuer? Her ex-husband Rod Metzer.",
      "A HERO TO THE RESCUE?",
      "When Morgan's ex-husband Rod Metzer turned up at her house, he immediately called 911.",
      "911 DISPATCHER: Cherokee County 911.",
      "ROD METZER: Somebody \u2014 somebody broke in over here.",
      "ROD METZER: She was on the back porch. Uh, and \u2014 and the back door was wide open.",
      "ROD METZER: She was tied up with a hood over her head.",
      "As they waited for help to arrive, Rod tried to console Morgan. Their conversation heard on the 911 call.",
      "MORGAN METZER (911 call): Please don't leave, Rod.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to be right here.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Please.",
      "ROD METZER: I'm going to leave the door open, OK?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He came up and \u2014 and rescued her on the back porch.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Saved her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Saved her.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Her hero.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:\u00a0Absolutely.",
      "Sergeant Dakota Lyvers was a detective with the Cherokee County Sheriff's Department in 2021. He had a lot of questions. Exactly why had Rod gone to Morgan's home in the middle of the night?",
      "Rod moved out of Morgan's home and into his own apartment shortly after the divorce, said Lyvers.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was \u2026 getting ready for bed. He was brushing his teeth when he heard knocking on his window. Um, that knocking was accompanied by a voice in which he could only decipher the word \"Morgan\" was being said.",
      "Concerned, Rod said he tried calling Morgan, but she didn't answer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say he was thinking? I mean, someone knocks on his window in the early morning hours of New Year's Day.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He obviously went to the worst. Um, he thought that that something was, uh, gonna happen to Morgan or something might be happening to Morgan.",
      "Rod told investigators he'd gotten in his car and made the 12-minute drive over to his ex-wife's house. Despite being divorced, Rod said he was still looking out for Morgan. Their relationship stretched back nearly 20 years.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How old were you when you met Rod?",
      "Morgan Metzer: 14 years old.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was it love at first sight?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes, it was. It was \u2014 it was scary how fast it was.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He was 17 at that time.",
      "Kathy Metzer is Rod's mother.",
      "Kathy Metzer: We were on the way to a baseball game and he said, \"Mom, you're gonna meet Morgan tonight.\" And I said, \"Who's Morgan?\" \"That's my girlfriend.\" And I said, \"What?\" He said, \"Be nice.\" (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did Rod change at all when he was dating Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, yeah. \u2026 There was nothing that she could mention that she didn't get.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How did he treat you?",
      "Morgan Metzer:\u00a0 Amazing. \u2026 He called me \"princess.\" And so he literally treated me like that.",
      "No one was surprised when the couple married in 2009. Morgan was 21 years old.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Morgan was one of the most gorgeous brides I've ever seen in my life.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Weather was perfect. It was outside, so thank goodness for the weather.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was everything I dreamed of. My dad gave me everything I could want, you know. \u2026 It was just precious.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was marriage like in the very beginning?",
      "Morgan Metzer: It was just awesome. \u2026 It's just you two. \u2026 You're mourning the loss of your, like, wedding being over (laughs) and your honeymoon. And it's like, \"I wanna go again!\"",
      "Unfortunately, their newly wedded bliss would be short-lived. Eight months after the wedding, Rod's younger brother Kevin, who wished the couple \"endless years of love, health and happiness,\" at their wedding, lost his battle with leukemia at the age of 19.",
      "Kathy Metzer: It really hit Rod hard. I mean, it \u2014 I don't think he was ever the same after that. \u2026 He depended on Morgan at that point, more than he did anybody. I don't think he left her side for more than an hour or two.",
      "But the next year would bring some good news to celebrate.",
      "Morgan Metzer: We got pregnant with our son.",
      "Morgan says picking his name was easy.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Kevin always wanted to be an uncle. He always talked about it, how much fun he would have.",
      "Kathy Metzer: They named him Kevin after my Kevin, Rod's brother. (cries)",
      "But the family would suffer a second, and devastating, loss. Baby Kevin was born early, with a congenital heart defect. He lived just 18 days.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He actually died on his due date.",
      "Nikki Battiste: The loss of a child is unthinkable and I would imagine tough for you and Rod.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Very tough. \u2026 Don't really remember a lot of it. It's a big blur with all the emotions.",
      "So it seemed like a miracle when, just three months later, Morgan discovered she was pregnant again. Kathy remembers the moment Rod showed her the ultrasound picture.",
      "Kathy Metzer: He says, \"what do you see?\" I said, \"a baby.\" He said, \"No. Look, what do you see?\" And I just screamed at the top of my lungs, \"two babies,\" you know. (laughs)",
      "Nikki Battiste: Twins.",
      "Kathy Metzer: Twins. They were gonna have twins.",
      "Morgan gave birth to a healthy boy and girl in 2012. It should have been a happy time but not long after, the marriage began to change.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Probably about a year after they were born, which is right around the time that Rod lost his job, is when it started going down south from there.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did Rod do for work?",
      "Morgan Metzer: He, he had so many jobs. His main one, when he lost all of his money, was he was being a day trader for himself.",
      "Rod's job loss happened to come at the same time Morgan's career was starting to flourish.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I started my own interior design business and it took off. \u2026 I just didn't expect it to boom and blow up.",
      "Morgan's company, Shiplap and Sugar, became so successful she asked Stabasefski to join her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: She was saying, you know, like \"I need help, I'm overwhelmed.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you became business partners?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: Yeah. \u2026 Making money. \u2026 Working our tails off, doing what we love.",
      "Morgan says her professional success, and Rod's lack of it, made for a dangerous combination. She says he began to abuse her \u2014 both physically and mentally. She recalls one Labor Day weekend. She and Rod were celebrating on a boat with friends and had just returned to their cabin.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I guess we had gotten into an argument about something, \u2026 that's the first night he beat the \u2014 he beat me.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did you think, he hit me. I've gotta get out of here?",
      "Morgan Metzer: Yes. I had my dad come and get me.",
      "Shockingly, Morgan says Rod tried to convince her, and the people closest to her, that she was to blame for her injuries.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He convinced my parents that I was the one that did it.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did he say?",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You were just out of control. You \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn't keep your temper. You were just whaling all over the place.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod claimed she got hurt because he was forced to physically restrain her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I'm like, OK, well, maybe that's my fault. \u2026 And my friends stopped talking to me then because he had no marks on him. It was all me.",
      "Morgan says that's when a new phase in the marriage began, one in which she started to doubt her own reality because, she says, Rod was gaslighting her \u2014 making her think every conflict Rod instigated actually began with her.",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: I think she thought she was crazy. You know, you get programmed to think that you're crazy, like it's all in your head.",
      "Morgan says Rod even involved their children in his deception.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He pretended I pushed him down the stairs and he literally rolled down the stairs. You know, he actually got hurt and said to the kids, \"Look, Mommy pushed me downstairs. Can you believe that?\"",
      "Morgan says Rod sexually abused her as well, although she says it took a while for her to recognize what it was.",
      "Morgan Metzer: A lot of times he's very aggressive and wouldn't take the word no. And so now looking back on it, I guess he did sexually abuse me.",
      "Morgan filed for divorce in 2020.",
      "Nikki Battiste: When Morgan decided to \u2026 go through with the divorce, how was she handling it?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: You know, it was the first time I think I saw her have peace.",
      "The divorce was final in December and Morgan was ready to move on. But now, in the early morning hours of New Year's Day, it appeared Rod had come back into her life as her hero.",
      "CRITICAL CLUES IN THE INVESTIGATION",
      "Sergeant Lyvers and Sergeant Robert Haugh recall that when they first arrived at Morgan's house at 3 a.m. Rod's behavior had struck them as unusual.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: So, as we were walking up \u2026 Rodney was, um, seated in his car right here \u2026 with another deputy.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Did he say anything?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah, he did. \u2026 He asked, \"Hey man, are you the guy that we've been waiting on? And I said, \"uh, yes, sir, I am.\" And then he replied, \"do your f****** job.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I was taken aback. I really was.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: This guy just had found his wife bound, um, and beaten on the back porch. And you would think that my arrival to help find a resolution to this, uh, would be welcoming.",
      "Immediately, Morgan's appearance startled the investigators.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Her eye was swollen shut, black and blue. \u2026 She still had the, uh, zip tie around her one wrist. And I was shocked, and I had seen a lot in my career. And, uh, I was surprised that somebody would \u2014 would be so harsh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did it make you think?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Somebody was mad.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Absolutely. It was an emotional attack.",
      "Morgan was not only physically injured; investigators could tell she had suffered psychologically after the attacker left her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: She was in fear that she was \u2014 someone was still back here watching her and that they were gonna kill her if she moved. And so she laid here and waited.",
      "Morgan was outside for 40 minutes before Rod arrived, but initially she thought it was just half that.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Morgan believed it to be somewhere around 15 to 20 minutes, max. Um, that was her perception of time.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Interesting. I would've thought the opposite, that would've felt longer for her.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: I agree. \u2026 When their adrenaline's going, you know, people perceive things differently.",
      "The first thing Lyvers and Haugh did was separate Morgan, Rod and Morgan's father and brother \u2014 who came over after she called them. Then Lyvers recorded his conversation with Morgan inside the house.",
      "Safely out of earshot of her ex-husband, who was standing just outside, Morgan told investigators that she suspected her attacker was the man pretending to be her hero.",
      "MORGAN METZER: I just thought it was him.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: When you say \"him,\" you're talking about your ex-husband?",
      "MORGAN METZER: Mm-hmm.",
      "Morgan said she had no idea who her assailant was when the attack began, but then came one critical moment.",
      "Morgan Metzer: When he said \u2026 \"you're going to miss your husband,\" I said, \"no, don't hurt my husband. I love him very much.\" And I don't know what made me do that. But at that exact moment is when \u2026 the mood of the room changed. I knew I was going to live.",
      "And then there was another, even bigger clue, when her attacker lifted Morgan off the bed to place her outside.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's when I really knew it was him.",
      "Morgan remembered something from years earlier.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was pregnant with my kids, my twins. And sometimes you have to get help out of the bed. \u2026 The way he gently held me and got me out of bed, it was so familiar that I was like, this is him. I know it's 100% percent him.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I wasn't going to let him know that I knew it was him. Because if he did then he \u2014 I didn't know what he was going to do.",
      "She told them the attack had followed a chaotic week which began with very troubling news.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He thinks he's got pancreatic cancer.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He just called me \u2026 \u00a0and said, \"I've got pancreatic cancer.\" And so I rushed to go see him. \u2026 I said, \"you're the father of my children. \u2026 I'm here for you.\"",
      "Morgan Metzer: He showed me doctor's notes and whatnot.",
      "Rod had told no one else and Morgan explained that she'd been letting him stay at her house.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He'd been sleeping on my sofa because he had been really freaked out and upset obviously.",
      "Morgan told the investigators that Rod had spent the week trying to reconcile with her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He kept begging me to get back together with me. \u2026 Just constantly haggling me.",
      "But Morgan says she had no interest. By the morning of Dec. 31, she'd had enough. Feeling the pressure of being his sole emotional support, Morgan insisted Rod share his health news with his parents.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He said, \"no, absolutely not. I'm not telling anybody.\" And that's when I was like, \"OK, get out.\"",
      "Morgan says Rod spent the day texting her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You need to get back with me. I'll make enough money. You can quit your job right now.\"",
      "Fed up with it all, Morgan lied and told Rod she'd be sleeping elsewhere that New Year's Eve night.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"Staying at my parents' house tonight. I'm turning my phone off.\" Like, give me some space.",
      "As Morgan shared her suspicions with investigators, she didn't know if they would accept what she was telling them.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I've been mentally, emotionally, physically abused.",
      "Because Rod made her feel like she was to blame for years.",
      "Morgan Metzer: That's what he's built in my brain.",
      "But that all changed when Lyvers told her he believed her.",
      "Morgan Metzer: And I just melted. \u2026 He heard me. I have not been heard in years. Nobody listened. Nobody heard me and he heard me.",
      "Rachel Ashe: That started the investigation into Rodney Metzer.",
      "Rachel Ashe is the Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney for Cherokee County. She works exclusively on domestic violence cases. Parker, an emotional support dog, is often with her to comfort victims. Ashe says investigators were perplexed that Rod had come to Morgan's house that night after she'd told him she'd be at her parents' home.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Why did you even come here? Why didn't you go to her parents' house? Why didn't \u2014 why didn't you check with her parents?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He claimed it was just habit, normal.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"It's what I would do.\"",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you scratching your heads?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: Yeah.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: A little bit.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: We questioned him on it.",
      "Rod said that after hearing that knocking on his window, and someone saying Morgan's name, he tried phoning Morgan to warn her. Haugh wanted to check.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think that's what prompted, \"hey, where's your phone?\"",
      "Rod handed his cellphone to the investigators.",
      "Rachel Ashe: Gave them permission to look through his phone.",
      "And what they found came as a surprise.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was an Apple iPhone, and it had a hidden folder. \u2026 And in the hidden folder were images of Morgan \u2014 um, partially dressed.",
      "Rachel Ashe: A lot of photos of Morgan nude and those photos of Morgan nude, it was pretty apparent that she didn't know he was taking those photos of her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was quite alarmed.",
      "Investigators also discovered Rod had snapped pictures of Morgan's cellphone showing text messages between her and another man. They considered these and the photos of Morgan to be an invasion of privacy.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: You didn't have that permission. Y'all don't have that relationship. She's f****** baffled that you have that. That's stalkerish.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We knew we had to \u2026 get him in custody \u2026 while we started doing search warrants and started investigating \u2026 to prevent him from destroying evidence.",
      "ROD METZER: People make mistakes, man.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I think you made a lot of mistakes.",
      "SGT. ROBERT HAUGH: Big, big mistakes.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So you arrested him for having taken those photos secretly?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Stand up.",
      "ROD METZER: You're kidding me?",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: Nope, we're not kidding you. Stand up. This is not a joke. C'mon.",
      "But could investigators prove that Rod had attacked Morgan that night?",
      "ZIP TIES AND ALARMING INTERNET SEARCHES",
      "Morgan Metzer: Watched him get, uh, arrested, walk to the car, and be put in. It was kind of like, is this really happening?",
      "Nikki Battiste: Was any part of you sad?",
      "Morgan Metzer: No, not at the time. It was angry and just sore.",
      "Even as they booked Rod for taking those pictures of Morgan and her texts, Haugh and Lyvers had already developed a theory about why Rod might have attacked her.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I believe, he thought he was going to come in and \u2014 and rescue her and be the savior and, uh \u2014 and win her back.",
      "Investigators hoped home security cameras would support their theory. But they quickly learned that all the video from the time of the attack had been erased through the app on Morgan's phone that the assailant had used to unlock her back porch door when he left. Morgan's attacker took her phone with him. It was never recovered.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Were you ever able to retrieve those missing videos from the security company?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: No. \u2026 Once videos are deleted, they're deleted from their cloud.",
      "But since Morgan had a home security system, how did the attacker get in without setting off the alarm? It did not take long to figure out.",
      "Nikki Battiste: This is the window the attacker entered?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That's correct. Right here is the, uh \u2014 the window that we found the screen was actually removed.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That basement window \u2026 had an alarm sensor that was removed from the window and put together on the windowsill. So, if the window was to open, it would appear, you know, to the alarm system that the sensor is still making contact.",
      "Investigators believed Rod had disabled the sensor while he was staying at Morgan's house that week.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I was sleeping. It was in the middle of the night.",
      "Although the home security videos had been erased, there was other video from prior to the attack. The camera on Morgan's front porch caught Rod earlier that evening.",
      "Morgan Metzer: He had sent me a picture of a check\u2026. And he's like, \"it's underneath your front porch.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: It was for $56,000 and change.",
      "Morgan says the message Rod sent with the picture of the check made it seem like he was trying to make a grand gesture.",
      "Morgan Metzer: \"You should have all the money. You deserve everything,\" pretty much in a nutshell.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I think it was to get her to come back to the house that evening because \u2026 she told Rodney she was gonna be at her parents' house for New Year's.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Morgan returned to the house, retrieved it, and kind of made some sort of a \u2014 uh \u2014 of a gesture and she walked back into the house and put it on the kitchen countertop.",
      "Morgan's attacker took that check with him. It was never found.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you find out about Rod's finances?",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers:: That check would've bounced.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yeah, he was broke.",
      "The day after his arrest, investigators executed search warrants on Rod's car and his apartment. As soon as they walked through the door, they found a key piece of evidence.",
      "Rachel Ashe: They located this bag of zip ties in his apartment. And \u2026 a portion of a zip tie.",
      "Before arriving at her house, Morgan's attacker had pre-looped the zip ties he'd put on her wrists.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: He was working in the dark. He was handcuffing somebody. You never know how much fight that person's going to put up.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: One of the zip ties actually, um, was pretty unique because it had two, um \u2014 other zip ties that had been, uh, ratcheted onto it and then cut. And so basically what we were looking at was a \u2014 a zip tie that had two extra heads.",
      "Haugh and Lyvers needed to find out if that portion of a zip tie, essentially a tail, found in Rod's apartment, lined up with one of the extra heads on Morgan's restraints. They headed to their crime lab.",
      "Nikki Battiste: So these are the zip ties that were actually found on Morgan?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: Yes, they are.",
      "Melanie Thrasher is a crime scene technician.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: She was able to match the \u2014 this tail to one of the heads on the zip tie for Morgan's wrist.",
      "The striations on the tail found in Rod's apartment lined up exactly with those on Morgan's zip tie. A \"perfect match\" said Haugh.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What did you think when you saw this?",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: That we were going to be adding charges to his, uh, existing booking. \u2026 And we had our guy. \u2026 I would've never, you know, imagined, uh, having a piece of evidence like this.",
      "But the search warrant of Rod's apartment yielded even more. There was a book \u2014",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \"7 Ways to \u2014",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: \"To Be Her Hero.\"",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: \u2014 \"Be Her Hero,\" to \u2014 to win somebody back.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: That gave us the motive. \u2026 It added to that motive.",
      "Investigators examined Rod's browser history.",
      "Rachel Ashe:\u00a0 The searches \u2026 were very disturbing.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He was researching \"how to change your voice.\"",
      "Rachel Ashe: \"How long to choke somebody unconscious.\"",
      "The searches also included \"How to crack an iPhone password,\" \"How to get sympathy from your ex\" and one that was especially appalling.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He Google searched \u2026 \"cancer diagnosis letters.\"",
      "Investigators searched Rod's outgoing emails. There they found Rod had set up a fake email account to create the pancreatic cancer diagnosis letter he'd shown Morgan. And there was more.",
      "Rachel Ashe: He had created a bill for a doctor's office to show that he was being treated for pancreatic cancer. \u2026 All of this in order to convince Morgan that he had pancreatic cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: He wasn't sick at all?",
      "Rachel Ashe: No. \u2026 He did not have cancer.",
      "Nikki Battiste: Do you think that he faked the cancer diagnosis as a way to try to get you back or as a way to get access to your house 'cause he had this plan?",
      "Morgan Metzer: I think it was to get me back. It might have been both.",
      "On Jan. 3, two days after the attack, Lyvers and Sergeant Tom Harris interviewed Rod. They talked to him about his health.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: You said you're diabetic",
      "ROD METZER: Yes.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: What other kind of health issues do you have?",
      "ROD METZER: Nothing as far as I know of yet.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: I thought you had cancer.",
      "Lyvers confronted Rod about the cancer diagnosis he'd faked to Morgan.",
      "SGT. DAKOTA LYVERS: How did you tell her that \u2026 this \u2014 this cancer thing?",

      "Harris told Morgan they'd watched the home security video of Rod arriving at her house after her attack. He rang the front doorbell but when there was no response, headed around to the back.",
      "SGT. TOM HARRIS: I thought it was kind of interesting that he called out your name as he's walking around the side of your house.",
      "MORGAN METZER: Yes. \u2026 Like, why would you think I was outside.",
      "Nikki Battiste: What was your reaction when you learned Rod had been arrested for violently attacking Morgan?",
      "Kathy Metzer: Oh, that \u2014 that absolutely threw me under the ground. \u2026 There had to be a mistake. Rod wasn't capable of that.",
      "Two days after Rod was charged he talked to his mom Kathy on the phone.",
      "ROD METZER (jail phone call): Why is she doing this to me? She knows it wasn't me.",
      "But the evidence kept mounting. When investigators recovered those zip ties from Rod's apartment, the bag they came in was found as well.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: I brought up a \u2014 a, uh, my Lowe's app on my phone and scanned the UPC code and the UPC code came back that they were in fact sold at Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: The sheriff's office then went to the two Lowe's that we have here in Cherokee County. \u2026 And they started searching for transactions.",
      "It didn't take long. Rod Metzer had purchased those zip ties on Dec. 30 \u2014 about 36 hours before the attack; easy to find because he paid with his debit card. Investigators obtained the security video from Lowe's.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This was during COVID and this was during a period where everybody was wearing a mask, except for Rodney Metzer. So the surveillance images and the videos that were recovered from Lowe's of him purchasing those zip ties \u2026 his face is right there in the camera.",
      "Next came the security video from Rod's apartment building.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: There's actually one inside the, uh \u2014 the breezeway there, which leads to Rodney's apartment specifically.",
      "Lyvers says there was no video of Rod leaving after he said someone knocked on his window.",
      "Sgt. Dakota Lyvers: What we do see is after the time of the incident that Morgan was attacked, Rodney come in, disheveled, in a hurry.",
      "Just four minutes later, Rod is caught on camera again, leaving the building, wearing completely different clothes and sneakers, and carrying a plastic bag. The time stamp was 1:24 a.m.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: We never found that bag in his car when we did the search warrant.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We just don't know where that went.",
      "Investigators can't know for sure what was in that bag but believe it had evidence Rod discarded on his drive back to Morgan's house. The attacker's mask was never found. But Deputy Chief Assistant District Attorney Rachel Ashe says they had more than enough to prove Rod was guilty.",
      "Rachel Ashe: This is a prosecutor's dream to put up because the evidence in this case was overwhelming, overwhelming.",
      "But Ashe says she wanted to offer Morgan an opportunity for quicker closure than a trial would bring in the form of a plea deal for Rod.",
      "Rachel Ashe: We went through the pros and cons of letting him plead guilty, letting him accept responsibility. \u2026 We agreed, um, we should try. He took it quickly.",
      "On Aug. 4, 2021, Rod pleaded guilty to a total of 14 counts related to Morgan's attack and the photos found on his phone.",
      "Sgt. Robert Haugh: He agreed to serve 25 years on a 70-year sentence. So, when he gets out in 25 years, he'll serve another 45 years of probation.",
      "Nikki Battiste: I think you even described it as like a death.",
      "Morgan Metzer: It is a death. I've lost my husband. He's dead to me.",
      "At Rod's sentencing, Morgan delivered a victim impact statement several pages long.",
      "Morgan Metzer: Once I got started, it just started pouring outta me.",
      "There were no cameras in the courtroom. \"48 Hours\" asked Morgan to read her statement. Here's a portion of it.",
      "Morgan Metzer (reading her victim impact statement): Rod, not only will this statement be to my attacker, but it'll also be my last words to whom I thought was the love of my life. \u2026 The last four years being married to you was like living with a monster that constantly tried to break me down and fence me in. \u2026 It was a blessing in disguise. \u2026 I can now walk with the confidence knowing the pain you have given me is turned into power.",
      "Morgan Metzer: I walked off that stand with a thousand pounds off of my shoulders. It felt so good. It felt empowering. And I got the last word.",
      "Nikki Battiste: How was it to listen to your best friend read this incredibly powerful statement?",
      "Nichole Stabasefski: It was awesome because she did not cry. \u2026 Her voice did not shake \u2026 and she said everything she needed to say, and when she was done, she was done.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/raskin-bill-require-white-house-renovation-plans-review/",
    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 07:18:59 -0500",
    "summary": "Rep. Jamie Raskin wants to see White House construction like President Trump's ballroom project subjected to the same scrutiny as other federal projects.",
    "story": [
      "Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland plans to introduce legislation Tuesday that would subject White House renovations like President Trump's ballroom project to the same reviews as other federal projects. Currently, the White House is exempt from certain oversight under the National Historic Preservation Act.",
      "Raskin's bill, called the \"People's White House Historic Preservation Act,\" would require White House renovations to undergo a so-called \"Section 106 review,\" a pre-ground breaking assessment that addresses the impact of renovations on historic buildings and allows the public to weigh in.",
      "The legislation comes three months after construction crews began work on a privately-financed, 90,000-square-foot ballroom addition that will cost about $300 million. A construction crane hangs over the site where the East Wing once stood. It was demolished in late October, even though President Trump had previously said the new construction would be \"near it but not touching it \u2014 and pays total respect to the existing building.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has reveled in how easy it's been to fast track the project. In October, Mr. Trump recounted being told, \"Sir, this is the White House, you're the president of the United States, you can do anything you want.\"",
      "\"It's kings who treat public property as private property,\" Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, told CBS News in a phone interview. \"It's not his house; it's our house. And if there is going to be construction and renovation expansion or changes, that should go through a regular public process.\"",
      "The White House asserts Mr. Trump has \"full legal authority to modernize, renovate, and beautify the White House.\"",
      "Aside from renderings Mr. Trump has shown at various events, ballroom schematics have faced little formal scrutiny \u2014 but that may soon change.",
      "In a court filing late Monday, the administration said consultations \"will soon be underway\" with the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, two independent advisory boards overseeing federal projects in the Washington area. The administration added that it was not legally bound to confer with either board and that above-ground ballroom construction would begin in April at the earliest.",
      "Raskin's bill would mandate consultations with both commissions prior to ground breaking.",
      "At its monthly meeting in early December, NCPC chairman Will Scharf, who is also a White House staffer, said the White House was not required to submit demolition plans because the commission only oversees new construction.",
      "\"We simply do not have jurisdiction over demolition and site preparation work; that what we're really concerned about here is visible architecture \u2014 is above-ground build,\" Scharf said, adding that NCPC would play a \"constructive role\" when the time comes.",
      "Raskin argues that leveling the East Wing without a review process was a violation of destruction of federal property laws, though he acknowledges the president cannot be prosecuted under those statutes.",
      "Currently, Raskin's legislation has 27 Democratic co-sponsors. With Republicans in control of the House, the measure faces long odds.",
      "\"I hope that there are enough champions of the public-private distinction in the Republican caucus that we can bring some over,\" Raskin said.",
      "Last week, National Trust for Historic Preservation filed a lawsuit seeking to halt ballroom construction. \"No president is legally allowed to tear down portions of the White House without any review whatsoever \u2014 not President Trump, not President Biden, not anyone else,\" the Trust's suit said. \"And no president is legally allowed to construct a ballroom on public property without giving the public the opportunity to weigh in.\"",
      "In response, the administration said the Trust's complaint was moot \"because the demolition has already occurred and cannot be undone.\"",
      "An initial hearing in the case is scheduled for Tuesday afternoon in Washington.",
      "Jennifer  Jacobs and \n                                                  \n                                  Jacob  Rosen\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Hotels and lodges will welcome back visitors to the Grand Canyon's South Rim after the national park\u00a0halted overnight stays for more than a week because of multiple breaks in a water pipeline, the park said Monday.",
      "Starting Wednesday, visitors can stay overnight at El Tovar, Bright Angel Lodge, Maswik Lodge, Delaware North's Yavapai Lodge and Trailer Village.",
      "Some campground water spigots will remain off, and fire restrictions at the South Rim will continue. Park officials are still encouraging visitors and residents to take shorter showers, wash only full loads of laundry and turn off the faucet when brushing teeth. Hikers should bring or treat water if needed, park officials said.",
      "Park crews finished complex repairs to the Transcanyon Waterline last week and resumed pumping water without identifying any new breaks, the park said, adding that it will keep operating under enhanced water restrictions until the water storage tanks have adequate capacity to return to routine water conservation practices.",
      "The park first took steps to conserve water earlier this month by pausing overnight stays to repair breaks in the decades-old pipeline that delivers water to visitors, residents and staff. Most Grand Canyon visitors spend their time at the South Rim, with about 41,000 of them using overnight lodging last December.",
      "It's the second time the park has halted overnight stays as it repairs the park's primary pipeline that frequently breaks. Last August, park officials took unprecedented action and imposed water restrictions that forced the sudden shutdown of overnight hotel stays during one of the busiest times of the year.",
      "Maintenance of the 12.5-mile-long waterline has long been a priority for the park. It's in the midst of a $208 million rehabilitation of the pipeline and upgrades to the associated water delivery system, which began in 2023. The waterline was built in the late 1960s, the park notes.",

Multiple sources told CBS News that the couple's daughter Romy Reiner was the one who found them. Two sources familiar with the incident told CBS News the couple were found with multiple stab wounds.",
      "\"Our hearts go out to the family and friends of the Reiners, a tragic incident,\" McDonnell said at a news conference.",
      "The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement that police responded to the home Sunday at around 3:40 p.m. local time. The police didn't provide details about what led investigators to suspect Nick Reiner in the deaths, saying only that the investigation revealed he was allegedly responsible. Reiner was located and arrested at approximately 9:15 p.m. Sunday.",
      "Two sources who attended a party Saturday night where Rob and Nick Reiner were also present told CBS News on Monday that a brief but loud argument between the two took place.",
      "Rob Reiner was 78 and Michele Singer Reiner was 68. They married in 1989 and had three children.",
      "Nick Reiner was credited as a writer for the movie \"Being Charlie,\" which was directed by his father and debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2015. The two also promoted the movie together.",
      "The film, which told the story of a teenager struggling with drug addiction and rehab, was \"loosely based on things Nick went through and his relationship to me and his mother,\" Rob Reiner said in a 2016\u00a0AOL interview alongside his son. \"It was intense. It was difficult at times.\"",
      "\"I wasn't really that shy about including some of the bad stuff I did,\" Nick Reiner said during the joint interview, \"because a lot of people do things that are pretty unsavory when they're going through that, but in terms of making it a narrative, of course it's not my life.\" He also said, \"I think I can relate to it of course, and I hope other people can relate to it.\"",
      "Nick Reiner told People magazine in an interview promoting the movie's 2016 release that the film also drew from his experience living on the streets when he didn't want to go to rehab.",
      "Rob Reiner was known for his work on such movies as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally...\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\" He rose to fame with his role in the iconic 1970s CBS sitcom \"All in the Family.\"",
      "The couple's deaths sent shockwaves across the country, with reactions pouring in from Hollywood stars and politicians.",
      "Actor and television host Jerry O'Connell, who was one of the young co-stars in Reiner's 1986 movie \"Stand By Me,\" described Reiner's death as \"surreal\" in an\u00a0interview Monday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. ... It's just a sad, shocking day.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden expressed condolences from him and former first lady Jill Biden on social media to those whose lives were touched by the Reiners.",
      "\"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come,\" Biden said.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and former first lady Michelle Obama were heartbroken by the deaths.",
      "\"Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen,\" the former president said on social media. \"But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people\u2014and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired. We send our deepest condolences to all who loved them.\"",

    "summary": "Anthony Geary, who played Luke Spencer on the long-running soap opera \"General Hospital,\" has died.",
    "story": [
      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Anthony Geary, whose portrayal of Luke Spencer helped define General Hospital and daytime television,\" ABC said in a statement confirming his death.",
      "Geary died Sunday in Amsterdam of complications from a surgical procedure three days prior.",
      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",
      "In addition to his role as Luke, Geary had numerous TV and stage credits, including stints on other soaps: \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"Bright Promise.\" Geary played Luke on and off until 2015, though he returned for a cameo in 2017.",
      "He lived a quiet life with husband Claudio Gama in Amsterdam.",
      "In a 1993 interview, Geary spoke of the many highs and lows of playing Luke.",
      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump took to social media on Monday to disparage the political views of actor and director Rob Reiner a day after Reiner and his wife Michele were found dead in their Los Angeles home in what police are calling an apparent homicide. The president's comments were quickly condemned by a number of lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Nick Reiner, the couple's 32-year-old son, has been arrested\u00a0for murder and is now being held without bail, police said Monday.",
      "Although there is no evidence that has been made public that connects Reiner's death to his political views, the president linked the director's killing with what he called his \"TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.\"",
      "\"A very sad thing happened last night in Hollywood,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Rob Reiner, a tortured and struggling, but once very talented movie director and comedy star, has passed away, together with his wife, Michele, reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, sometimes referred to as TDS.\"",
      "Reiner was a longtime activist and prolific Democratic fundraiser who\u00a0 gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates and causes over the course of his life. And he was also a longtime critic of Mr. Trump, referring to him during his first term as \"mentally unfit\" and \"unqualified\" to be president.",
      "Mr. Trump said of Reiner, \"He was known to have driven people CRAZY by his raging obsession of President Donald J. Trump, with his obvious paranoia reaching new heights as the Trump Administration surpassed all goals and expectations of greatness, and with the Golden Age of America upon us, perhaps like never before.\" His post concluded, \"May Rob and Michele rest in peace!\"",
      "An official White House account reposted the president's social media post on X.",
      "A reporter asked the president later Monday if he stands by his post. Mr. Trump did not apologize.",
      "\"Well, I wasn't a fan of his at all,\" the president said. \"He was a deranged person, as fall as Trump was concerned,\" he said, saying Reiner was \"one of the people behind\" the \"Russia hoax.\" \"I think he hurt himself career-wise. Became like a deranged person. Trump derangement syndrome. So I was not a fan of Rob Reiner in any way, shape or form. I thought he was very bad for our country.\"",
      "The president's post drew immediate reactions on social media and from lawmakers of both parties.",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana told reporters that Mr. Trump \"should've said nothing.\"",
      "\"I think when the president says these sorts of things, it detracts from his policy achievements and his agenda,\" Kennedy said.",
      "He continued: \"And just speaking personally, when someone is murdered or assassinated, as happened to Mr. Kirk, we should show him and his family respect,\" referring to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "Jenna Ellis, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, condemned\u00a0the president's message in a post on X.",
      "\"A man and his wife were murdered last night,\" she wrote. \"This is NOT the appropriate response. The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk's death. This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.\" In 2023, Ellis\u00a0pleaded guilty\u00a0in Georgia to a felony charge of aiding and abetting false statements and writing over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",
      "Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky\u00a0wrote on X, \"Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they're afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it.\"",
      "Sen. Alex Padilla, a Democrat from California, told CBS News, \"Donald Trump's tirade, just hours after Rob and Michele Reiner's tragic murder, is disgusting and deranged. No matter your politics, this tragedy should be mourned and the violence condemned, not exploited.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey of Maryland, a former federal prosecutor, told CBS News, \"Trump's statement is sick and dangerous because he suggests the Reiners' killings were because they were vocal critics of the Trump administration.\" He also criticized the president's comments as divisive, adding, \"This rhetoric divides the country, paints targets on private citizens and risks inciting political violence. A president should lower the temperature, not inflame it.\"",
      "Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice of Oklahoma wrote on X, \"A father and mother were murdered at the hands of their troubled son. We should be lifting the family up in prayer, not making this about politics.\"",
      "And Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who's been targeted by Mr. Trump for pressing the government to release files related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, noted in response to the president's post that the Reiners' son \"reportedly had drug addiction and other issues, and their remaining children are left in serious mourning and heartbreak.\"",
      "\"This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,\" Greene continued. \"Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It's incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.\"",

      "New York Attorney General Letitia James accused UPS of violating labor laws by using unlawful timekeeping practices to underpay seasonal help.",
      "\"UPS built its holiday business on the backs of workers who were not paid for their time and labor,\" James\u00a0said in a statement announcing the charges. \"UPS's seasonal employees work brutal hours in the cold to deliver the holiday packages families across the country count on. Instead of compensating these workers fairly for their labor, UPS has played the Grinch.\"",
      "UPS denied the allegations that it intentionally underpaid workers.",
      "\"We offer industry-leading pay and benefits to our more than 26,000 employees in New York, and we remain committed to following all applicable laws,\" the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "James said Monday that Atlanta-based UPS, which employs nearly 500,000 people worldwide and generated more than $90 billion in revenue last year, stole wages from seasonal workers, including \"Driver Helpers\" and \"Seasonal Support Drivers\" who assist full-time staff with package delivery around the holidays.",
      "UPS allegedly failed to pay seasonal workers for all of the hours they worked, according to the civil lawsuit, which was filed in New York state court. For example, UPS delayed worker clock-ins until they scanned in a package or made a delivery, even if they had been scheduled to start working hours earlier, the complaint alleges. UPS also automatically deducted 30-minute meal breaks regardless of whether workers took them, according to the lawsuit.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 16:02:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Scottie Scheffler topped the ballot against Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and Ben Griffin, though the PGA Tour did not release what percentage of the votes Scheffler received.",
    "story": [
      "Scottie Scheffler earned another comparison with Tiger Woods on Monday, joining him as the only players to win PGA Tour player of the year at least four times in a row.",
      "Scheffler made an easy case to pick up another Jack Nicklaus Award. His tour-leading six victories were twice as many as anyone else and included two majors, the\u00a0PGA Championship\u00a0and the British Open, to leave him on the cusp of a career Grand Slam.",
      "He became the first player since Woods in 2000 to lead the PGA Tour with the lowest scoring average in each of the four rounds and had 15 consecutive tournaments in the top 10 to end his remarkable season.",
      "\"I think overall the thing that I'm most proud of when I look at the last couple years is just consistency,\" Scheffler said on a conference call. \"It's not very easy to just show up and finish in the top 10 each week. I think that's something that's very difficult to do and something I'm very proud of, bringing the intensity that I need to in these tournaments and being prepared as I need to in order to perform well week in and week out.\"",
      "Scheffler was on the ballot with Rory McIlroy, Tommy Fleetwood and Ben Griffin. The award is a vote of the players, though the PGA Tour did not release what percentage of the votes Scheffler received or how many players voted.",
      "Woods is an 11-time winner of the award and won five straight times from 1999 through 2003.",
      "McIlroy had a big year in his own right, nothing grander than his\u00a0playoff victory in the Masters for the final leg of the career Grand Slam and a green jacket he had been pursuing for 15 years. He also added titles at Pebble Beach and The Players Championship.",
      "Scheffler, however, has been putting on a master class of consistency since breaking through with his first PGA Tour title in 2022. Along with 19 victories in his last 80 events on the PGA Tour \u2014 that doesn't include his\u00a0Olympic gold medal last year in Paris \u2014 Scheffler has finished among the top three in just over 46% of his PGA Tour starts.",
      "This season alone, Scheffler led the PGA Tour in 17 statistical categories, ranging from his accuracy from tee-to-green, how often he followed a bogey with a birdie or better (36%) and official earnings, which this year topped $27 million.",
      "And he effectively gave McIlroy and everyone else a head start. Scheffler sliced his right hand during Christmas last year while using a wine glass to cut ravioli. He missed nearly two months and didn't really find his groove until a week before the Masters, when he was runner-up in Houston.",
      "That began an astonishing stretch in which Scheffler didn't finish worse than a tie for eighth the rest of the year. He played his final six PGA Tour events without a round over par, and he had a stretch of 21 consecutive rounds in the 60s.",
      "He also won his hometown CJ Cup Byron Nelson in the Dallas area by matching the PGA Tour record for 72 holes at 253, an eight-shot victory.",
      "\"Yeah, I definitely didn't start off the way I intended to start off,\" Scheffler said. \"I missed the first couple weeks of the season but did a good job of bouncing back from that. I started to play some pretty good golf in May.\"",

      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",

    "story": [
      "The father and son suspects in the terror attack on Jewish people gathered for a Hanukkah event in Bondi Beach, Australia, spent most of November in the Philippines, police said Tuesday. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said, meanwhile, that the attack was \"motivated by ISIS ideology.\"",
      "New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went between Nov. 1 and 28. The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said Sajid Akram, 50, who was killed during the attack, and his 24-year-old son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, had listed the southern city of Davao as their final destination on the trip.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC reported the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Asian nation, citing security sources.",
      "\"People have traveled and networked amongst these groups, but very, very rarely,\" Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News. \"And this is often overblown.\"",
      "The Philippines' history with Islamist insurgency",
      "Islamist separatists have operated in the southern Philippines for decades \u2014 it's \"an insurgency which is almost 100 years in the making,\" according to Smith.",
      "He said two longstanding militant groups in the region \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the region.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region as well, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the region.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Authorities also revealed that gunmen had recently returned from the Philippines, where they traveled to an area known as a hotbed for terrorist groups.",
      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where Australian public broadcaster ABC said he had regained consciousness.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",
      "Suspected gunmen spent most of November in the Philippines",
      "Both men traveled to the Philippines in November, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters on Tuesday, adding that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went.",
      "The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said both Sajid Akram and his son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, spent most of November \u2014 from the 1st until the 28th \u2014   in the Philippines, and listing the city of Davao as their final destination.",
      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more. Always. I'm asking myself every day, 'what can I do better? How can I do better?' And I'm trying to do it. And I do expect the Australian government to do better.\"",
      "Former Australian leader says there are no easy answers",
      "Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CBS News on Tuesday that the national government undoubtedly had some very big questions to answer, but he stressed that intelligence gathering \u2014 for all nations \u2014 is an imperfect science.",
      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places.

    "summary": "A missing woman's phone has been found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
    "story": [
      "A missing woman's phone was found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness over the weekend, more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
      "An independent search party organized by Celine Cremer's friends and family found her phone on Saturday at a waterfall, Tasmania Police said in a statement. It was the first sign of Cremer ever located in the area where she went missing, aside from her car, which investigators discovered 10 days after the last confirmed sighting of her in Waratah, a town in the Australian island state of Tasmania.",
      "Tasmania Police said the phone will undergo further forensic examination and that they will now formally join the independent search for Cremer.",
      "Cremer, a Belgian woman, was last seen on June 17, 2023, in Waratah, according to police. Investigators believe that Cremer drove to Philosopher Falls, a waterfall surrounded by dense rainforest, and intended to set out for a short walk through the area.",
      "\"Unfortunately, she did not return,\" Tasmania Police inspector Andrew Hanson said in a statement.",
      "Her friends reported her disappearance to Tasmania Police on June 26, 2023, and the original search effort began the next day, police said.",
      "By then, the area had already experienced an intense spell of winter weather, including subzero temperatures, snow and rainfall. According to Hanson, medical experts at the time advised police that Cremer could not have survived so many days in the wilderness under those conditions.",
      "The initial search continued for two weeks, with no clues as to where Cremer might be, and follow-up searches over the years ended similarly. The recent discovery of Cremer's phone suggests that she may have veered off course during her walk around Philosopher Falls and lost her way.",
      "\"The phone was found in an area that has been extensively searched previously and phone data, as well as the location it was found, supports our theory that Celine may have, using an app on her phone, elected to leave the Philosopher Falls track to take more a direct route back to her car as daylight faded,\" said Hanson, adding: \"We suspect she dropped her phone and continued without it, becoming disoriented in dense terrain.\"",
      "A bout of harsh winter weather over the weekend postponed further search efforts, according to Tasmania Police, but Hanson said they planned to dispatch officers to the area as soon as those conditions cleared up.",
      "Police said that while they were not leading or coordinating the search that led to the phone's discovery, they \"had been supporting the effort by sharing information and advice about what to do should anything be discovered.\"",
      "The independent group of searchers included Cremer's friends and the adventure filmmaker Rob Parsons, who has posted videos of his own private attempts to search for Cremer on YouTube. He described the moment Cremer's phone was discovered in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "\"I don't think there was a dry eye in the area,\" Parsons told the news organization. \"Everyone was so emotional. Everything was building up to this point where her friends could be here for the discovery. It felt like it was meant to be.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump seeks a vast sum in damages from the U.K. public broadcaster for alleged defamation and unfair trade practice, BBC indicates it won't settle without a fight.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The BBC said Tuesday that it would defend itself in court after President Trump sued the British public broadcaster for defamation and violating Florida state practices law in relation to a documentary that edited together separate parts of his Jan. 6, 2021 speech in Washington.",
      "Mr. Trump is seeking $10 billion in damages with his lawsuit, filed Monday in the Southern District of Florida.",
      "In its statement, the BBC said it would \"be defending this case,\" but would not be commenting further on the ongoing legal proceedings.",
      "In his complaint, Mr. Trump's attorneys accuse the BBC of publishing \"a false, defamatory, deceptive, disparaging, inflammatory, and malicious depiction\" of him in the BBC documentary that aired in the U.K. a week before the 2024 election.",
      "The lawsuit claims the BBC, \"intentionally and maliciously sought to fully mislead its viewers\" by \"splicing together\" two clips from the same speech Mr. Trump gave to supporters in Washington before rioters overran the Capitol building. The two portions of the speech that were stuck together in the documentary were actually delivered by Mr. Trump nearly an hour apart, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "The complaint accuses the BBC of violating the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act, \"by engaging in unfair methods of competition, unconscionable acts or practices and/or unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had previously threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion unless it retracted the documentary, issued an apology, and \"appropriately\" compensated him.",
      "In November, the BBC issued an apology and published a retraction, but said in a statement that it \"strongly disagree[s] that there's a basis for a deflation claim.\"",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in November. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "BBC Director-General Tim Davie and the network's head of news Deborah Turness both resigned over the controversy.",
      "Mark Stephens, a U.K.-based international media lawyer, told CBS News that Mr. Trump's lawsuit \"is unfortunately ill founded and almost bound to fail.\"",
      "\"The President's case, all things being equal, should be thrown out of court at a summary dismissal,\" he said.",
      "Stephens said Mr. Trump's legal team, even if they won their suit against the BBC, would not get a $10 billion settlement.",
      "\"The BBC is a very much a hand-to-mouth kind of organization. It doesn't have profits. It doesn't have shareholders. So literally any money is going to come from the British taxpayers, and I think they'll feel pretty badly about paying President Trump for a court case of this kind,\" Stephens said.",
      "The U.K. has \"a law which essentially does not recognize what we call 'punitive damages' \u2014 damages that intend to punish,\" Stephens said. \"In the U.K., the maximum compensatory damages he would be entitled to is $300,000 U.S. dollars. So even if he got, say, a million or $2 million at court, the British courts would only enforce $300,000.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a \"very workable\" peace plan to end the war in Ukraine could be presented to Russia within days.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a peace deal to end his country's nearly four-year war with Russia are \"very workable\" and could be finalized within days, after which American envoys would present them to the Kremlin before further possible meetings in the United States next weekend.",
      "Zelenskyy warned late Monday that a draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin earlier in the day had not resolved some key issues, notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by invading Russian forces.",
      "U.S-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.",
      "If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"We want peace - we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\"",
      "American officials on Monday said that there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. President Trump said, \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, however.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either.",
      "\"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskyy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a 'free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a 'free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The land issue remains one of the most difficult obstacles to a comprehensive agreement.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense. Kyiv would seek enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons if diplomacy collapses, he said.",
      "Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"We are at a major moment in this war. The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war,\" he said at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.",
      "Zelenskyy was also positive about the talks.",
      "\"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" he said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking at the launch of the International Claims Commission for Ukraine in The Hague Tuesday, Zelenskyy added: \"As long as our people remain in Russian captivity and until the Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are brought home, sanctions must limit Russia, until it shows respect for peaceful for peaceful life and the rights of its neighbors. And of course, of course, every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them.\"",

      "Kwang Kyung Yoo, 51, sat with his head bowed as Justice Ian Harrison said he would never be eligible for parole.",
      "The former instructor, who was called Master Lion by his students, did not look at the victims' family as they cried in court, 9News Australia reported. He held a Bible stuffed with notes during the sentencing, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.",
      "Harrison said Yoo has been motivated by the jealousy he felt for the family's financial success.",
      "\"I'm satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of these offenses is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of a life sentence,\" Harrison told the New South Wales Supreme Court.",
      "Harrison said Yoo had no reason to murder the boy or his parents in February last year.",
      "\"These killings were horrific and violent acts, senselessly cruel and cynical, perpetrated without a trace of human compassion or consideration for the dignity of the Cho family,\" Harrison said, according to news.au.",
      "State law prevents child victims of crime from being identified, so the boy's parents also can't be named.",
      "Yoo and his victims were all born in South Korea.",
      "Yoo had pleaded guilty to the three murders at an earlier court appearance. He had no prior criminal record.",
      "Yoo had strangled the boy and his 41-year-old mom in his Lion's Taekwondo and Martial Arts Academy in western Sydney. He owed tens of thousands of dollars at the time and was behind in rent on the academy.",
      "He took the mother's Apple watch and drove her luxury BMW car to the family home where he stabbed the boy's 39-year-old father to death.",
      "Yoo was injured in the struggle in the home and drove himself to a hospital where he told medical staff he had been attacked in a supermarket car park. Police arrested him at the hospital.",
      "After his arrest, Yoo could not explain how he intended to get the family's money and later detailed his remorse.",
      "While the crimes were planned \u2014 with Yoo surveilling the family's home beforehand \u2014 he made no attempt to conceal his crimes from the CCTV cameras in his academy or try to conceal the bodies.",
      "The judge heard Yoo had lied about qualifying for the 2000 Olympics, owning a Lamborghini and living in Sydney's wealthy suburbs, 9News Australia reported. He would send emails to himself, pretending to be important people, in order to impress his wife, the outlet reported.",
      "Harrison noted that Yoo had told a psychologist his lies became bigger and bigger as his wife and students asked more questions.",
      "\"I wanted to give her hope,\" he told his psychiatrist, according to the Sydney Morning Herald. \"However, over time it became bigger and bigger and didn't stop. She was so happy.\"",
      "The judge noted Yoo had been burdened since childhood with unrealistic expectations from his parents and South Korean culture about the level of success he needed to achieve.",
      "Yoo was handed a box of tissues as the judge described his deep remorse for the hurt and pain that he had caused.",
      "In a letter to the judge, Yoo said he was \"held captive by sin\" and that he wanted to give himself to Jesus Christ.",
      "\"I wish I could turn back time so this didn't happen,\" Yoo wrote. \"I pray every day for the people I have hurt.\"",
      "Yoo's lawyers had argued that he should be given a minimum nonparole period rather than a life sentence without possibility of release. The maximum penalty for someone convicted of murder in New South Wales is life imprisonment, with a standard nonparole period of 20 years for the murder of an adult and 25 years for the murder of a child.",

    "story": [
      "Two suspected gunmen accused of killing 15 people and injuring dozens during a Hanukkah celebration in Australia have been identified as a father and a son, authorities said. The younger man was reportedly investigated years ago over suspected links to an ISIS cell in Sydney, and Australian officials confirmed Tuesday afternoon local time that two homemade ISIS flags were discovered in a vehicle registered to him.",
      "The shooting was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett said.",
      "The 50-year-old father, identified by police as Sajid Akram, was shot and killed by police, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the 24-year-old son remained hospitalized in a coma.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon has said, without going into further details.",
      "The 24-year-old suspect was identified as Naveed Akram, according to U.S. intelligence officials briefed on the investigation. CBS News has also reviewed Naveed Akram's New South Wales driver's license. Authorities said Sunday they had identified the father as a licensed gun owner.",
      "The officials had told CBS News that Naveed Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from. At the news conference on Tuesday local time, Lanyon also confirmed reports that the two alleged gunmen traveled to the Philippines last month. The exact location and purpose of the trip are under investigation, he said.",
      "Lanyon has said investigators recovered six of the suspect's licensed firearms at the scene. He initially said the older suspect had had a gun license for about 10 years, but confirmed Tuesday that the application lapsed in 2016. However, a second license was applied for in 2020 and eventually issued in 2023, meaning the older suspect was licensed appropriately at the time of the shooting, according to the police commissioner.",
      "The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon has said.",
      "In addition to two homemade ISIS flags found in Naveed Akram's vehicle, improvised explosive devices were also recovered, police said Tuesday.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" Lanyon said.",
      "Prime Minister Albanese confirmed that the younger suspect had been under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Agency (ASIO), the country's primary spy agency, for about six months during 2019.",
      "According to public broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corp., ASIO looked into the son's possible ties to a cell of the ISIS terrorist organization in Sydney. Albanese didn't go into detail, but had said that ASIO had been focused on individuals believed to be in that cell who were associated with the son, rather than the son himself.",
      "\"He was examined on the basis of being associated with others, and the assessment was made that there was no indication of any ongoing threat or threat of him engaging in violence,\" the prime minister said.",
      "During an earlier news conference, Australian police said they were looking for a potential third suspect, but Lanyon later confirmed that was no longer the case.",
      "More than 1,000 people were gathered at Bondi Beach in Sydney on Sunday. Albanese said the gunmen were \"deliberately targeting the Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah.\"",
      "The attack at the popular beach left at least 40 people injured, including two officers and three children, Australian officials said.",
      "Also among the injured is 43-year-old fruit seller Ahmed al Ahmed, who had been shot after he confronted one of the gunmen and wrestled the weapon away, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "One video\u00a0posted to social media shows al Ahmed jump out from behind a parked car along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, tackle one of the suspects who had just fired his gun, and wrestle the weapon away.",
      "President Trump, during an event at the White House on Sunday, said al Ahmed's actions \"saved a lot of lives.\"",
      "Anna Schecter, Emily Mae Czachor, Archie Clarke and Sam Vinograd contributed to this report, which has been updated to reflect Australian authorities saying the younger suspect is Australian-born.\u00a0Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

      "The U.S. military says it struck three more alleged drug-carrying boats in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, the latest in a campaign of vessel strikes ordered by the Trump administration that have killed at least 95 people in 25 boats.",
      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",
      "Southern Command also posted a 47-second video that appeared to show three separate strikes on vessels.",

Intelligence confirmed that the vessels were transiting along known\u2026 pic.twitter.com/IQfCVvUpau",
      "The U.S. military began striking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean in early September, part of what the Trump administration has described as a \"non-international armed conflict\" against drug cartels that it has designated as terror groups.",
      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

    "summary": "Officials said 15 people were shot and killed Sunday in a targeted attack on a Jewish holiday celebration, to mark the start of Hanukkah, in Australia's Bondi Beach.",
    "story": [
      "Officials said 15 people are dead after gunmen targeted the attendees of a Jewish community event\u00a0on Sunday in Australia's Bondi Beach. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including a child and two officers, according to police. Two of the suspects were identified as a father and a son, according to Mal Lanyon, the police commissioner of New South Wales.",
      "The 50-year-old father was killed, and the son \u2014 identified as 24-year-old Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police \u2014 was in custody in critical but stable condition, Lanyon said.",
      "\"Based on his medical condition, it is likely that the person may face criminal charges,\" Lanyon said in a separate update Sunday, but didn't go into further details.",
      "Australian officials and international leaders have condemned it as an antisemitic terrorist attack.",
      "Police said they expect the death toll to climb. Here is what we know so far.",
      "Gunfire broke out at a Hanukkah celebration",
      "The attack took place during a Jewish holiday celebration held to mark the first day of Hanukkah. More than 1,000 people were on the beach, in a suburb of Sydney, when shots rang out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon, who officially declared the shooting a \"terrorist incident.\"",
      "Numerous Australian officials have characterized the shooting as targeted. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah \u2014 which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith \u2014 an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism, that has struck the heart of our nation,\" Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said at a news conference.",
      "Video footage recorded by civilians showed frightened crowds of beachgoers fleeing the area as gunshots went off in the background.",
      "Neither officials nor police have identified the victims of the attack. Chabad, a global organization representing a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said Rabbi Eli Schlanger, with Chabad of Bondi, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, according to the organization.",
      "2 suspects identified as father and son",
      "Australian authorities said two gunmen were suspected of carrying out the deadly mass shooting, a rare occurrence in a country where gun violence is uncommon.",
      "Lanyon said the deceased suspect was previously known to the New South Wales police force. In addition to the 50-year-old gunman killed at the scene of the attack, another was hospitalized with serious injuries, he said. The surviving gunman, the 24-year-old son, has been taken into custody. The commissioner later said officers were not looking for an additional suspect.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, a Pakistani national based in Sydney, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police.",
      "Six licensed firearms were found at the scene, Lanyon said, adding that they all belong to the father. The police commissioner originally said that the older suspect had a gun licence for about 10 years. He later clarified that the father had been approved for a license in 2015, but that license lapsed after he failed to have his picture taken for the license as required by law. The father again applied for a license in 2020 and was granted one in 2023, Lanyon said. The suspect met the eligibility criteria for a recreational hunting license and \"was a member of a gun club,\" Lanyon said.",
      "\"We will look at the motives behind this attack and I think it is important as part of the investigation,\" he said.",
      "The pair traveled to the Philippines last month, Lanyon said, but noted investigators had not determined why they went or where specifically in the country they traveled.",
      "Good Samaritan disarmed one gunman",
      "A man has been lauded as a hero and praised by the police commissioner for tackling one suspect and disarming him in dramatic video footage recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that wraps around Bondi Beach. In the footage, the man could be seen crouched in hiding behind a parked car before wrestling the suspect and taking his weapon.",
      "Australian news outlets have identified the man seen disarming the suspect as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, citing his relatives.",
      "Al Ahmed was wounded in the attack and was set to undergo surgery Wednesday at St. George Hospital, according to Albanese. Albanese did not give further details on al Ahmed's condition, but said he met with him and family members, including al Ahmed's parents, on Tuesday to thank him for the lives he saved and wish him well.",
      "Officers found explosive devices, homemade ISIS flags",
      "Shortly after the shooting took place, officers who responded to the scene discovered a vehicle along Campbell Parade and believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside of it, Lanyon said. The vehicle was linked to the younger gunman, according to the police commissioner.",
      "Lanyon said at a press conference Tuesday that the vehicle also contained two homemade ISIS flags.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Although Australia rarely experiences mass shootings, after implementing stringent gun reform laws in the wake of a deadly 1996 massacre in Tasmania's Port Arthur, antisemitic incidents have been on the rise in the country since the war in Gaza began in 2023.",
      "The Australian government appointed special envoys in 2024 to address spiking antisemitism, as well as Islamophobia, in its communities. But attacks still happened this year. One, in July, involved an arsonist who set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, while worshippers were inside.",
      "World leaders react",
      "The attack on Bondi Beach drew widespread condemnation from leaders across the globe.",
      "In the U.S., Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke out against antisemitism in\u00a0a social media post, which said: \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio joined officials from numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, India, Qatar and Pakistan, who similarly shared remarks expressing sympathy for the victims and solidarity with Jewish communities, as well as denouncing antisemitism.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the officials in his country who responded publicly to the attack in Australia. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by his office, Netanyahu criticized Albanese for supporting a Palestinian state and said such support fuels antisemitism.",
      "\"Your call for a Palestinian state pours fuel on the antisemitic fire,\" Netanyahu's statement read, quoting a letter that the Israeli prime minister said he wrote to Albanese in August. \"It rewards Hamas terrorists. It emboldens those who menace Australian Jews and encourages the Jew hatred now stalking your streets.\"",
      "The American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group and charity organization, said the attack \"comes after repeated warnings, including from the Australian Jewish community itself,\" adding that \"allowing antisemitic rhetoric and demonstrations to go unchecked can\u2014and does\u2014lead to violence and death.\"",

      "Sheina Gutnick said that her father, Reuven Morrison, a 62-year-old Soviet-born member of the ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Australia, was killed while attempting to stop one of the two gunmen during Sunday's mass shooting, which Australian authorities have called an antisemitic terror attack.",
      "\"From my sources and understanding, he had jumped up the second the shooting started. He managed to throw bricks at the terrorist,\" Gutnick told CBS News in Bondi on Monday, referencing an attempt to stop one of the gunmen that was caught on camera during the attack the previous day.",

      "\"I believe after Ahmed managed to get the gun off the terrorist, my father had then gone to try and unjam the gun, to try and attempt shooting. He was screaming at the terrorist,\" she said. \"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members.\"",

I immediately felt the biggest pit in my stomach and tried calling my father who did not pick up the phone. I then called my mother and I heard screaming, shouting. She was screaming that there's an active shooter,\" Gutnick said. \"I called her back and she was yelling that he's running, he's running, and then that he has been shot. After a few more attempts of hanging up and calling back, my mother was yelling for medical assistance, screaming for an ambulance, screaming for help, asking for help ... she then advised that he's getting oxygen and hung up the phone.\"",
      "She said she managed to get her mother back on the phone, \"and she was screaming that they had stopped working on him and that he had been covered by a sheet. I was hoping in her hysterical state that she was just being delusional and that wasn't the case.\"",

      "Australian police, \"lay on the ground in the grass covering their heads, untrained for this massacre, untrained for what's to come, untrained for what the Jewish community has been telling the Australian government is inevitable,\" Gutnick said, adding her voice to a chorus of criticism after a documented rise in hate attacks aimed at Australia's Jewish residents.",

    "summary": "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on sedition charges, his daughter told reporters she hopes international pressure can spare her father.",
    "story": [
      "Hours after Jimmy Lai, a businessman and pro-democracy newspaper owner in Hong Kong, was found guilty on national security and sedition charges, his daughter Claire Lai told reporters in Washington, D.C., she hopes international pressure can spare her father from spending the rest of his life in prison.",
      "\"We expected the verdict,\" she told CBS News. \"As much as you can expect that, you can only be so ready for it. So I am grieving.\"",
      "Lai, 78, was found guilty on three charges: one sedition charge and two charges of violating the National Security Law, a controversial Hong Kong law instituted in 2020 following pro-democracy protests in 2019. The charges were conspiracy to commit collusion with a foreign country and conspiracy to publish seditious material.",
      "Lai is the founder of Apple Daily, a pro-democracy newspaper in Hong Kong that was often sharply critical of the Chinese government and its growing influence over the city. The paper closed in 2021 after police raided the newsroom, arrested reporters and froze the publication's assets. Jimmy Lai was arrested in 2020 and held in custody since.",
      "Jonathan Price, part of Jimmy Lai's international legal team, said the results of the trial were unsurprising, but argued they reflect China's reneging of commitments to the rule of law in Hong Kong and agreements made between the British and Chinese governments when Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The government in Beijing had agreed to grant Hong Kong autonomy until at least 2047, but it has increasingly exerted control over the enclave.",
      "\"It's 855 pages of obfuscation, fluff, diversion with some colorful language, but no substance,\" he told CBS News. \"It's extraordinary that a document of that length involving a case about someone who ran a press organization doesn't mention substantively, press freedom, freedom of speech, freedom to protest, or any human rights.\"",
      "Claire Lai last spoke to her father in June of this year, and said his condition has noticeably deteriorated. She described that his nails are changing colors and falling off and his teeth are rotting. She also worries about his diabetes and heart palpitations. She blames his prison conditions and solitary confinement for his deterioration.",
      "Claire Lai, her family and her legal team fear that appeals could take over 8 years and fear Jimmy Lai may not live long enough to endure the process.",
      "\"My father does not have eight years. If we wait to the end of the appeals process, there will not be a man at the end of that process,\" she told CBS News.",
      "On Monday, President Trump and British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper both called for the release of Jimmy Lai.",
      "In the Oval Office, Mr. Trump said, \"I feel so badly. I spoke to President Xi about it, and I asked to consider his release. He's not well. He's an older man, and he's not well. So I did put that request out, we'll see what happens.\"",
      "Cooper emphasized that Jimmy Lai is a British citizen and told Parliament that she had summoned the Chinese Ambassador after hearing the verdict.",
      "\"But for the sake of Jimmy Lai, for his family, but also for the people of Hong Kong, for the joint Declaration we signed, and for the rule of law, we will not relent on this,\" she said. \"Joined by nations across the world, we call again for the immediate release of Jimmy Lai.\"",

    "story": [
      "Wayne and Vanessa were at the event at Australia's famous Bondi Beach on Sunday with their two daughters, and they said it was a joyful, peaceful event to celebrate the start of the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, until it was shattered by two gunmen firing indiscriminately into the crowd.",
      "\"They were giving out donuts, and there was face painting and there was music, the kids were just having an absolute ball,\" Wayne told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King on Monday.",
      "Then, standing in a line with daughter Capri, Wayne heard what he first thought was a firecracker. Then there was another crack, and he realized it was gunfire.",
      "\"My daughter was in front of me. I just turned, I grabbed her, and I just saw a table and I just dived under this table and I just lay on top of my daughter Capri,\" he recalled. \"I was just lying on top of her, just shielding her.\"",
      "\"The bullets were just going off, people screaming and running and running. About two arm lengths from me, there was a guy shot on the floor who was screaming, 'help, help!'\" Wayne recalled.",
      "As rounds flew overhead, his wife called him, and they quickly realized they had lost track of their other little girl, Gigi, in the chaos.",
      "\"Vanessa calls me and says, 'Have you got the girls?' I'm like, 'I've got Capri. I'm on top of Capri. Where's Gigi? Gigi, you're with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' She said, 'No, I'm not with Gigi. Where's Gigi?' And at this stage, I thought, okay, I need to look for her, and I stuck my head out from under the table to look up into the field. And somebody shouted, 'There's gunshots!' I just heard gunshots. And the guy said, Get down, get down, get down. And I just thought, 'I just need to wait and protect my little Capri.'\"",
      "\"It was terrifying,\" said Vanessa. \"I'm screaming and the gunshots are going and I'm trying to run.\"",
      "She said she even tried to grab a police officer's gun at one point, \"to save more lives.\"",
      "\"I've got nothing to lose. I've gotta go, I've gotta go,\" the mother thought. \"I felt hopeless. I looked, I was watching the whole thing. I just see people on the ground. I called my mother and I said, 'Gigi's dead. Gigi is dead, Gigi's dead.' I just knew she was dead \u2026 What does a 3-year-old know? ... You think they're gonna drop to the ground and take cover? No. I just knew she'd be running around screaming. She was an easy target.\"",
      "Wayne eventually found his wife, handed their daughter Capri over to Vanessa, and then set out to look for Gigi.",
      "\"I ran back into the field to look for Gigi, and I was looking amongst the blood and the bodies and I found my little girl lying underneath this beautiful hero, an absolute brave hero, Jess. She was shielding my little baby from the gunshots,\" he told CBS News. \"It was the most special moment of my life to find her, and I took her number and I said, 'Jess, thank you. You're an absolute brave hero. You're an absolute superhero.\"",
      "Vanessa said Jess continued shooting video of the attackers even as she laid down over the Gigi to protect her, \"and you could see the guy on the bridge, shooting at her. Shooting towards her.\"",
      "She said she'd asked her husband whether he felt the event was safe just 15 minutes before the attack started, noting what seemed to her to be very few security personnel in the area.",
      "\"There were only two policemen there,\" Vanessa said. \"I didn't feel safe. I said to him, 'I don't feel safe.'\"",
      "The couple were highly critical of Australia's government, accusing officials of having \"done nothing to protect the Jewish communities\" in the country in the face of rising antisemitism.",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "According to data compiled by the council, antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number seen before Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Police officials in New South Wales state said at least 15 people were killed and 40 others remained in local hospitals following what Australian leaders have called an antisemitic attack.",
      "The suspects were a father and son. They had six firearms \u2014 legally owned by the 50-year-old father \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device, all allegedly to target the Jewish gathering, according to Australian authorities.",
      "\"It was ground zero,\" Ben Ferguson, among the emergency responders to reach the scene, told CBS News. \"We were all there, and ended up carrying bodies into the street.\"",
      "Ferguson, a lifeguard at the local Bondi surf club, said members of the club were among the first to provide medical attention to people wounded in the shooting, and he said they started doing so as soon as the gunfire stopped. \"We realized it was a mass shooting event when someone screamed that the gunman was reloading, and then we just knew that we were completely vulnerable.\"",
      "\"There was a really big feeling \u2026 a constant paranoia that a bomb was gonna go off. And we didn't know where the gunmen were,\" Ferguson told CBS News on Monday. \"The Surf club has a lot of medical resources ourselves, and so there was a lot of running over and delivering oxygen tanks.\"",

      "\"The rabbi who invited me, who was a dear dear friend of mine, who I would have been standing next to, was among the slaughtered,\" Ryvchin told CBS News.",

      "Schlanger's brother-in-law, Rabbi Mendel Kastel, was also at the event with his family.",
      "\"The last 24 hours is really, really difficult,\" Kastel told CBS News on Monday. \"You know, losing a brother-in-law, you know, a family member, so I'm directly affected. But at the same time, I've got a role in the community supporting others. It's been really difficult.\"",
      "Kastel lauded Schlanger as \"an amazing young man, a person who was committed to his work.\"",
      "\"He was committed to the community. People loved him. Wherever he went he took real interest in people and people took a real interest in him. He would visit people in hospitals, he'd visit people in prisons, he would teach people, he would teach bar mitzvahs. He would inspire other rabbis with his enthusiasm, his positivity,\" Kastel said.",
      "Shalom, a 20-year-old man from Miami who has been living in Bondi, told CBS News his friend was still hospitalized on Monday after being shot while near Schlanger.",
      "\"From what I've heard he was with the rabbi and another policeman, and all three of them got shot,\" Shalom said. \"My friend \u2026 he got shot twice, he got shot one in the stomach, came out, went out, and one in the leg.\"",
      "\"We were at the hospital the whole night last night, and we were with him, praying, just being there for him and he was on a breathing tube. They did a surgery and they said it [the bullet] hit one of his bowels and they fixed it up, and said he's stable, thank God,\" Shalom added.",
      "Grieving residents living in Bondi, a southern suburb of Sydney, came together Monday to lay flowers and mourn the dead following the shooting attack.",
      "For Rabbi Kastel, it's that community spirit that's the essence of what Hanukkah symbolizes.",

    "story": [
      "Hong Kong \u2014 Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media mogul and outspoken critic of Beijing, was convicted in a landmark national security trial in the city's court on Monday, which could send him to prison for the rest of his life.",
      "Three government-vetted judges found Lai, 78, guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. He pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "Lai was arrested in August 2020 under a Beijing-imposed national security law that was implemented following massive anti-government protests in 2019. During his five years in custody, much of it in solitary confinement, Lai has been convicted of several lesser offenses and appears to have grown more frail and thinner.",
      "Lai's trial, conducted without a jury, has been closely monitored by the U.S., Britain, the European Union and political observers as a barometer of media freedom and judicial independence in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Reading from an 855-page verdict, Judge Esther Toh said Lai had extended a \"constant invitation\" to the U.S. to help bring down the Chinese government with the excuse of helping Hong Kongers.",
      "Lai's lawyers admitted during the trial that he had called for sanctions before the law took effect but insisted he dropped these calls to comply with the law.",
      "But the judges ruled that Lai had never wavered in his intention to destabilize the ruling Chinese Communist Party, \"continuing though in a less explicit way.\"",
      "Toh said the court was satisfied that Lai was the mastermind of the conspiracies and that Lai's evidence was at times contradictory and unreliable. The judges ruled that the only reasonable inference from the evidence was that Lai's only intent, both before and after the security law, was to seek the downfall of the ruling Communist Party even at the sacrifice of the people of China and Hong Kong.",
      "\"This was the ultimate aim of the conspiracies and secessionist publications,\" they wrote.",
      "Among the attendees were Lai's wife and son, and Hong Kong's Roman Catholic Cardinal Joseph Zen. Lai pressed his lips and nodded to his family before being escorted out of the courtroom by guards.",
      "His verdict is also a test for Beijing's diplomatic ties. President Trump said he has raised the case with China, and U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said his government has made it a priority to secure the release of Lai, a British citizen.",
      "The founder of the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily will be sentenced on a later day.",
      "The collusion charge carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Hearings were set to begin Jan. 12 for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "The Apple Daily, a vocal critic of the Hong Kong government and Beijing, was forced to shut in 2021 after police raided its newsroom and arrested its senior journalists, with authorities freezing its assets.",
      "During Lai's 156-day trial, prosecutors accused him of conspiring with senior executives of Apple Daily and others to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades and engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "The prosecution also accused Lai of making such requests, highlighting his meetings with former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in July 2019 at the height of the protests.",
      "It also presented 161 publications, including Apple Daily articles, to the court as evidence, as well as social media posts and text messages.",
      "Lai testified for 52 days in his own defense, arguing that he had not called for foreign sanctions after the sweeping security law was imposed in June 2020.",
      "His legal team also argued for freedom of expression.",

      "As the trial progressed, Lai's health appeared to be deteriorating.",

      "\"His spirit is strong but his body is failing,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 15 Dec 2025 08:05:55 -0500",
    "summary": "For the second time in 3 decades, Australian leaders have vowed to respond quickly to a mass shooting with tighter gun ownership laws.",
    "story": [
      "Australian leaders quickly vowed to tighten up the country's laws on firearm ownership in the wake of the deadly gun attack on Jewish people at Bondi Beach on Sunday. Australia has a history of reacting quickly to gun violence with legislation, and many have credited a ban on rapid-fire long guns brought in following a 1996 mass-shooting with sharply reducing death in the years since.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese proposed new gun restrictions, including limiting the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain and reviewing existing licenses over time, just hours after decrying the Bondi Beach massacre as an act of antisemitic terrorism that struck at the heart of the nation.",
      "\"The government is prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws,\" Albanese said after authorities revealed that the older of the two suspected gunmen, who were father and son, had held a gun license for a decade and amassed his six guns legally. Those weapons, including rifles and at least one shotgun, were believed to have been used in the Sunday attack, according to police.",
      "Other government leaders also proposed restricting gun ownership to Australian citizens, a measure that would have excluded the older suspected gunman, who came to Australia in 1998 on a student visa and became a permanent resident after marrying a local woman, according to authorities. Officials wouldn't confirm what country he had migrated from.",
      "His son, who doesn't have a gun license, is an Australian-born citizen.",
      "The government leaders also proposed the \"additional use of criminal intelligence\" in deciding who was eligible for a gun license. That could hypothetically have meant that a 2019 investigation into the son's suspicious associates, confirmed Monday by Albanese, would have disqualify the father from owning a gun.",
      "Christopher Minns, premier of New South Wales, where Bondi, a suburb of Sydney, is located, said his state's gun laws would change, but he could not yet detail how.",
      "\"It means introducing a bill to Parliament to \u2014  I mean to be really blunt \u2014 make it more difficult to get these horrifying weapons that have no practical use in our community,\" Minns said. \"If you're not a farmer, you're not involved in agriculture, why do you need these massive weapons that put the public in danger and make life dangerous and difficult for New South Wales Police?\"",
      "Australia's ban on semi-automatic long guns came after 1996 massacre",
      "The attack was the deadliest shooting in almost three decades in Australia, since the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, in which 35 people were murdered.",
      "Just 12 days after that shooting, Australian lawmakers approved legislation banning the sale and importation of all automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns; forcing people to present a legitimate reason, and wait 28 days, to buy any firearm; and initiating a massive, mandatory gun-buyback for banned weapons.",
      "The Australian government confiscated and destroyed nearly 700,000 firearms in the wake of the law being adopted, reducing the number of gun-owning households by half.",
      "\"It is incontestable that gun-related homicides have fallen quite significantly in Australia, incontestable,\" former Australian Prime Minister John Howard, who defied many in his own conservative party to usher in the new laws, told CBS News' Seth Doane two decades later, in 2016.",
      "In the 15 years before those laws were passed, there were 13 mass shootings in Australia. In the two decades since, there was not a single one. Gun homicides overall decreased by nearly 60% in the same period.",
      "\"People used to say to me, 'You violated my human rights by taking away my gun,'\" Howard told CBS News. \"And I'd [respond], 'I understand that. Will you please understand the argument, the greatest human right of all is to live a safe life without fear of random murder.'\"",
      "Asked to respond to critics who said the fall in gun deaths did not necessarily happen because of the legislation, Howard told CBS News: \" I can say that, because all the surveys indicate it.\"",
      "\"The number of deaths from mass shootings, gun-related homicide has fallen, gun related suicide has fallen,\" he said. \"Isn't that evidence? Or are we expected to believe that that was all magically going to happen? Come on!\"",
      "A study published earlier this year, however, found that Australia still had some way to go to fully implement the 2016 legislation, called the National Firearms Agreement. The paper, by the Australia Institute think tank, said some of the measures in the law had yet to be fully brought into force 29 years later, and that others were being inconsistently enforced across different states.",
      "The law \"was ambitious, politically brave, and necessary for public safety,\" the report concluded, lauding Howard's will to defy his fellow lawmakers.",
      "However, \"Australia still allows minors to hold firearm licenses, still lacks a National Firearms Register, and still has inconsistent laws that make enforcement difficult,\" the group said, adding that overall gun ownership across the country had actually boomed over the last three decades.",
      "\"There are now over four million registered privately owned guns in Australia: 800,000 more than before the (1996) buyback,\" the institute said in its May report. \"Australians needs gun laws that live up to the Howard Government's bravery, and right now Australia does not have them.\"",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 people had gathered on Bondi Beach on a warm day to celebrate the first night of Hanukkah in Australia. In stark contrast to the joyful energy on the beach, a terror plot was underway, allegedly planned in advance by a father and son who opened fire with rifles into the crowd, with an improvised explosive device at the ready in their car.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Monday that the younger suspect had been investigated by the country's primary intelligence agency in 2019 \u2014 reportedly over links to a suspected ISIS cell in Sydney \u2014   but that he was deemed to represent no security threat.",
      "\"This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians,\" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Sunday's mass shooting \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said it was \"designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\"",
      "Police should have been on high alert, given that it was a Hanukkah celebration and antisemitic threats and attacks have skyrocketed in Australia in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, according to data from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "Yet the two assailants were allegedly able to fire shots toward the beach for more than five minutes, according to eyewitness accounts. Videos show the gunmen taking their time to aim, shoot and then duck from a bridge near the beach. One video shows a good Samaritan jumping on the back of one of the shooters and wrestling his gun away. Local media reported that the man who intervened, identified as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed, suffered two gunshot wounds.",
      "\"The first initial reaction wasn't even by police, it was by civilians, which raised a lot of questions about the role of police,\" said Oded Ailam, who worked in Israeli intelligence for two decades and reviewed videos of the attack for CBS News.",
      "Asked about police response time at a news conference Monday local time, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said, \"I respect a person having an opinion, but I've been really clear: Our police responded promptly. Our police respond very promptly. We work closely with the Jewish community. We are very attuned with providing support to the Jewish community.\"",
      "Ailam told CBS News, \"Everything points to this being a preplanned attack that was planned for a significant amount of time. The big question now is if Iran and Hezbollah will be implicated.\"",
      "Australia earlier this year determined a series of previous arson attacks targeting a synagogue and a Kosher food provider had been directed by Iran, and moved to cut diplomatic ties over the incidents.",
      "\"As a matter of principle, Iran condemns the violent attack against civilians in Sydney, Australia,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Sunday on social media. \"Terror violence and mass killing shall be condemned, wherever they're committed, as unlawful and criminal.\"",
      "When asked by reporters about whether Sunday's shooting was an intelligence failure, New South Wales officials waved off the questions and said their priority is keeping the community safe.",
      "The alleged assailants were a father and son duo. U.S. officials told CBS News on Sunday that they were from Pakistan, but Australian authorities later said the son was Australian-born, and they have not confirmed which country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "They had six firearms \u2014 purchased legally \u2014 and had assembled an improvised explosive device to target the Jewish gathering, according to authorities.",
      "While shocking, the attack is not entirely surprising to people who track antisemitic attacks.",
      "Rising antisemitism in Australia",
      "Australia has been plagued by reports of antisemitic attacks and incidents in the two years following Oct. 7, 2023, according to new figures from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry.",
      "In one particularly notable incident last year, masked assailants conducted an arson attack on the Adass Israel synagogue in Melbourne. Seven months later an arsonist set fire to the doors of another Melbourne synagogue, the downtown East Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, forcing the congregation to flee.",
      "Another arson attack was carried out at the kosher food provider Lewis Continental Kitchen in Sydney, also last year.",
      "The attacks on both the Adass Israel synagogue and the food company were determined by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) to be tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. In August, Prime Minister Albanese expelled Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Sadeghi, and three other Iranian diplomats, citing the intelligence assessment concluding that Iran had directed antisemitic arson attacks on Australian soil.",
      "The ECAJ found antisemitic incidents in Australia remain at historically high levels \u2014 almost five times the average annual number before Oct. 7, 2023, which is the largest spike of any J7 country between 2021 and 2024. J7 refers to the seven countries with the largest Jewish communities outside Israel that form the J7 Task Force Against Antisemitism: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Argentina and Australia.",
      "The J7 Task Force met in Sydney less than one week before Sunday's attack to discuss the growing security threat to the Jewish community in Australia.",
      "\"This attack is not only the latest in a disturbing series of antisemitic incidents in Australia but also around the globe, including in the United States,\" said Oren Segal, senior vice president of counter-extremism and intelligence at the Anti-Defamation League. \"And these incidents are becoming increasingly violent.\"",

    "summary": "At least 15 people were killed at a Jewish gathering on Australia's Bondi Beach, according to Australian government officials and police. One of two gunmen was also dead.",
    "story": [
      "An attack targeting a Jewish gathering at a famous Australian beach on Sunday killed at least 15 people, including a 12-year-old, government officials and police said. Another 40 people were hospitalized with injuries, including two officers and three children.",
      "Police said on Monday that two gunmen \u2014 a 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son \u2014 had opened fire at Bondi Beach while the local Jewish community was celebrating the first night of Hanukkah. The 50-year-old gunman died, while his son was remained hospitalized in a coma on Monday, according to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.",
      "The 24-year-old was identified as Naveed Akram, according to a U.S. intelligence briefing and a driver's license provided by Australian police. Police previously said the deceased gunman was the son, but Lanyon later clarified that the father was shot and killed by police.",
      "Officials had told CBS News on Sunday that Akram was a Pakistani national, but Australian officials later said he was Australian-born. Officials have not confirmed what country the father migrated to Australia from.",
      "Albanese confirmed on Monday that Akram had been investigated for about six months during 2019 by the country's primary intelligence agency. National public broadcaster the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported that the probe was over suspected links to an alleged ISIS cell in Sydney. Albanese said the investigation had determined that Akram posed no apparent threat to public safety.",
      "New South Wales Health Minister Ryan Park said a 12-year-old child was among those killed in the attack. Three other children are being treated in the hospital, he said.",
      "\"This is absolutely horrendous for the community broadly, but particularly the Jewish community. ... What we saw last night was the worst of humanity, but at the same time, the very best of humanity,\" Park said.",
      "Officials have not identified the victims of the attack, although the international organization Chabad, which represents a branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism, said that one of its rabbis, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, was among the dead, the Associated Press reported. Schlanger had been a key organizer of the Hanukkah celebration where the shooting took place.",
      "Called Hanukkah by the Sea, the event was held to mark the beginning of the Jewish holiday observed from sundown on Sunday until Monday, Dec. 22. More than 1,000 were at the beach when gunfire broke out, said New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon. He called the attack a \"terrorist incident\" and said the perpetrators used \"long arms,\" referring to long guns such as shotguns or rifles, to carry it out.",
      "New South Wales Premier Chris Minns and Albanese also characterized the attack as targeted, with Minns saying it \"was designed to target Sydney's Jewish community.\" The prime minister said it was \"a targeted attack on Jewish Australians.\"",
      "\"What we saw yesterday was an act of pure evil, an act of antisemitism, an act of terrorism on our shores in an iconic Australian location, Bondi Beach, that is associated with joy, associated with families gathering, associated with celebrations, and it is forever tarnished by what has occurred last evening,\" Albanese said during a news conference on Monday morning local time.",
      "Lanyon said police believed there were several improvised explosive devices inside a vehicle at Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach, which they discovered shortly after the shooting occurred. A rescue bomb disposal crew was at the scene.",
      "International leaders have publicly condemned the attack.",
      "\"The United States strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Australia targeting a Jewish celebration,\" wrote U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in\u00a0a social media post. \"Antisemitism has no place in this world. Our prayers are with the victims of this horrific attack, the Jewish community, and the people of Australia.\"",
      "Rubio's statement echoed others from officials in Israel, New Zealand, India, the United Kingdom and a number of European countries who similarly spoke out to denounce antisemitism and share their condolences after the shooting.",
      "King Charles also addressed the shooting in a statement, in which the monarch said he and Queen Camilla were \"appalled and saddened by the most dreadful antisemitic terrorist attack on Jewish people\" attending the Bondi Beach Hanukkah event.",
      "\"In times of hurt, Australians always rally together in unity and resolve,\" he said in the statement, adding that Australia's \"spirit of community and love ... will always triumph over the darkness of such evil.\"",
      "Gunman disarmed by bystander, video shows",
      "Images and video footage have emerged from the scene of the attack, showing the injured being wheeled away on stretchers by first responders.",
      "\"The scenes in Bondi are shocking and distressing,\" said Albanese in a statement. \"My thoughts are with every person affected.\"",
      "One video appeared to show someone wrestling with one of the suspected gunmen and taking his weapon from him, according to Minns, who paid tribute to that individual in some of his comments Sunday.",
      "The video was recorded by a bystander along Campbell Parade, a main street that runs parallel to Bondi Beach. In it, a man jumped up from a crouched position behind a parked car and tackled the suspect, who had just fired his weapon toward something out of view.",
      "Following a short struggle, the man disarmed the suspect, pushed him to the ground and turned the weapon on him, at which point the suspect stood up and walked in the opposite direction. The man then lowered the weapon and raised his free hand in the air. Off to the side, one person appeared to be lying unresponsive on the sidewalk beside a different vehicle.",
      "In additional footage, which was also filmed by bystanders, crowds could be seen fleeing Bondi Beach as shots rang out in the background.",
      "Minns called the man, named by relatives to Australian media as fruit shop owner Ahmed al Ahmed, a \"genuine hero.\"",
      "Rare shooting",
      "Mass shootings in Australia are rare. But researchers have recorded dramatic upticks in antisemitic incidents in the country since the Oct. 7, 2023, assault by Hamas terrorists on Israel triggered the war in Gaza, along with spikes in hate incidents against Muslim groups.",
      "In response, the Australian government appointed special envoys last year to address antisemitism and Islamophobia in its communities. However, attacks have continued to happen since then. In July, an arsonist set fire to the door of a synagogue in Melbourne, another major Australian city, seven months after a different synagogue in the same city was burned by criminals in a blaze that injured one worshipper.",
      "This article has been updated to note that Australian authorities said the younger suspect is Australian-born. Police in India's Telangana state later confirmed on Dec. 16 that the older suspect, Sajid Akram, was an Indian national from\u00a0the state's capital city Hyderabad.",

    "story": [
      "An Italian archaeological mission has discovered the remains of a sun temple belonging to an ancient Egyptian king near Cairo, the Egyptian antiquities ministry said.",
      "The temple of King Nyuserre is believed to be from the Fifth Dynasty and the remains were found in the Abusir necropolis south of the Egyptian capital.",
      "It is part of a monumental complex dedicated to the cult of the sun god Ra and is one of the few solar temples identified to date.",
      "The site was identified as early as 1901 by the German archaeologist Ludwig Borchardt --known for his 1912 discovery of the famous bust of ancient Egyptian queen Nefertiti -- but a high water table prevented any excavation at the time.",
      "According to the ministry, the mission has uncovered for the first time more than half of the temple, long buried under River Nile sediment.",
      "The ministry described a colossal structure of over 1,000 square meters \"with a unique architecture that ranks it among the largest and most remarkable valley temples in the Memphis necropolis\", a stretch of ancient funerary complexes.",
      "Architectural features including column bases, wall coverings, and granite thresholds have been identified, as well as a sloping ramp \"likely connecting the temple to the Nile or one of its branches\", the ministry said.",
      "The team also found two wooden pieces of the ancient Egyptian \"Sunnat\" game, resembling modern chess, te ministry added.",
      "Abusir, about 12 miles south of Cairo, is an archaeological site that notably contains the pyramids of several pharaohs, though they are modest in size compared to the pyramids of Giza.",
      "Six solar temples are believed to have been built during the reign of the pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty, according to the University of Leicester.",
      "Only the remains of two temples have been confirmed to date, including that of Nyuserre, according to the British university, which is famous for identifying the remains of Richard III, the English king who died more than five centuries ago.",
      "Earlier this month, a treasure trove of 225 funerary figurines was discovered inside a tomb in the ancient Egyptian capital of Tanis in the Nile Delta. The royal symbol on the figurines solved a long-standing mystery by identifying who was buried in the sarcophagus: It was pharaoh Shoshenq III, who reigned from 830 to 791 BC.",
      "Egypt reveals restored colossal statues of pharaoh in Luxor",
      "Meanwhile, Egypt on Sunday revealed the revamp of two colossal statues of a prominent pharaoh in the southern city of Luxor, the Associated Press reported.",
      "The giant alabaster statues, known as the Colossi of Memnon, were reassembled in a renovation project that lasted about two decades. They represent Amenhotep III, who ruled ancient Egypt about 3,400 years ago.",
      "\"Today we are celebrating, actually, the finishing and the erecting of these two colossal statues,\" Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, told The Associated Press ahead of the ceremony.",
      "Ismail said the colossi are of great significance to Luxor, a city known for its ancient temples and other antiquities. They're also an attempt to \"revive how this funerary temple of king Amenhotep III looked like a long time ago,\" Ismail said.",
      "Amenhotep III, one of the most prominent pharaohs, ruled during the 500 years of the New Kingdom, which was the most prosperous time for ancient Egypt. The pharaoh, whose mummy is showcased at a Cairo museum, ruled between 1390\u20131353 BC, a peaceful period known for its prosperity and great construction, including his mortuary temple, where the Colossi of Memnon are located, and another temple, Soleb, in Nubia.",
      "The colossi were toppled by a strong earthquake in about 1200 BC that also destroyed Amenhotep III's funerary temple, said Mohamed Ismail, secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.",
      "They were fragmented and partly quarried away, with their pedestals dispersed. Some of their blocks were reused in the Karnak temple, but archaeologists brought them back to rebuild the colossi, according to the Antiquities Ministry.",
      "In late 1990s, an Egyptian German mission, chaired by German Egyptologist Hourig Sourouzian, began working in the temple area, including the assembly and renovation of the colossi.",
      "\"This project has in mind \u2026 to save the last remains of a once-prestigious temple,\" she said.",
      "The statues show Amenhotep III seated with hands resting on his thighs, with their faces looking eastward toward the Nile and the rising sun. They wear the nemes headdress surmounted by the double crowns and the pleated royal kilt, which symbolizes the pharaoh's divine rule.",
      "Two other small statues on the pharaoh's feet depict his wife, Tiye.",
      "Sunday's unveiling in Luxor came just six weeks after the inauguration of the long-delayed Grand Egyptian Museum, the centerpiece of the government's bid to boost the country's tourism industry and bring cash into the troubled economy. The mega project is located near the famed Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"Face the Nation.\" We're joined now by the Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. Good to have you back.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: It's great to be back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So people are holiday shopping. They're aware of prices. The president said this week prices are coming down tremendously. The latest data, though, from the Consumer Price Index is up 3% year over year, personal consumption index is up 2.8% year over year. What data is he looking at? What's your benchmark?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, one of the things that if you saw his presentation in Pennsylvania, as he put up a bunch of charts, which he loves to do, where he went through the individual items that we've already sort of made a bunch of progress on. And so, for example, under Joe Biden, prescription drugs were up 9%. So far this year, they're down six tenths of a percent. Gasoline is way down. It was like the highest ever under Biden--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Eggs, he was talking about eggs, yeah.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, he was talking about eggs. And so I think the way to think about inflation, of course, is that there are like micro effects, like the time that we had the avian flu affecting drug prices. And then macro effects, which is runaway spending, big deficits and then an accommodative Fed policy. And I think--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But now tariffs adding to some price increases according to the Fed chair.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I- you know, I think that the tariff evidence is mixed. But the point is that we've got deficit going way, way down. So right now, it's looking like the deficit for this year will be $600 billion lower than it was last year. That really helps lower inflation. We've got the trade deficit cut in half from last year. And so all of these things are things that should continue to move us towards the Fed target of 2%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Companies aren't necessarily going to bring items down, though, in terms of pricing, right? I mean, the- the president told the Wall Street Journal he didn't know when all of this money, quote, \"is going to kick in.\" I think he was talking to business investment and tariffs, and help voters, \"all I can do is do my job.\" When do you anticipate voters will feel this positive impact?",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, it's definitely the case that, and you guys have been covered a lot, that consumer sentiment right now is lower than anyone would like. But, you know, we find that that very often happens during a government shutdown when everybody's really upset--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the last administration called that the \"vibecession,\" right?",
      "HASSETT: No, but--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --the data is good, but people feel bad.",
      "HASSETT: --Yeah, but what's going to happen is--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Same thing, you're saying.",
      "HASSETT: No what's- I'm not saying that. What- what I'm saying is that people are going to see the high growth. Growth is 4%. Income growth is up about $1,200 this year. People look at their wallets and see they're doing better, which is why we had the biggest Black Friday ever and so on and so--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's more higher income se--",
      "HASSETT: --The sentiment will catch up with the reality. Under Joe Biden, the fact is that real purchasing power dropped by about $3,000. So far this year, it's up by about $1,200 per family. And the money that we're talking about is like real money. So for groceries, it went from $400 a month to $525 a month under Biden. So that's like an extra more than $1,000 a year. You have to spend on groceries. It's down this year for us, for the grocery package, but it's still got a lot of room to grow- to go.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A lot more to go--",
      "HASSETT: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the president reduced some tariffs on some of those grocery items--",
      "HASSETT: --On the food stuff--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --with an eye towards that.",
      "HASSETT: Yeah, if we don't make it here, then pretty much we don't tariff it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you, you mentioned gas. Oil prices globally are relatively low. We saw this Coast Guard interdiction with military forces boarding and seizing this vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Do you feel you have the leeway there, pricing-wise, to conduct more seizures or even a blockade of oil from Venezuela, without it hurting?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm not a foreign policy guy, so what we do with Venezuela and whether we blockade is up to the president and Marco Rubio. But I could say that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --But you've got the leeway, right--",
      "HASSETT: --that- that what's been going on is there's been kind of a black market for oil amongst sort of this sanctioned countries. And what we're doing is we're shutting that black market down. Whether that affects prices outside of the sanctioned countries is kind of an open question. Probably not.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think it will?",
      "HASSETT: No, because they're already kind of on the ropes, these countries. They're only getting oil when they get like sort of black fleets to sneak in and give them the oil. And that's what we're trying to slow down.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about the Fed decision. The Federal Open Market Committee said job gains have slowed this year. We also saw the survey from the Business Roundtable. I'm sure you saw it. They asked CEOs what they expect to happen, and they anticipate employment will decrease in 2026 rather than increase. Are you concerned about a hiring slowdown?",
      "HASSETT: The same Fed said that they were more bullish on growth for next year, right? And so I think that we're at a certain--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But on the jobs picture.",
      "HASSETT: But on the jobs picture, you know, we're going to get the data next week. And so maybe next Sunday I'll come back and we'll talk about it, because we've got two months of data coming out on Tuesday. And we'll get a clearer picture because right now we just have some very difficult to pin down surveys like the gold standard for this will be really the household survey, which we don't even get for October.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these are CEOs. They're the people who would be doing the hiring, right? And they're saying, we're not doing it.",
      "HASSETT: But, but they don't have the broad perspective that we'll get when we get the big data released next week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that big data?",
      "HASSETT: I trust the household survey, especially. And sadly, we won't have one for October. But we're going to get one for November. And that's going to be really important for thinking about where the job market is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Employment is one of the things that the Fed watches closely. And we heard again from the president that you were on this short list to be potentially the next Fed chair, although he was conducting interviews this week. He said you and Hoover's Kevin Warsh are at the top of the list. On Friday, the president was asked how big of a role he wants to personally play in future Fed interest rate decisions. Take a listen.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE BEGINS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I think I certainly should have a role in talking to whoever the head of the Fed is, or the Fed. I don't think- you know the old days that used to happen. Nowadays, it's sort of, they think it shouldn't happen. But I've done great. I've made a lot of money, I'm very successful. I think my voice should be heard.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 As Fed chair, how frequently would you consult with the president when he says he wants his voice heard?",
      "HASSETT: Well, I'm right now the top economic advisor for the president, and I talk about almost everything with him almost every day. I've certainly talked about monetary policy. I think he has very strong and well-founded views about what we ought to do. But in the end, the job of the Fed is to be independent and to work with the group of people that are on the Board of Governors, at the FOMC, to drive a group consensus on where interest rates should be and to do so, you know, basically with the guidance of the Fed chair. But in the end, it's a committee that votes. And I'd be happy to talk to the president every day, you know, until both of us are dead because it's so much fun to talk--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Even if you were Fed Chair.",
      "HASSETT:\u00a0 Even if I were Fed Chair or if I wasn't Fed Chair. You know what, I would hope that Kevin Warsh would be talking to the president as well if he were Fed Chair.",

      "HASSETT: You know, every Fed Chair talks to lots and lots of market experts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Equal to the other members- of the voting members or?",
      "HASSETT: Excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Would the president's voice have equal weighting to the voting members?",
      "HASSETT: No, no, he would have no weight. It's just his opinion matters if it's good, you know, if it's based on data. And then if you go to the committee and you say, well, the president made this argument and that's a really sound argument, I think, what do you think? If they reject it, then they'll vote in a different way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Well, we'll be watching to see what happens. Kevin Hassett.",
      "HASSETT: Great to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thanks as always. We'll be right back.",

      "The 66-year-old British TV personality and record executive rose to global prominence when he served as a judge on the singing competition series, the U.K.'s \"Pop Idol\" and its mega-hit spin-off \"American Idol,\" where he became known for his blunt critiques and ability to spot commercial talent quickly. Cowell went on to create the massively successful franchises \"The X Factor\" and \"Got Talent\" and helped launch the careers of major artists through his company Syco Entertainment.",

      "\"When someone's not great, the audience is very quiet,\" Cowell continued. \"When an act is fantastic, it can either get really loud or you have that perfect silence. So I've always learned to read an audience. Or certainly when you've got people around you. So when I was auditioning on the show, we had a lot of people in the room with us. And when someone did walk in, the whole energy changed.\"",
      "Over the years, Cowell has helped transform previously unknown singers into global stars. On \"American Idol,\" Cowell's commentary helped spotlight breakout talents such as Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, while \"The X Factor\" provided a direct artist-development pipeline that produced acts like One Direction, Little Mix and Leona Lewis.",

      "Cowell has previously said that he believes that the contestants are better served by brutal honesty rather than sugar-coated feedback or unearned praise. During his interview with Fox News Digital, Cowell reflected on how he approached interactions with contestants after failed auditions.",
      "\"If I get to see them afterwards, I will go and talk to them and tell them why I didn't like them,\" he said. \"Sometimes I can give them advice. I mean that there are times \u2014 I'm not gonna lie \u2014 where people come in and I'm thinking, 'Wow, I just don't see this happening to you because you're not singing well. I don't think singing lessons are gonna help.' And sometimes you've got to give people a different steer in life.\"",
      "\"I'm a great believer \u2014 you just don't bulls--- people,\"Cowell continued. \"I've learned that on a personal level when I was starting up in the music business. You know, it was tough, you know, and I kind of learnt to do my job well because people fortunately were the same with me. They were very, very, very blunt with me and told me whether I was doing something good or bad. And that's the way you learn. And that's when I decided eventually that I was gonna be on camera after doing this, I was like, 'Well, I'm not gonna lie to anyone. I've gotta be honest with them. Some people will appreciate it, other people not so much.'\"",

      "A 2025 Mayo Clinic review found that just 10 minutes of heavy snow shoveling can push the heart to about 97% of its maximum rate. Exposure to cold air was also found to increase blood pressure and reduce coronary blood flow.",
      "While there isn\u2019t an official age that\u2019s \"too old\" to shovel, some cardiologists recommend that individuals over 45 should exercise more caution to lower their chances of a cardiac event.",
      "When to take caution",
      "\"While there's no strict age cutoff, generally above the age of mid 40s and above, we tend to be a little more cautious \u2014 particularly in people who are less active [without] regular exercise,\" Dr. Navjot Kaur Sobti, M.D., an interventional cardiologist at Northwell\u2019s Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York, told Fox News Digital.",

      "That study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month, also found that those over age 65 had higher rates of temperature-related deaths.",

      "Safer shoveling tips",
      "The cardiologist said it\u2019s ideal to have someone else help with snow removal \u2014 but if you do choose to use a shovel, she recommends pacing yourself and using a \"pushing or sweeping\" motion instead of heavy lifting.",
      "Recent research has shown that cold exposure accounts for nearly twice as many cardiovascular deaths as heat exposure. (iStock)",
      "To protect against the cold, Sobti also recommends covering your mouth, nose and extremities, wearing a hat and gloves, and using extra caution in windy conditions.",

      "FIRST ON FOX:\u00a0In a letter sent to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday, Trump's education secretary blasted his handling of the massive and developing fraud crisis in the state and called on him to resign from his post over the scandal while highlighting fraud allegations within the state's college education system.",
      "\"You have been Minnesota\u2019s Governor since 2019,\" Education Secretary Linda McMahon wrote to Walz in a letter obtained by Fox News Digital. \"During that time, your careless lack of oversight and abuse of the welfare system has attracted fraudsters from around the world, especially from Somalia, to establish a beachhead of criminality in our country. As President Trump put it, you have turned Minnesota into a \u2018fraudulent hub of money laundering activity.\u2019\"",

      "Last week,\u00a0Fox News Digital reported the Department of Education announcement that it has thwarted more than $1 billion in student aid fraud under Trump\u2019s first year in office, including stopping suspected bots and \"ghost students\" from obtaining taxpayer-funded loans.",

They collected checks from the federal government, shared a small portion of the money with the college, and pocketed the rest \u2014 without attending the college at all.\"",
      "The letter mentions efforts the department has taken to crack down on \"ghost students\" nationwide, including \"mandatory identity verification\" for certain first-time applicants.",
      "The letter also takes aim at Minnesota Democratic Rep.

      "The letter goes on to accuse Walz of presiding over what federal officials describe as a \"massive scandal of welfare fraud\" that spread across virtually every major federal assistance program. According to the letter, scammers operating in Minnesota enriched themselves by exploiting federal housing benefits, education aid, food stamps, small-business relief, and even programs meant to support elderly Americans and children with autism, all while the governor \"did absolutely nothing\" to stop it.",
      "\"Shame on you, Governor Walz, for allowing this to happen \u2014 and for benefiting from it,\" McMahon wrote to Walz. \"Stop defrauding American taxpayers. No politician is above the law, and my department, alongside every other agency under the leadership of President Trump, will continue to ensure that you will not be able to dodge accountability for your actions.\"",

      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",

      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",

    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",

      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking. It reflects where the field as a whole is headed toward integrated markerless solutions that give athletes and coaches clearer insight with far less friction.\"",

But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",

      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",
      "Steps to stay safe in your smart home",
      "Strong habits and a few simple tools can block the most common threats that target connected homes.",

      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",

      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you or someone you love manages diabetes, fewer needle sticks could change your routine. A quick scan may replace the stress of drawing blood or inserting a sensor.

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",

      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A futuristic food dome at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai offered a surprising look at how cities may grow fresh food close to home.",
      "Inspired by a classic greenhouse, the Inochi no Izumi or Source of Life dome showed how a compact closed-loop ecosystem could sit on rooftops or in small urban spaces. It looked like a tiny house full of produce powered by nature.",

      "This dome creates a full food ecosystem by recycling water and nutrients in a closed loop. (VikingDome)",
      "Inside the Source of Life dome",
      "The 21-foot structure sits on a base with four water zones that support marine fish, brackish species and freshwater species. Their waste creates the nutrients that feed the plant layers above. Microbes convert ammonia into nitrates that plants love.",
      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest. The layout functions like an ecological slice from ocean to land instead of floors.",
      "Transparent ETFE panels pull in light and help the dome keep a stable climate. Water pumps send nutrients upward and then return clean water to each tank. The loop creates almost no waste and keeps cycling with little input.",
      "BEEF INDUSTRY SLAMS LAB-GROWN HYBRID MEAT AS SCIENTISTS PROMISE GREENER STEAKS",
      "Plants grow in stacked hydroponic layers that match the salinity zones of the aquatic life below. (VikingDome)",
      "How cities may use systems like this",
      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",
      "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology designed the system to copy nature. It follows the same recycling found in healthy wetlands. By letting biology do the work, the system reduces strain on land and water.",
      "The system shows how cities may produce fresh food on rooftops and small urban spaces. (VikingDome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This model hints at a future where fresh food sits closer to your kitchen. A dome like this could sit on an apartment building or a school and provide herbs, produce and edible flowers. It cuts travel time from farm to table and gives communities more control over their food supply.",
      "If a storm or disaster blocks access to farms, a closed-loop dome can keep growing. For people with tiny yards or no soil, it offers a realistic way to produce clean food in small spaces.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Source of Life dome may be a prototype, but it delivers a vivid preview of urban food production. It combines architecture, ecology and aquaculture in a compact package that uses every drop of water. If future cities adopt systems like this, access to fresh food could improve for millions.",

      "'Outnumbered' panelists react to OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's admission that he 'cannot imagine' raising his newborn son without help from ChatGPT.",
      "ChatGPT went from novelty to necessity in less than two years. It is now part of how you work, learn, write, code and search. OpenAI has said the service has roughly 800 million weekly active users, which puts it in the same weight class as the biggest consumer platforms in the world.",
      "When a tool becomes that central to your daily life, you assume the people running it can keep your data safe. That trust took a hit recently after OpenAI confirmed that personal information linked to API accounts had been exposed in a breach involving one of its third-party partners.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "The breach highlights how even trusted analytics partners can expose sensitive account details. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the ChatGPT breach",
      "OpenAI's notification email places the breach squarely on Mixpanel, a major analytics provider the company used on its API platform. The email stresses that OpenAI's own systems were not breached. No chat histories, billing information, passwords or API keys were exposed. Instead, the stolen data came from Mixpanel's environment and included names, email addresses, Organization IDs, coarse location and technical metadata from user browsers.",
      "FAKE CHATGPT APPS ARE HIJACKING YOUR PHONE WITHOUT YOU KNOWING",
      "That sounds harmless on the surface. The email calls this \"limited\" analytics data, but the label feels like PR cushioning more than anything else. For attackers, this kind of metadata is gold. A dataset that reveals who you are, where you work, what machine you use and how your account is structured gives threat actors everything they need to run targeted phishing and impersonation campaigns.",
      "The biggest red flag is the exposure of Organization IDs. Anyone who builds on the OpenAI API knows how sensitive these identifiers are. They sit at the center of internal billing, usage limits, account hierarchy and support workflows. If an attacker quotes your Org ID during a fake billing alert or support request, it suddenly becomes very hard to dismiss the message as a scam.",
      "OpenAI's own reconstructed timeline raises bigger questions. Mixpanel first detected a smishing attack on November 8. Attackers accessed internal systems the next day and exported OpenAI's data. That data was gone for more than two weeks before Mixpanel told OpenAI on November 25. Only then did OpenAI alert everyone. It is a long and worrying silent period, and it left API users exposed to targeted attacks without even knowing they were at risk. OpenAI says it cut Mixpanel off the next day.",
      "The size of the risk and the policy problem behind it",
      "The timing and the scale matter here. ChatGPT sits at the center of the generative AI boom. It does not just have consumer traffic. It has sensitive conversations from developers, employees, startups and enterprises. Even though the breach affected API accounts rather than consumer chat history, the exposure still highlights a wider issue. When a platform reaches almost a billion weekly users, any crack becomes a national-scale problem.",
      "Regulators have been warning about this exact scenario. Vendor security is one of the weak links in modern tech policy. Data protection laws tend to focus on what a company does with the information you give them. They rarely provide strong guardrails around the entire chain of third-party services that process this data along the way. Mixpanel is not an obscure operator. It is a widely used analytics platform trusted by thousands of companies. Yet it still lost a dataset that should never have been accessible to an attacker.",
      "Companies should treat analytics providers the same way they treat core infrastructure. If you cannot guarantee that your vendors follow the same security standards you do, you should not be collecting the data in the first place. For a platform as influential as ChatGPT, the responsibility is even higher. People do not fully understand how many invisible services sit behind a single AI query. They trust the brand they interact with, not the long list of partners behind it.",
      "Attackers can use leaked metadata to craft convincing phishing emails that look legitimate. (Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safer when using AI tools",
      "If you rely on AI tools every day, it's worth tightening your personal security before your data ends up floating around in someone else's analytics dashboard. You cannot control how every vendor handles your information, but you can make it much harder for attackers to target you.",
      "Treat every AI account as if it holds something valuable because it does. Long, unique passwords stored in a reliable password manager reduce the fallout if one platform gets breached. This also protects you from credential stuffing, where attackers try the same password across multiple services.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "AI platforms have become prime targets, so they rely on stronger 2FA. Use an authenticator app or a hardware security key. SMS codes can be intercepted or redirected, which makes them unreliable during large-scale phishing campaigns.",
      "Another important step you can take to protect yourself from phishing attacks is to install strong antivirus software on your devices. This can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping you keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Think twice before pasting private conversations, company documents, medical notes or addresses into a chat window. Many AI tools store recent history for model improvements unless you opt out, and some route data through external vendors. Anything you paste could live on longer than you expect.",
      "Attackers often combine leaked metadata with information they pull from people-search sites and old listings. A good data-removal service scans the web for exposed personal details and submits removal requests on your behalf. Some services even let you send custom links for takedowns. Cleaning up these traces makes targeted phishing and impersonation attacks much harder to pull off.",

      "Events like this show why strengthening your personal security habits matters more than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A lot of attacks succeed because devices run outdated operating systems or browsers. Regular updates close vulnerabilities that could be used to steal session tokens, capture keystrokes or hijack login flows. Updates are boring, but they prevent a surprising amount of trouble.",
      "Old accounts sit around with old passwords and old data, and they become easy targets. If you're not actively using a particular AI tool anymore, delete it from your account list and remove any saved information. It reduces your exposure and limits how many databases contain your details.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This breach may not have touched chat logs or payment details, but it shows how fragile the wider AI ecosystem can be. Your data is only as safe as the least secure partner in the chain.

      "THIS CHROME VPN EXTENSION SECRETLY SPIES ON YOU",
      "Malicious extensions spread through trusted browsers and quietly collected user data for years. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the ShadyPanda campaign unfolded",
      "The operation included 20 malicious Chrome extensions and 125 on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons store. Many first appeared in 2018 with no obvious warning signs. Five years later, the extensions began receiving staged updates that changed their behavior.",
      "Koi Security found that these updates rolled out through each browser's trusted auto-update system. Users did not need to click anything. No phishing. No fake alerts. Just quiet version bumps that slowly turned safe extensions into powerful tracking tools.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "WeTab functions as a sophisticated surveillance platform disguised as a productivity tool. (Koi)",
      "What the extensions were doing behind the scenes",
      "Once activated, the extensions injected tracking code into real links to earn revenue from user purchases. They also hijacked searches, redirected queries and logged data for sale and manipulation. ShadyPanda gathered an unusually broad range of personal information, including browsing history, search terms, cookies, keystrokes, fingerprint data, local storage, and even mouse movement coordinates. As the extensions gained credibility in the stores, the attackers pushed a backdoor update that allowed hourly remote code execution. That gave them full browser control, letting them monitor websites visited and exfiltrate persistent identifiers.",
      "Researchers also discovered that the extensions could launch adversary-in-the-middle attacks. This allowed credential theft, session hijacking and code injection on any website. If users opened developer tools, the extensions switched into harmless mode to avoid detection. Google removed the malicious extensions from the Chrome Web Store. We reached out to the company, and a spokesperson confirmed that none of the extensions listed are currently live on the platform.",
      "Meanwhile, a Microsoft spokesperson told CyberGuy, \"We have removed all the extensions identified as malicious on the Edge Add-on store. When we become aware of instances that violate our policies, we take appropriate action that includes, but is not limited to, the removal of prohibited content or termination of our publishing agreement.\"",
      "Most of you will not need the full technical IDs used in the ShadyPanda campaign. These indicators of compromise are primarily for security researchers and IT teams. Regular users should focus on checking your installed extensions using the steps in the guide below.",

      "You can take a few quick actions that help lock down your browser and protect your data.",
      "Before removing anything, check your installed extensions against the IDs listed in the section above. Most of the malicious extensions were wallpaper or productivity tools. Three of the most mentioned are Clean Master, WeTab and Infinity V Plus. If you installed any of these or anything that looks similar, delete them now.",
      "These extensions have access to sensitive data. Resetting your passwords protects you from possible misuse. A password manager makes the process easier and creates strong passwords for each account.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

A data removal service helps you reclaim your privacy by scanning people-search sites and broker databases to locate your exposed information and remove it. This limits how much of your digital footprint can be linked, sold or used for targeted scams.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "ShadyPanda ran for years without raising alarms and proved how creative attackers can be. A trusted extension can shift into spyware through a silent update, which makes it even more important to stay alert to changes in browser behavior. You protect yourself by installing fewer extensions, checking them from time to time and watching for anything that feels out of place. Small steps help lower your exposure and reduce the chances that hidden code can track what you do online.",

      "How the Call Reason feature works",
      "Call Reason appears inside the Phone by Google app on Android devices. The feature only works when both people use Google's default calling app and the contact is saved in your phone. Many Android phones ship with Phone by Google preinstalled, especially Pixel models, while others like Samsung may use their own dialer instead. If your device does not use Phone by Google by default, you may not see the feature until you install or switch to the Google version. Once marked as urgent, your call displays a clear indicator that tells the other person the conversation should not wait.",

A single donor cornea that can create hundreds of implants changes that equation.",

      "FIRST ON FOX: Senior Israeli intelligence officials say warnings delivered to Australia ahead of a deadly attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach were part of a much broader alert: an accelerating global rise in attempts to execute terror attacks across Western countries, increasingly aimed not only at Jewish targets, but also at Christians and large gatherings especially during religious holidays.",
      "According to a senior Israeli intelligence official, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence service has been tracking a sharp increase in attempted attacks worldwide, many of them low-tech, quickly mobilized and designed to exploit open societies and crowded public events.",

      "\"If you knew how many terror attacks we exposed and prevented,\" the senior official said, \"your jaw would drop.\"",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say the rise in attempted attacks is driven in part by how extremist and state-linked networks build terror infrastructure globally while deliberately masking their origins.",
      "Officials say the networks frequently rely on non-Iranian nationals to carry out different roles along the operational chain, including logistics, intelligence gathering, financing and execution, in order to blur any connection to Tehran. In some cases, operatives are recruited from migrant or refugee backgrounds, while in others criminal elements or hired proxies are used to carry out acts of violence.",

      "To avoid detection, officials say the networks rely on encrypted communications and clandestine in-person meetings, sometimes conducted outside the country where an attack is planned. In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",
      "According to Israeli assessments, extremist networks are increasingly overlapping: jihadist ideology, lone-actor violence and state-linked activity now exist in the same ecosystem, fueled by online radicalization and geopolitical instability. Many plots, officials say, are unsophisticated, making them harder to detect early while still capable of causing mass casualties.",

      "A senior foreign diplomatic source said the current environment is being shaped by what they described as a global contagion effect, in which attacks are amplified online, celebrated across extremist networks and rapidly imitated elsewhere.",

      "The source cautioned that Christian communities and broader civilian gatherings are also vulnerable, particularly during religious holidays and symbolic events that attract large crowds.",
      "This concern has been reflected across Europe in recent weeks, when authorities sharply increased security at Christmas markets and holiday celebrations amid warnings that seasonal events present prime targets for extremist violence.

      "A second senior Israeli intelligence source said the broader threat environment has deteriorated after two years of war in the Middle East, which they said has energized radical Islamist movements globally.",

He spent years in Chile\u2019s congress and previously ran for president in 2017 and 2021 before breaking through in 2025.

Instead, he emphasized structural changes he says are necessary to confront the security crisis, including shrinking parts of the bureaucracy, tightening Chile\u2019s asylum system and giving the presidency greater authority to respond to organized crime.",

      "\"Anything that we could have possibly think of that we thought could hide her face \u2026 was employed.\" Stern said. \"Anything we could think of, her digital signature, her physical signature.

      "The State Department is so far refusing to comment on a growing corruption crisis engulfing the Balkan nation of Albania, a vital U.S. ally in the region.",
      "Following an Albanian court\u2019s decision to remove Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku from her position on allegations she interfered in two construction bids, socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama took the issue to the country\u2019s Constitutional Court, which on Friday reinstated Balluku until a \"final decision\" could be made, according to media reports.",
      "The Special Anti-Corruption and Organized Crime Structure (SPAK) issued a criminal indictment against Balluku on Oct. 31, alleging she had been improperly influenced in her decision to favor one company in a tender for the construction of a 3.7-mile tunnel in southern Albania, Reuters reported. SPAK delivered an additional charge for violating rules in a Tirana road construction project on Nov. 21, the date when Balluku was removed from office.",
      "The day before her November court appearance, Balluku told the country\u2019s parliament the accusations against her amounted to \"mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies.\"",

      "As the second member of Rama\u2019s cabinet to face corruption accusations since 2023, her charges have drawn the ire of Rama opponents.",
      "Agim Nesho, former Albanian ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, told Fox News Digital that Balluku\u2019s case demonstrates \"the Rama government shows no sign of assuming moral responsibility or allowing justice the space to act independently. Instead, it appears intent on shielding Ms. Balluku, portraying the judiciary\u2019s actions as an attack on the executive.\"",
      "Tirana's ex-ambassador to Washington argued that \"influencing the Constitutional Court may be an attempt to set a protective precedent \u2014 one that could prove useful if investigators ever seek to involve Mr. Rama himself in their investigations.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that the emperor has no clothes,\" Nesho said, adding that Rama\u2019s rule has amounted to \"state capture\" as the \"lack of checks and balances has enabled a recurring system of corruption across multiple of his terms.\"",

      "Nesho also claimed that Balluku had pointed to broader involvement of the Rama government in decision-making. Former Deputy Prime Minister Arben Ahmetaj, allegedly on the run after coming under SPAK investigation, has likewise alleged that Rama \"directed all key decisions on tenders, finances and public assets,\" according to Nesho's claims.",
      "Ahmetaj\u2019s accusations included allegations that Rama is involved with mafia bosses. Rama responded to these insinuations by saying Ahmetaj \"should not be taken seriously. Albanian politics is not tainted by the mafia,\" Balkanweb reported.",
      "The U.S. has funded efforts for judicial reforms in Albania to aid its efforts toward accession into the European Union by cutting down on corruption. However, those reforms have led to legal backlogs that have drawn frustration and violence from the public.",
      "Nesho said \"it is hard to see how a government that behaves like a banana republic gains accession to the EU.\" He said, \"Albania is a living contradiction in terms of law and order.\"",
      "While Nesho says Rama\u2019s opposition has been \"decimated by \u2018lawfare\u2019 and the compromising of legal institutions,\" Rama remains in office despite \"documented multibillion-dollar corruption scandals, documented electoral thefts across multiple voting cycles, and, most concerning, documented links to international drug cartels like the Sinaloa Cartel.\"",

(Olsi Shehu/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Allegations that Rama is linked to the Sinaloa Cartel emerged after the prime minister met with Sinaloa-connected Luftar Hysa, who is sanctioned by the U.S. Department of Treasury. Rama told an Albanian news outlet he met with Hysa just once.",
      "With Balluku\u2019s removal, Nesho says \"public anger is directed not only at [her] but also at the irresponsible conduct of a regime that rules without accountability, abuses public property and finances, and faces no consequences despite society\u2019s reaction.\"",
      "Nesho said many in the country have given the prime minister the nickname \"Ramaduro,\" saying it\u2019s \"a direct comparison to the Venezuelan dictator Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 It\u2019s official: House Speaker Mike Johnson says he won\u2019t call a vote to extend enhanced subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, effectively guaranteeing they will expire at the end of this month.",
      "That means higher insurance premiums will go into effect for millions of Americans who get coverage through Obamacare next year.",
      "The speaker made the announcement Tuesday after a closed-door Republican caucus meeting, saying that leadership failed to reach a deal with centrist members to bring up an ACA amendment on a health care bill set for a vote on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s about a dozen members in the conference that are in these swing districts who are fighting hard to make sure they reduce costs for all of their constituents. And many of them did want to vote on this Obamacare Covid-era subsidy that Democrats created,\u201d Johnson, R-La., told reporters. \u201cWe looked for a way to try to allow for that pressure release valve, and it just was not to be. We worked on it all the way through the weekend, in fact. And in the end there was not an agreement \u2014 it wasn\u2019t made.\u201d",
      "As Johnson\u2019s office rolled out the bill Friday, GOP leadership aides said they were working with lawmakers on a path forward for a vote on an amendment to keep the ACA funds flowing.",
      "\u201cI certainly appreciate the views and the opinions of every member of this conference,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut I will tell you: One thing they will all join in unity on is voting for this bill that we\u2019ve been discussing this morning.\u201d",
      "The centrist Republicans who have been pushing for an ACA funding extension include Reps. Jen Kiggans of Virginia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Mike Lawler of New York \u2014 all of whom represent competitive districts that could make or break the Republican majority in the 2026 midterms.",
      "\u201cI am pissed for the American people. This is absolute bulls---, and it\u2019s absurd,\u201d Lawler said Tuesday. \u201cEverybody has a responsibility to serve their district, to serve their constituents. You know what\u2019s funny? Three-quarters of people on Obamacare are in states Donald Trump won. So maybe, just maybe, everybody should look at this and say, \u2018How do we actually fix the health care system?\u2019\u201d",
      "He faulted the leaders of both parties on the issue.",
      "\u201cYou have two leaders that are not serious about solving this problem,\u201d Lawler said, adding that it would be \u201cidiotic\u201d to not hold a vote on the expiring subsidies.",
      "Asked about Lawler\u2019s criticism, Johnson called him \u201ca very dear friend and a close colleague of mine.\u201d",
      "But, he said, other Republicans come from different districts with \u201cdifferent priorities and ideas.\u201d Many Republicans want the funds to expire on schedule.",
      "Another reason the talks broke down is that leaders told the centrist Republicans that they would need to find spending cuts to pay for an ACA funding extension, which is projected to cost about $35 billion per year. That\u2019s a tall order, and one that went over poorly among those GOP members, particularly as party leaders are regularly willing to waive \u201cpay-for\u201d rules on policies they favor.",
      "Some Republicans who want to extend the subsidies have not ruled out signing onto a \u201cdischarge petition\u201d by Democrats to end-run Johnson and force a vote on a clean three-year extension of ACA subsidies.",
      "\u201cAll options are on the table,\u201d Lawler said.",
      "Asked if he\u2019s open to signing the Democrats\u2019 discharge petition, Fitzpatrick said, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about that after today.\u201d",
      "The GOP divisions are likely to empower House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who is insisting on a clean three-year extension with the support of all Democrats. Some Democrats have backed a shorter-term extension with some reforms to win GOP votes, but Jeffries is holding firm.",
      "\u201cThere are 214 Democrats who have signed a discharge petition that would force an up-or-down vote on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits \u2014 to make sure that tens of millions of Americans don\u2019t experience increased health insurance premiums that will prevent them from being able to go see a doctor when they need one,\u201d Jeffries said Monday. \u201cAll we need are four House Republicans to join us.\u201d",
      "Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., who represents a solidly red district, said members like Lawler should remember that other Republicans also have bills they won\u2019t put to a vote.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have everything every time,\u201d Burchett said. \u201cEven though he\u2019s in a district that Kamala Harris won, we can\u2019t just give all the committees and all the bills to the more liberal members of the party.\u201d",
      "Even if a discharge petition secured the votes to pass, which is far from certain, it would take time to reach the House floor. That effectively guarantees it\u2019ll be pushed into next year, with Republicans hoping to adjourn after this week.",
      "Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., who was just re-elected to serve as House Freedom Caucus chairman for another year, said he isn\u2019t worried about his colleagues signing a discharge petition or even passing a bill to extend ACA funds through the House.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s their right as a member to sign a discharge petition. I\u2019m not afraid of a vote on a discharge petition. These will pass in the House, and then they\u2019ll be killed over in the Senate,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s already taken a position on extending the Affordable Care Act to enhance subsidies, and they rejected it.\u201d",
      "Harris added that \u201cit\u2019s possible that we put a package together in January or February\u201d dealing with health care, but he said it must be broader than just addressing ACA enrollees in order to secure his vote.",
      "Asked if he\u2019s worried that moderate Republicans may sign onto Democrats\u2019 discharge petition, Johnson told NBC News, \u201cI don\u2019t worry about anything.\u201d"

      "The United States shed 105,000 jobs in October and added 64,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Tuesday, lifting a monthslong fog that had shrouded the labor market.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.6% in November, the highest since September 2021.",
      "The national employment picture already looked fragile before Tuesday\u2019s report. Jobs reports in June and August showed net job losses, the first time since 2020 that there have been two months of contractions before November.",
      "September\u2019s report, the last one before the government shutdown, showed a more modest increase of 119,000 jobs and a little changed unemployment rate of 4.4%.",
      "Initial payroll data from two recent months was also revised down Tuesday. \u201cEmployment in August and September combined is 33,000 lower than previously reported,\u201d BLS wrote in a news release.",
      "Economists had broadly expected to see net job losses overall in October, followed by a slight rebound and gains in November.",
      "Federal government employment saw \u201c\u200b\u200ba sharp decline of 162,000 in October, as some federal employees who accepted a deferred resignation offer came off federal payrolls,\u201d BLS said.",
      "That program was carried out under the banner of Elon Musk\u2019s now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Since the start of the year, the number of federal government jobs has plunged by 271,000.",
      "Wage growth also appeared sluggish this fall. In November, average hourly earnings rose by just 0.1%. Over the last year, average earnings have increased by 3.5%. But this is only a half-percent more than inflation\u2019s most recent reading in September, meaning the wage growth has had little impact on consumers' purchasing power.",
      "To wit, retail and food services sales totaled $732.6 billion for the month of October, a slight dip from reported sales in September, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Tuesday.",
      "And while total October sales were \u201cvirtually unchanged\u201d from September\u2019s total of $732.4 billion, they rose 3.5% compared to October 2024, the bureau said.",
      "Excluding auto and food sales, however, October retail sales totaled $633.2 billion, which was a slight increase from the previous month.",
      "The next big federal data release will be Thursday, when BLS is set to publish inflation numbers that were also delayed by the shutdown.",
      "During the 43-day shutdown, which ended Nov. 12, BLS employees were unable to collect some key data, so the report released Tuesday does not contain an unemployment rate or labor force participation rate released for October, and some demographic details for the month will remain unknown.",
      "Federal employees notwithstanding, it wasn\u2019t all bad news. In November, the health care sector added 46,000 jobs and construction payrolls rose by 28,000.",
      "The BLS specifically said that 19,000 of those building jobs were for what it called \u201cnonresidential specialty trade contractors,\" which could potentially mean AI data centers.",
      "Job losses mounted in the transportation and warehousing sectors, however, led by a loss of more than 18,000 workers classified as couriers or messengers.",
      "The leisure and hospitality industry shrank by 12,000 roles in November, which could be another warning sign for the economy.",
      "ADP\u2019s chief economist Nela Richardson warned in early November that a slowdown in the industry was \u201cthe most concerning trend\u201d to her. \u201cThat points swiftly back to the consumer and how healthy and resilient the consumer will be,\u201d she said.",
      "Other industries showed few signs of growth, including the manufacturing, retail trade, information and financial sectors.",
      "Stock futures traded fairly flat after the data was released. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had already downplayed the delayed datapoint\u2019s importance last week, calling it potentially \u201cdistorted.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the administration's accusations against New York Attorney General Letitia James \"might\" be \"retribution,\" and \"when there\u2019s an opportunity\" for President Donald Trump to take retribution, \"he will go for it,\" Vanity Fair reported in a new profile of Wiles.",
      "Vanity Fair published the two-part profile on Tuesday based on a wide-ranging series of 11 interviews over the course of a year with Wiles, who rarely grants public interviews and generally stays out of the spotlight. The profile provides a rare look into the mindset of one of the most powerful people in the White House.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wiles \"has helped President Trump achieve the most successful first 11 months in office of any President in American history.\"",
      "\"President Trump has no greater or more loyal advisor than Susie,\" Leavitt said in the statement. \"The entire Administration is grateful for her steady leadership and united fully behind her.\"",
      "Wiles also rebuked Vanity Fair's reporting in a post to X, calling it \"a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest President, White House staff, and Cabinet in history.\"",
      "\"Significant context was disregarded and much of what I, and others, said about the team and the President was left out of the story,\" she said. \"I assume, after reading it, that this was done to paint an overwhelmingly chaotic and negative narrative about the President and our team.\"",
      "Trump told the New York Post that while he didn\u2019t read the Vanity Fair article, Wiles has \u201cdone a fantastic job\u201d and he has full confidence in her.",
      "\u201cI think from what I hear, the facts were wrong, and it was a very misguided interviewer, purposely misguided,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Reached for comment, the Justice Department pointed to Wiles' post and the White House's response.",
      "In a March interview with the publication, published as part of Tuesday's profile, the reporter asked Wiles whether she has ever told Trump \"this is not supposed to be a retribution tour,\" referring to the administration's early actions against those whom the president has viewed as his enemies.",
      "\u201cYes, I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have a loose agreement that the score settling will end before the first 90 days are over.\u201d",
      "Asked in August about the end of a \"retribution tour\" after 90 days, Wiles told the publication: \"I don't think he's on a retribution tour. A governing principle for him is, \u2018I don\u2019t want what happened to me to happen to somebody else.\u2019 And so people that have done bad things need to get out of the government. In some cases, it may look like retribution. And there may be an element of that from time to time. Who would blame him? Not me.\"",
      "The Trump administration tried to bring charges against James and former FBI Director James Comey, both Trump critics who had mounted investigations centered around the president, with Comey initially looking into potential links between Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and James securing a more than half-billion-dollar civil fraud judgment against Trump and his family business that was overturned on appeal last summer.",
      "But last month, a federal judge dismissed the indictments against James, who was charged with mortgage fraud, and Comey, who was indicted on charges related to congressional testimony he gave in 2020, after the judge found the prosecutor who pursued both cases had been unlawfully appointed.",
      "The Justice Department then failed successive attempts to secure an indictment against James after the original case was dismissed, although prosecutors could try to indict James again. NBC News reported earlier this month that a source familiar with the matter said there \u201cshould be no premature celebrations\u201d related to the case. The department doesn't comment on grand jury matters.",
      "Before those charges were brought, Trump publicly pressured Attorney General Pam Bondi in a Truth Social post to prosecute Comey, James and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., calling them \"all guilty as hell,\" in what was reportedly meant to be a private message, and his critics have repeatedly criticized him for targeting those he sees as political foes.",
      "Asked by Vanity Fair about the administration's accusation of mortgage fraud against James, Wiles reportedly said, \u201cWell, that might be the one retribution.\u201d",
      "Pressed by the publication on whether she challenged Trump on the allegations against James, Wiles said, \"No, no, not on her.\"",
      "\"Not on her. She had a half a billion dollars of his money!\" she said, laughing, Vanity Fair reported.",
      "When asked, Wiles said of the Comey prosecution: \u201cI mean, people could think it does look vindictive. I can\u2019t tell you why you shouldn\u2019t think that.\u201d",
      "\"I don\u2019t think he wakes up thinking about retribution,\" she continued. \"But when there\u2019s an opportunity, he will go for it.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, James' attorney Abbe Lowell  said that Wiles was \"admitting that President Trump turned the Justice Department into his weapon for political retribution against Attorney General Letitia James only confirms that this has been an improper vindictive prosecution.\"",
      "\"It all proves beyond any doubt that the attempts to bring charges against Attorney General James are nothing more than Trump\u2019s political crusade,\" he added. \"When they admit it\u2019s not justice they\u2019re after but pure revenge, believe them.\""

      "Many stood silently beneath the waning moon, police helicopters  whirring overhead. Some laid bouquets of flowers, which local stores were giving out for free. All were there to pay tribute to the 15 people killed at a Hanukkah celebration on Sunday.",
      "The beach, a worldwide symbol of a free-wheeling iconically Australian way of life, serves as the nation's spiritual backyard, and the massacre has sent ripples of shock and grief through Sydney and the nation.",
      "The attack, which authorities say is an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State ideology, \u201cwas targeted at the Jewish community, but Bondi Beach is open and a place for everyone,\u201d Rabbi Alon Meltzer told NBC News on Tuesday as he headed to the coroner\u2019s office to sit with the bodies of those slain.",
      "\u201cSo many people will be living in trauma,\u201d he said.",
      "Kyle Korus, 15, said he was with a group of friends when the shooters opened fire and they took cover behind a piece of concrete.",
      "\u201cI look to my left, there is this guy on the floor, his head split open, his brain on the floor, there\u2019s blood everywhere,\u201d he said, adding that when they saw the police had the situation under control, they ran back to help.",
      "The fear was still palpable for Bianca Hirschowitz, whose 15-year-old son, Noah, had gone to the beach with Kyle, something she said they did almost daily, whether it be to meet friends, go swimming or grab an ice cream.",
      "Alerted to the attack by her sister, she said she raced down to the beach after a tracking app showed that Noah was at a pavilion there.",
      "She said she spotted one gunmen on a bridge near the beach but did not fully clock the danger until she saw two bodies covered in white sheets, and another man lying face down.",
      "\u201cThere were grown men screaming, children crying,\u201d she said.",
      "While she \u201cjust wanted to get to my son,\u201d Hirschowitz said she couldn\u2019t find Noah for around an hour and he was not answering his phone.",
      "\u201cI was screaming for him, hoping that he would answer,\u201d she said. The more he didn\u2019t answer, the more her fear grew.",
      "Eventually Hirschowitz got through to Noah on the phone, only to find he had returned home.",
      "\u201cI hugged him and I held him very, very tight, and I just said we thought you had died,\u201d she said of their reunion.",
      "The attack has set off renewed scrutiny of not only Australian gun laws and efforts to combat antisemitism, but also what authorities knew about the two men accused of carrying out the attack.",
      "Three senior law enforcement officials in the U.S. and Australia told NBC News that investigators had tentatively identified one of the suspects as Naveed Akram, 24. New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon identified the other as Sajid Akram, 50, Naveed's father.",
      "Police have said officers fatally shot the father at the scene, while the son \u201csuffered critical injuries\u201d and was hospitalized.",
      "\u201cEarly indications point to a terrorism attack inspired by the Islamic State,\u201d Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters Tuesday, while Lanyon said two homemade  flags of the terrorist group were found in cars belonging to the younger suspect.",
      "While antisemitic incidents had been on the rise in Australia, survivors say that an attack of this scale was largely unfathomable, given the stringent gun control laws in Australia.",
      "Hirschowitz said she had moved from South Africa seeking a life of \u201cstability and security,\u201d and that was the case for many years \u2014  until Sunday.",
      "\u201cIf Australia is for everybody, we should be able to celebrate our own celebrations in peace,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are afraid to go to their house of worship.\"",
      "Meltzer, the rabbi, echoed her comments and said some of his colleagues and friends were among those killed.",
      "\u201cWe need more than just sympathy and empathy,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need real action.\u201d",

      "Reiner, the son of comedy icon Carl Reiner, rose to fame in the 1970s on \u201cAll in the Family\u201d before making his mark as a filmmaker. He leaves behind a roster of movies that have entertained and moved fans for decades.",
      "Reiner also had an ability to showcase undiscovered, young talent. Robin Wright made her film debut in 1987's \u201cThe Princess Bride,\u201d which also starred Fred Savage before viewers were introduced to him in 1988 in \u201cThe Wonder Years.\u201d \u201cStand by Me,\u201d released in 1986, featured Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'Connell, Kiefer Sutherland and John Cusack before they were household names.

He was an extraordinary director and the impact he had on me has stayed with me throughout my career. My heart goes out to his family and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time.\u201d",

He told us stories about the strength of the human spirit, and he made us laugh. Oh, how he made us laugh.\u201d",

      "But one of his recent videos caught the attention of over 100,000 social media users, including Kardashian. Myers shared a clip of him posing in his classroom. Text over the video included some facts about him, like his Italian roots and past life as a collegiate athlete. In the caption, he wrote, \u201cSomewhere out there is the woman who\u2019s gonna ask how my school day was.\u201d",
      "Kardashian decided to be the one to pose the pivotal question, writing \u201cHow was your day??\u201d in the comments. Her reply received over 80,000 likes and Instagram users immediately chimed in, suggesting that the two meet. Even Kardashian\u2019s close friend Malika Haqq encouraged the potential connection. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the sweetest,\u201d she asked the high school teacher and coach, playing wing woman for her bestie.",
      "Myers left a flirtatious reply: \u201cMine is great now. How was yours?\u201d Then he uploaded a follow-up video, also filmed in his classroom, giving Kardashian a longer response. He shared that he was interested in meeting up in person and pitched being her plus-one to a Kardashian Christmas party.",
      "He tagged Kardashian, Haqq and momager Kris Jenner in the post. \u201cThis is your sign to help a teacher out and tag @khloekardashian. Shooters gotta shoot,\u201d he playfully wrote in the caption.",
      "Myers tells TODAY.com that he decided to post the initial video on a whim when he was preparing for final exams and feeling swamped. He couldn\u2019t have imagined the amount of replies he received.",
      "\u201c(I) honestly never expected the attention. It\u2019s been very overwhelming and exciting at the same time, because I just post the videos for the fun of them,\u201d he shares. \u201cMy students are kind of my main priority. I\u2019m a teacher first and foremost.\u201d",
      "His students were the ones who encouraged him to start using his social media to post about his job.",
      "\u201cThey were like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you make Tiktok videos?\u2019\u201d he recalls them asking. They showed him other TikTokers who are teachers and he realized how many other educators can relate to his experience.",
      "He continues, \u201cI started to create content, and I ended up finding a community of teachers out there that were going through the same things. Just being stressed out as a teacher, but still enjoying it, and I was able to talk to them. Then it ended up creating a little support group in a way. Also, we\u2019re able to trade lesson plans and info. It\u2019s been a huge help to talk with teachers from around the world and connect with them.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou never get that many opportunities in my world,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not? What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019\u201d",
      "After his interaction with the reality television star, his students, and co-workers, began teasing him that he was all over their For You Pages. He says during a school rally students gave gifts to all the teachers. They presented Myers with a Photoshopped picture of him and Kardashian.",
      "He doesn\u2019t mind the \"overwhelming\" attention or his students poking fun at him. But he says he hopes that his other videos resonate with people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known (as) the teacher that asked out Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. I\u2019d rather be known as a great teacher and a great coach, which I think I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my passion.\u201d",
      "Myers, who has nearly 90,000 followers on Instagram now, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting opportunity for me to actually shine a light on education and show people what I teach. There\u2019s a lot of other teachers out there that don\u2019t post and you don\u2019t actually see what they do. And there\u2019s a lot of other teachers that are just like me, who are teaching three different subjects and coaching multiple sports and running programs.\u201d",

    "summary": "Here's what you need to know about the often-sung but rarely defined foods in Christmas songs, like figgy pudding, wassail, sugar plums and roasted chestnuts.",
    "story": [
      "Wassail might be \u201call over the town\u201d this month, but what is it, exactly?",
      "Every holiday season, carolers sing about drinking eggnog by the fire like Medieval people did, or indulging in a holiday punch or Christmas goose like any of a number of Victorian families, all of which many modern folk still enjoy.",
      "However, some songs blaring over shopping mall speakers or the sound systems of holiday-themed bars make us wonder: What the heck is wassail? Why don\u2019t we still eat sugar plums and roasted chestnuts?",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, what is figgy pudding and why does Bing Crosby want it so badly?",
      "Figgy Pudding (\u2018We Wish You a Merry Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cNow, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here\u201d",
      "Merry modern revelers sing this song without knowing that \u201cfiggy pudding\u201d historically did not contain figs, as it was a misinterpretation of a British holiday classic \u2014 plum pudding \u2014 which is not a pudding in the American sense, but a dense, boiled dessert.",
      "The dish that became figgy pudding was originally more on the savory side, with preserved, sweetened meat and boiled vegetables, but eventually included prunes. Also, the word \u201cplum\u201d eventually became a label for all dried fruits, confusing the issue further.",
      "While stateside bakers don\u2019t traditionally prepare this complex treat for the holidays, save for brave souls like YouTubers Tyler Williams and Safiya Nygaard in 2022, it is still regularly sold in British stores.",
      "A version of figgy pudding being sold at luxury department store Harrods features sultanas, raisins, demerara sugar, pitted plums, figs \u2014 unlike its historical predecessor \u2014 and a butterscotch sauce, for $24.",
      "Sugar Plums (\u2018\u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads\u201d",
      "Interestingly, the history of figgy pudding and sugar plums are related since they both use the word \u201cplum\u201d to refer to fruit or dessert.",
      "A sugar plum is a sugar-coated candy popular in Victorian times which often had a dried fruit like a cherry or fig or nut in the center. Not a plum at all, its name referred to its size and shape.",
      "In 2024, YouTuber Max Miller of Tasting History made sugar plums the traditional way and discovered how time-consuming it is to roll a nut in layer after layer of warm sugar until it becomes candy-coated.",
      "This might be why sugar plums live in the lyrics of this Christmas ditty and not actually in our modern tradition.",
      "Cup of Cheer (\u2018A Holly Jolly Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cHave a cup of cheer\u201d",
      "While a cup that makes you cheerful these days may be a strong cocktail made by Sam Heughan, the term doesn\u2019t only mean adult beverages in vintage Christmas lyricism. A \u201ccup of cheer\u201d can also refer to hot cocoa.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Wassail (\u2018Gloucestershire Wassail,\u2019 \u2018Here We Come A-Wassailing\u2019 and More)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWassail! Wassail all over the town!\u201d",
      "The term wassail has an olde English history: The hot mulled punch, which often consists of cider, wine or ale with winter spices, comes from the words \u201cwaes hael\u201d which means \u201cbe healthy.\u201d",
      "The term is also also a verb: Back in olden times, groups of revelers went door-to-door wassailing with a wassailing bowl, offering sips of drink from it for gifts at each home they visited. This tradition may seem familiar because it\u2019s actually where Christmas caroling comes from.",
      "Roasted Chestnuts (\u2018The Christmas Song\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cChestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d",
      "The opener to Nat King Cole\u2019s classic rendition of \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d features a once-abundant treat enjoyed by early Americans during the holidays. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnuts were one of the most popular ingredients in early American food because of the preponderance of Chestnut trees speckling the East Coast at the time.",
      "For this Christmas tradition, a roasted chestnut has a soft texture and some say it tastes mild and sweet with a fluffy or potato-like texture \u2014 though one social media user who isn\u2019t a fan claims they have a \u201cmealy\u201d texture.",
      "Sadly, in 1904, a fungal disease tore through chestnut tree populations in the U.S., causing them to almost go extinct and fall out of favor as a traditional treat as a result, although countries like Turkey and Italy still feature the glossy brown nut during the holidays."

      "\u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d (1984)",
      "The term \u201cmockumentary\u201d is common now, but it was a novel concept when Reiner helmed this comedy classic chronicling a British heavy metal band\u2019s disastrous tour. It was so groundbreaking that fans may have actually believed the group, portrayed by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, was real when it was pure fiction.",
      "\u201cThis Is Spinal Tap\u201d marked Reiner\u2019s big-screen directorial debut. In addition, he starred as Marty DiBergi, the filmmaker who follows the band. Reiner also directed the long-awaited sequel that came out earlier this year.",

The movie scored four Oscar nominations, including best picture.",

      "\u201cAnd I think in many ways the Rob Reiner Meathead character was the way in for the audience. He was the new member of family, if you will. And I think Rob Reiner even understood what an important role, iconic role that was,\" Karger added. \"At one point, he said, \u2018If I ever won the Nobel Prize, the headline would say, \u201cMeathead Wins Nobel.\u201d\u2019 That was really a role and a character that is going to last for decades to come.\u201d",
      "Reiner made a successful transition from actor to director after \u201cAll in the Family\u201d and would go on to help bring to life other movies and shows that fans may not realize he had a hand in developing.",
      "\u201cHe was one of the founders of Castle Rock Entertainment, which has been a real big player in the entertainment business, not only producing his own movies, but other directors\u2019 movies like \u2018The Shawshank Redemption,\u2019\u201d Karger said.",
      "\u201cHe even had a hand in producing \u2018Seinfeld,\u2019\" he added. \"So, Rob Reiner, whether people knew it or not, was behind so many of all of our favorite TV shows and movies, for years and years.\""

      "TODAY lifestyle contributor Jill Martin ventured to Venice to chat about Season 5 with Collins and her onscreen and real life friend, Ashley Park, who plays Mindy.",
      "Among the topics of their talk? What inspired the sudden strand switch-up for Collins' character.",
      "\"So did Emily get the bob, or did Lily get the bob?\" Martin asked in a segment that will air on TODAY on Dec. 15.",
      "\"Lily got the bob,\" Collins clarified. \"Usually Lily gets the haircuts first, and then Marylin (Fitoussi, the show's costume designer) is inspired by the haircuts to create the new wardrobe for the next season. And then I always go to Darren (Star, the show's creator) and I'm like, 'Hey, can I keep it?'\"",
      "Throughout the series, which returns for Season 5 on Dec. 18, Emily has rarely strayed from her signature long, brunette locks. Except, of course, that time she decided to cut her own bangs in the Season 3 premiere.",
      "As it turns out, this was another case of art imitating life for Collins.",
      "\"In the season with the bangs, we created part of the storyline, you know, Ashley coming in, and being like, 'No!'\" the actor said.",
      "\"Trauma bangs,\" Park noted.",
      "Collins' real-life bob was a bit more of a dramatic mane move than getting bangs. She told Jill it's a style she wouldn't have considered sporting earlier in her life. But her hairstylist, Gregory Russell, convinced her to try it, since he'd always wanted to see her with shorter hair.",
      "\u201cI really love changing my hair, which is ironic, because growing up, I was like, \u2018I never want to cut or color my hair.\u2019 And so I did it, and I didn\u2019t know how people would react. I was like, \u2018Is there going to have to be a wig next season or whatever?'\" she recalled.",
      "Luckily, Star was down to keep the hairstyle, and the duo proceeded to debate if they should write it into the show.",
      "\u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Well, we already did that with the bangs.\u2019 So there was one moment, I believe it was cut (from the show) but there was a moment in the very first episode when I go into the Rome office and I sit down. Philippine (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, who plays Sylvie) comes in, and the first thing she says is, \u2018You cut your hair.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, thanks.\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s not a compliment. We\u2019ve gotta go,\u2019\u201d she remembered.",
      "Park wanted to make sure the merits of Collins' haircut were acknowledged so she improvised a bit while filming.",
      "\u201cI added a line. Because when Mindy comes to Rome, I remember being like, \u2018Wait, hold up. I know that Lily got this haircut, but I feel like Mindy would at least be, like, \u2018Love your hair!\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Martin was also curious to know if becoming a mother inspired Collins' new shorter hairstyle. In January 2025, Collins announced that she had welcomed her first child with her husband Charlie McDowell.",
      "\"No, it didn\u2019t. I always wanted to do it. I had a very short haircut when I was 25 and then it grew out. But then I just kept it growing. No, it is more practical, perhaps,\" she said.",
      "Regardless of her motivation for chopping her hair, the end result is fabulous, if you ask Park.",

      "So Swift is hopefully forgiven for what she wore the first day of rehearsals.",
      "Per footage in the first episode of \u201cThe End of an Era,\u201d Swift arrived to the first rehearsal of the tour wearing a grey Philadelphia Eagles sweatshirt.",
      "The Eagles are one of the Kansas City Chiefs known rivals in recent sports history, having met at the Super Bowl in 2023 and again in 2025.",
      "Swift and Kelce, tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, have been dating since at least September 2023, when she appeared at Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Chicago Bears.",
      "But the \u201cEras Tour\u201d \u2014 and all the preparation required for it \u2014 massively predates their relationship. (In fact, Kelce attending the \u201cEras Tour\u201d in July 2023 led to them meeting in the first place, after a missed friendship bracelet connection.)",
      "Before she started dating Kelce, Swift, who was born in Pennsylvania, had previously alluded to her love of the Philly team. In her 2020 song \u201cGold Rush,\u201d she briefly sings about her \u201cEagles T-shirt hanging from the door.\u201d Then, amid speculation that the lyric could refer to the team or the \u201cHotel California\u201d band, Swift said onstage in Philadelphia in May 2023, \u201cGuys, like, c\u2019mon. I\u2019m from Philly. Of course it\u2019s the team.\u201d",
      "In the docuseries, Swift is seen wearing an Eagles sweatshirt in multiple clips from that rehearsal.",
      "As she arrived at the rehearsal space, she already had tears in her eyes. While shaking the hand of one of her fellow performers, she said, \u201cI\u2019m weirdly emotional right now. It\u2019s so nice to meet you, I\u2019m Taylor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen the boss come into rehearsal crying with tears of happiness and passion about their job,\u201d dancer Whyley Yoshimura said about the moment.",
      "The \u201cEras Tour\u201d went on to kick off just weeks after her then-beloved Eagles lost to the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. That matchup made headlines for being the first Super Bowl to see two brothers \u2014 you guessed it, Travis and his brother, Jason Kelce \u2014 face off on opposing teams.",
      "Unfortunately for Philly fans, by the 2025 Super Bowl, when the Eagles got their revenge and defeated the Chiefs 40-22, Swift had already switched allegiances, proudly supporting Travis Kelce.",
      "Regarding football, she has since said, \u201cThe whole season I am locked in on what that man is doing on the field.\u201d",
      "Jason Kelce, Travis Kelce\u2019s brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center, has yet to comment on the sweatshirt\u2019s appearance."

      "SYDNEY \u2014 Hundreds remained on Bondi Beach long after the sun had set Tuesday.",
      "Many stood silently beneath the waning moon, police helicopters  whirring overhead. Some laid bouquets of flowers, which local stores were giving out for free. All were there to pay tribute to the 15 people killed at a Hanukkah celebration on Sunday.",
      "The beach, a worldwide symbol of a free-wheeling iconically Australian way of life, serves as the nation's spiritual backyard, and the massacre has sent ripples of shock and grief through Sydney and the nation.",
      "The attack, which authorities say is an act of terrorism inspired by Islamic State ideology, \u201cwas targeted at the Jewish community, but Bondi Beach is open and a place for everyone,\u201d Rabbi Alon Meltzer told NBC News on Tuesday as he headed to the coroner\u2019s office to sit with the bodies of those slain.",
      "\u201cSo many people will be living in trauma,\u201d he said.",
      "Kyle Korus, 15, said he was with a group of friends when the shooters opened fire and they took cover behind a piece of concrete.",
      "\u201cI look to my left, there is this guy on the floor, his head split open, his brain on the floor, there\u2019s blood everywhere,\u201d he said, adding that when they saw the police had the situation under control, they ran back to help.",
      "The fear was still palpable for Bianca Hirschowitz, whose 15-year-old son, Noah, had gone to the beach with Kyle, something she said they did almost daily, whether it be to meet friends, go swimming or grab an ice cream.",
      "Alerted to the attack by her sister, she said she raced down to the beach after a tracking app showed that Noah was at a pavilion there.",
      "She said she spotted one gunmen on a bridge near the beach but did not fully clock the danger until she saw two bodies covered in white sheets, and another man lying face down.",
      "\u201cThere were grown men screaming, children crying,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI was screaming for him, hoping that he would answer,\u201d she said. The more he didn\u2019t answer, the more her fear grew.",
      "Eventually Hirschowitz got through to Noah on the phone, only to find he had returned home.",
      "\u201cI hugged him and I held him very, very tight, and I just said we thought you had died,\u201d she said of their reunion.",
      "The attack has set off renewed scrutiny of not only Australian gun laws and efforts to combat antisemitism, but also what authorities knew about the two men accused of carrying out the attack.",
      "Three senior law enforcement officials in the U.S. and Australia told NBC News that investigators had tentatively identified one of the suspects as Naveed Akram, 24. New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon identified the other as Sajid Akram, 50, Naveed's father.",
      "Police have said officers fatally shot the father at the scene, while the son \u201csuffered critical injuries\u201d and was hospitalized.",
      "\u201cEarly indications point to a terrorism attack inspired by the Islamic State,\u201d Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett told reporters Tuesday, while Lanyon said two homemade  flags of the terrorist group were found in cars belonging to the younger suspect.",
      "While antisemitic incidents had been on the rise in Australia, survivors say that an attack of this scale was largely unfathomable, given the stringent gun control laws in Australia.",
      "Hirschowitz said she had moved from South Africa seeking a life of \u201cstability and security,\u201d and that was the case for many years \u2014  until Sunday.",

      "President Donald Trump says that Russia and Ukraine are closer to peace than they have ever been.",
      "Days of intense negotiations ended with the United States, Ukraine and Europe hailing significant progress as Trump pushes for a deal to end the Kremlin's war by Christmas.",
      "Washington and Kyiv appear to have made notable shifts to secure progress but huge questions remain, not least whether Moscow will once again flatly reject the idea of making any significant concessions.",
      "And while the U.S. has now offered Ukraine the robust security guarantees it has long sought, the fate of key territory on the conflict\u2019s eastern front lines remains pivotal, yet unresolved.",
      "After meetings with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and European leaders in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that Kyiv had now been offered an equivalent of NATO\u2019s Article 5 deterrence mechanism, under which an attack on one member is considered an attack on them all.",
      "This guarantee would be legally binding, he said, voted on and approved by the U.S. Congress.",
      "Zelenskyy said the latest draft was not \"perfect\" but was \"very workable.\" He abandoned Ukraine's long-held ambition of joining NATO over the weekend, ahead of the talks.",
      "These guarantees are \"the biggest win so far for Ukraine and for Europe,\" a U.S. official told reporters, warning that they \u201cwill not be on the table forever.\u201d The official added that they believe Russia will accept it in a final deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has maintained that any deal would need to provide concrete security guarantees to prevent future attacks by Russia. It\u2019s a historically sensitive issue for Kyiv since Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, meant to guarantee Ukraine's post-Soviet sovereignty in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.",
      "European leaders suggested their countries could lead a \u201cmultinational force\u201d supported by the U.S. that would \u201cassist in the regeneration of Ukraine\u2019s forces, in securing Ukraine\u2019s skies, and in supporting safer seas,\u201d alongside a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring, verification and deconfliction mechanism.",
      "All of this was discussed on a call with Trump, Zelenskyy said, and the American leader appeared happy with the progress.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re closer now than we have been ever,\u201d Trump said Monday.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to NBC News request for further comment on the status of the talks.",
      "But the Kremlin is unlikely to share in the enthusiasm.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s highly unlikely that Putin will buy into this,\u201d said Christopher Tuck, an expert in conflict and security at King\u2019s College London. \u201cThe draft agreement includes clauses that stand in diametric opposition to policy statements made repeatedly by Russia on what it regards as an acceptable basis for resolving the conflict.\u201d",
      "The multinational force is \u201ca clear red line for Putin,\u201d said John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a London/Washington-based think tank focused on Russia. The Kremlin will also reject the idea of a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, he said, and will likely ask for restrictions on the kinds of weapons systems available to Kyiv\u2019s forces.",
      "Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told ABC News on Monday that while he thinks Russia and the U.S. might be \u201con the verge\u201d of a deal, the agreement can\u2019t include the presence of foreign troops in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cSo this is likely to go a few more rounds,\u201d Lough said.",
      "And still to be worked out is the future of eastern Ukraine.",
      "Putin insists Russia is winning on the battlefield, giving him no incentive to negotiate what he thinks he can achieve by force.",
      "He wants Ukraine to give up its entire Donbas region, even though Kyiv's forces still control a part of it and it is something Zelenskyy has said he will never do.",
      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Trump has insisted that Ukraine would have to cede territory, but it's unclear how this compromise would work or whether the Kremlin would give it the time of day.",
      "A U.S. official said they had given Zelenskyy some \"thought-provoking ideas,\" and that they would speak with Russia and Europe about them after his response. Zelenskyy said the U.S. would take the new draft to Russia in the coming days.",
      "Asked if any of the security guarantees floated Monday were unacceptable to the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had yet to see any updated agreements. He reiterated that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a short-term ceasefire over Christmas as Kyiv has suggested.",
      "\u201cWe want peace. We don\u2019t want a truce to give Ukraine a breathing space and prepare for a continuation of the war,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "But while the Kremlin is likely to stonewall the newest agreements, Tuck said, the proposed security guarantees put pressure on Russia by implying a growing consensus between Ukraine and the West on what a peace agreement should look like.",
      "\u201cThe agreement isn\u2019t nothing, we aren\u2019t back to square one: the statement does indicate a more united front by the West, and getting the U.S. to commit, even in general and early terms, to providing some form of security guarantees is a significant development,\u201d Tuck said."

    "story": [
      "Rough seas. An almost moonless night. And a small fishing boat crossing a treacherous stretch of the Caribbean Sea, carrying precious cargo with a target on her back.",
      "Those were the conditions that Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado faced when she made perhaps the most perilous part of her journey to collect her Nobel Peace Prize in Norway, according to the U.S. Special Forces veteran who planned and aided her escape.",
      "\u201cThere were 5- to 6-foot waves, maybe even bigger waves than that, and we were doing this in the middle of the night,\u201d Bryan Stern, who heads the Tampa, Florida-based Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, told NBC News. \u201cIt was pitch black, almost no moonlight. All of us were very cold and wet.\u201d",
      "But Machado never lost her composure, or her lunch, Stern said, as the skiff lurched in the rough sea and plied through waters that have been targeted, of late, by the U.S. missile strikes on suspected drug smuggling boats.",
      "\u201cShe did fine,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThey call her the Iron Lady for a reason.\u201d",
      "Stern dubbed the extrication operation: \u201cOperation Golden Dynamite.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is overwhelmingly the highest-profile person we\u2019ve rescued,\u201d said Stern, who noted this was the 800th mission his organization carried out.",
      "Machado, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in October for leading the opposition against Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s regime, said on Thursday that she got help from the U.S. government to leave her hiding place in Venezuela and collect her award.",
      "Stern insisted the operation was paid for \u201cby a series of unnamed donors,\u201d and the U.S. government was aware of what was going on but not directly involved.",
      "\u201cWe designed and implemented the extrication of Mar\u00eda Corina Machado from Venezuela to a friendly country from which she was flown to her next destination,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe were not hired by anyone in the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "In fact, Stern added, \u201cI\u2019ve never received a thank-you note, let alone a dollar, from the U.S. government.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to an email from NBC News seeking information about its possible involvement in Machado\u2019s escape.",
      "Stern said he began planning the mission on Dec. 5.",
      "\u201cWe really wanted to get her to the Nobel prize ceremony on time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there were a number of obstacles.\u201d",
      "Getting Machado out of Venezuela required disguising her appearance. Stern did not say exactly what they did to get her out and wouldn\u2019t comment on a Wall Street Journal account that she, at some point, donned a wig.",
      "\u201cHer face was a problem because she is the most famous person in Venezuela outside of Maduro,\u201d he said, noting that there are billboards with Machado\u2019s image everywhere in Venezuela.",
      "The Maduro regime was using Machado\u2019s facial biometrics to try to locate her, he said.",
      "\u201cPeople in the Maduro regime call it the \u2018Hunt for Maria\u2019 the way we would talk about the \u2018Hunt for Bin Laden\u2019,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe had to use a lot of deception, even with some members of her own team.\u201d",
      "Stern said he met Machado for the first time on Tuesday evening. He would not say exactly when or where he rendezvoused with Machado, but it involved her taking a small skiff from a fishing village and transferring her at sea to the somewhat bigger fishing boat that he was on.",
      "\u201cI was on the second leg of the operation,\u201d he said. \u201cI got very close to Venezuela.\u201d",
      "But Machado\u2019s departure, which was supposed to happen Tuesday morning, was delayed till evening by a broken engine, he said. And what should have been a three or four-hour trip turned into a roughly 16-hour ordeal.",
      "\u201cI first met her at sea,\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe used a fishing boat to get her to her flight.\u201d",
      "Stern said the flight took off from Cura\u00e7ao, which is about 40 miles north of Venezuela and is a self-governing island that is part of the Netherlands.",
      "\u201cI would say we transited through Cura\u00e7ao,\u201d Stern said. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t in Cura\u00e7ao. She never cleared immigration in Cura\u00e7ao.\u201d",
      "Stern said this was the most challenging mission he and his group have undertaken. As for Machado, Stern said he\u2019s a big fan.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll admit I\u2019m starstruck,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a hero of mine.\u201d"

      "With climate change steadily dismantling the icy habitat essential to their existence, new research suggests polar bears are rapidly rewiring their own genetics in a bid to survive.",
      "The species is being forced to adapt to the harsher reality of a warming Arctic, in what scientists believe is the first documented case of rising temperatures driving genetic change in a mammal.",
      "Researchers from the University of East Anglia in Britain say these findings, published Friday in the journal Mobile DNA, offer a rare glimmer of hope for the species.",
      "\"Polar bears are still sadly expected to go extinct this century, with two-thirds of the population gone by 2050,\" Alice Godden, who is the lead author of the study, told NBC News.",
      "\"I believe our work really does offer a glimmer of hope \u2014 a window of opportunity for us to reduce our carbon emissions to slow down the rate of climate change and to give these bears more time to adapt to these stark changes in their habitats.\"",
      "Building on earlier University of Washington research, Godden\u2019s team analyzed blood samples from polar bears in northeastern and southeastern Greenland. In the slightly warmer south, they found that genes linked to heat stress, aging and metabolism behaved differently from those in northern bears.",
      "\u201cEssentially this means that different groups of bears are having different sections of their DNA changed at different rates, and this activity seems linked to their specific environment and climate,\" Godden said in a university press release.",
      "She said this shows, for the first time, that a unique group of one species has been forced to \"rewrite their own DNA,\" adding that this process can be considered \"a desperate survival mechanism against melting sea ice.\"",
      "The Arctic Ocean has repeatedly experienced record-high temperatures in the past few years, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) monitoring data shows.",
      "Researchers say warming ocean temperatures have reduced vital sea ice platforms that the bears use to hunt seals, leading to isolation and food scarcity.",
      "This led to genetic changes as the animals\u2019 digestive system adapts to a diet of plants and low fats in the absence of prey, Godden told NBC News.",
      "\"Food availability is a real problem for these bears \u2014 everywhere, but most prominently in the south,\" she said. \"This may suggest their body shape and composition is also changing in response to their warmer environments.\"",
      "The lead researcher said that her team decided to focus on the southern group of bears because the area's warmer climate serves as a glimpse of what is to come for other bear populations later this century if current trends in climate change continue.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates there are currently about 26,000 polar bears worldwide. Scientifically known by its Latin name Ursus maritimus, meaning \"sea bear,\" the animals are listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, meaning they are considered to be facing \"a high risk of extinction in the wild.\"",
      "The study \"does not mean that polar bears are at any less risk of extinction,\u201d Godden said, though the discovery may \u201cprovide a genetic blueprint for how polar bears might be able to adapt quickly to climate change.\u201d",
      "Godden added: \"We all must do more to mitigate our carbon emissions to help provide and extend this window of opportunity to help save this wonderful vital species.\""

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 18:21:14 GMT",
    "summary": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s annual Arctic report card shows how rapidly and profoundly climate change is warming and altering the region.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic last season was the hottest it has been in the past 125 years. The extent of sea ice during its usual maximum in March was the lowest in 47 years of satellite recordkeeping. The North American tundra was more green with plant life than ever recorded.",
      "These observations, shared Tuesday in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s annual Arctic report card, show how rapidly and profoundly the region is shifting as the planet warms.",
      "\u201cThe Arctic continues to warm faster than the global average with the 10 years that comprise the last decade marking the 10 warmest years on record,\u201d said Steve Thur, NOAA\u2019s acting chief scientist and its assistant administrator for oceanic and atmospheric research.",
      "As a result of this warming, \u201cmelting permafrost is altering ecosystems, turning over 200 watersheds in Arctic Alaska orange as iron and other elements are released into its rivers,\u201d Thur said. Researchers have observed higher acidity and a greater concentration of toxic metals in these rusting streams.",
      "That is one of many consequences of climate change in the region that the report outlines. This is the 20th year that NOAA has released its Arctic report card, but the first during President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "The Trump administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay other reports about climate change, including the National Climate Assessment and a database of billion-dollar climate disasters. Trump has also called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and his administration is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes it.",
      "In a news conference Tuesday, Matthew Druckenmiller, one of the report's authors and a research scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, said the team \u201cdid not receive any political interference with our results.\u201d",
      "Outside scientists interviewed by NBC News said the report struck largely the same tone and message of concern as in past years, with a few minor exceptions.",
      "\u201cI honestly did not see much of a tone shift in comparison to previous Arctic report cards in years past, which was great to see,\u201d said Tom Di Liberto, a climate scientist and the media director at Climate Central. \u201cThe implications of their findings are the same as past Arctic report cards. The Arctic is the canary in the coal mine.\u201d",
      "Di Liberto previously worked in NOAA\u2019s communications office but was laid off in March, when the agency cut workers who were new to their roles. He pointed out that last year\u2019s report called for a reduction of fossil fuel production in its headline, whereas the new one did not mention fossil fuels at all. Otherwise, he didn\u2019t notice a major change.",
      "NOAA unveiled the report, which describes how climate change is scrambling ecosystems and threatening livelihoods in the Arctic region, at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting in New Orleans. The event, one of the biggest science conferences of the year, is attended by thousands of scientists.",
      "Marc Alessi, a climate scientist and fellow at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the report card \u201cdoes a great job of reporting the facts of what is literally happening on the ground in the Arctic.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone reading this can see that it is still screaming red alarm,\u201d he added.",
      "The report\u2019s authors highlight \u2014 in somewhat dry language \u2014 how proposed budget cuts to the network of science programs that take measurements in the Arctic, such as satellite programs that measure sea ice, could endanger the data collection that drives the report and decisions made based on it.",
      "\u201cRisks to funding and staffing, alongside aging infrastructure, may compound existing AON [Arctic Observing Network] gaps, jeopardizing long-term trend analyses and undermining decision-making,\u201d the report says.",
      "It highlights in particular several satellites that are part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program and scheduled to be decommissioned in 2026. Their loss will limit measurements of sea ice, according to the report. It also notes that a dataset on tundra greenness won\u2019t be updated because of funding cuts at NASA and that other climate datasets could be affected by federal budget cuts proposed for the 2026 fiscal year.",
      "The Arctic is warming two to four times faster than other parts of the Earth because of a dynamic called Arctic amplification, which changes both ocean currents and how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth\u2019s surface near the pole.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s this feedback where you lose sea ice, land ice, you start to absorb more sunlight and you start to warm much more rapidly,\u201d Alessi said.",
      "Temperature records are organized by Arctic water year, so the most recent one ran from October 2024 through September 2025."

      "Now they\u2019re looking into tightening Australia\u2019s gun laws to make it harder for residents to get their hands on the kind of high-powered rifles and shotguns that were reportedly used Sunday to stain the sands of Bondi Beach with blood.",

      "Sunday\u2019s shooting was the deadliest mass shooting in Australia since April 1996, when a gunman armed with two semi-automatic weapons went on a rampage in the tourist town of Port Arthur, on the island of Tasmania, that left 35 dead and 23 wounded.",
      "That bloodletting resulted in legislation that banned ownership of most automatic and semiautomatic rifles and drastically reduced the number of mass killings in Australia.",

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong activist and media mogul who was a major figure in 2019 pro-democracy protests, was convicted on all charges Monday in a landmark national security trial that has drawn international scrutiny and become a symbol of Beijing\u2019s crackdown on dissent in the Chinese territory.",
      "Lai, one of the most prominent critics of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party, was arrested in 2020 shortly after Beijing imposed a sweeping national security law in response to the anti-government protests, which roiled Hong Kong for months in 2019 and sometimes turned violent.",
      "He was found guilty of two charges of colluding with foreign forces under the national security law, as well as a charge of conspiracy to publish seditious materials under legislation from Hong Kong\u2019s time as a British colony.",
      "Lai, who turned 78 last week and faces life in prison, will be sentenced later and is allowed to appeal. On Monday, he appeared thin but in good spirits as he entered the courtroom wearing glasses, a pale green sweater and a gray jacket, smiling and waving to his family.",
      "Western governments and rights groups have criticized the 156-day trial, which began in December 2023, as politically motivated. Both the United States and Britain have called for Lai, a British citizen, to be released, and President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to \u201cfree\u201d him.",
      "In their 855-page verdict, the three handpicked judges focused on Lai's interactions with senior U.S. government officials, including meetings he had at the height of the 2019 protests with Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, national security adviser John Bolton and multiple members of Congress.",
      "Judge Esther Toh said Lai had persistently lobbied Washington to \u201chelp bring down\u201d the Chinese government by imposing sanctions, blockades or other hostile measures \u201cwith the excuse of helping the people of Hong Kong.\u201d",
      "She said it was \u201canalogous to the situation where an American national asked for help from Russia to bring down the U.S. government under the guise of helping the state of California.\u201d",
      "The judges also said Lai had used Apple Daily, the now-defunct pro-democracy tabloid he founded in 1995, to publish a series of seditious articles aimed at inciting hatred of the Hong Kong and Chinese governments and \u201cstirring up opposition against them.\u201d",
      "Lai, who pleaded not guilty and spent 52 days testifying, denied using his overseas connections to influence foreign policy on China and Hong Kong. He also said he never intended to \u201cpollute\u201d his readers\u2019 minds but was only commenting on facts.",
      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts. She said he continued to pursue his goals even after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020, but \u201cin a less explicit way.\u201d",
      "Lai\u2019s \u201conly intent\u201d was to \u201cseek the downfall\u201d of the Chinese Communist Party, Toh said, \u201ceven though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people\u201d of China and Hong Kong.",
      "John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, welcomed the conviction, saying it \u201cdemonstrates the justice of the law and upholds Hong Kong\u2019s core values.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai has long used his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",
      "Lai\u2019s son Sebastien Lai said after the verdict that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his father\u2019s health condition and that \u201cthe U.K. government has to do more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to put action behind words and make my father\u2019s release a precondition to closer relationships with China,\u201d he told reporters in London.",
      "'We can bear witness'",
      "Lai\u2019s trial is seen as a test of judicial independence and press freedom in Hong Kong, which was promised its Western-style civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Members of the public lined up overnight to secure tickets to Monday morning\u2019s hearing, with police monitoring the area.",
      "A Hong Kong resident surnamed Chan, who declined to be identified by her full name for fear of retribution, said Lai was the \u201cmost recognizable\u201d face involved in the city\u2019s social movements.",
      "Chan, 27, said outside the court building that she felt a sense of \u201cabsurdity and anger\u201d about the verdict.",
      "\u201cAn individual can\u2019t change much, but we can bear witness,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the least we can do in a limited space.\u201d",
      "Rights groups criticized the conviction, with Human Rights Watch saying it was \u201cboth cruel and a travesty of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticize the Communist Party,\u201d Asia director Elaine Pearson said in a statement.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said the ruling \u201cunderscores Hong Kong\u2019s utter contempt for press freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai\u2019s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy,\u201d Beh Lih Yi, the group\u2019s Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement. \u201cThe risk of him dying from ill health in prison increases as each day passes \u2014 he must be reunited with his family immediately.\u201d",
      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the public slanders and smears against Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary by certain countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is entirely reasonable, fair and lawful\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s judicial organs \u201cto perform their duties, uphold the authority of the law and safeguard national security,\u201d said the spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.",
      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",
      "The Hong Kong government says Lai has received \u201cadequate and comprehensive\u201d medical services in custody and that it separates people such as Lai from other prisoners at their own request to ensure their \u201cpersonal safety and well-being.\u201d",
      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."

    "story": [
      "SANTIAGO, Chile \u2014 As Chileans vote on Sunday, even detractors of ultra-conservative former lawmaker Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast say the candidate whose radical ideas lost him the past two elections is likely to become the country\u2019s next leader.",
      "Kast\u2019s commanding lead in the polls over his rival in the presidential runoff, communist Jeannette Jara, shows how the hard-liner agitating for mass deportations of immigrants has seized the mantle of the traditional right in a country that once defined its post-dictatorship democratic revival with a vow to contain such political forces.",
      "Many voters are frustrated with the options",
      "But much is also up for grabs about Chile\u2019s political direction.",
      "Kast\u2019s claim to a popular mandate depends on his margin of victory on Sunday over Jara, the center-left governing party candidate who narrowly beat him in the first round of elections last month.",
      "Although various right-wing parties won around 70% of the vote in that election and later endorsed Kast, substantial support for Franco Parisi \u2014 a populist center-right candidate who described himself as an alternative to Kast\u2019s \u201cfascism\u201d \u2014 revealed that, between the contrasting ideologies of the front-runners, sit hundreds of thousands of centrist voters with no real representation.",
      "\u201cBoth are too extreme for me,\u201d said Juan Carlos Pileo, 44, who plans to cast a blank ballot Sunday, as voting is now mandatory in Chile\u2019s elections. \u201cI can\u2019t trust someone who says she\u2019s a communist to be moderate. And I can\u2019t trust someone who exaggerates the amount of crime we have in this country and blames immigrants to be fair and respectful.\u201d",
      "Kast raises expectations, but reality is a different story",
      "Even if elected, it remains uncertain whether Kast, an admirer of U.S. President Donald Trump, can implement his more grandiose promises. They include slashing $6 billion in public spending over just 18 months without eliminating social benefits, deporting over 300,000 immigrants in Chile with no legal status and expanding the powers of the army to fight organized crime in a country still haunted by Gen. Augusto Pinochet\u2019s military dictatorship from 1973 to 1990.",
      "For one, Kast\u2019s far-right Republican Party lacks a majority in Congress, meaning that he\u2019ll need to negotiate with moderate right-wing forces that could bristle at those proposals, significantly shaping policy and his own legacy.",
      "Political compromises could temper Kast\u2019s radicalism, but also jeopardize his position with voters who expect him to deliver quickly on his law-and-order campaign promises.",
      "At each campaign event, Kast has taken to ticking off the number of days remaining until Chile\u2019s March 11 presidential inauguration, warning immigrants without legal status that they should get out before they \u201chave to leave with just the clothes on their backs.\u201d",
      "Jorge Rubio, 63, a Chilean banker in Santiago, the capital, said he and like-minded Chileans are \u201calso counting down the days, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re voting for Kast.\u201d",
      "Boric\u2019s left-wing government is under fire",
      "As the pandemic shuttered borders, transnational criminal organizations like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua seized clandestine migration routes to gain a foothold in Chile, long considered among Latin America\u2019s safest and wealthiest countries. Homicides hit a record high in 2022, the first year of President Gabriel Boric\u2019s tenure.",
      "Kast insists that Boric\u2019s government is too soft on immigration and crime, which the far-right leader argues are connected although the data does not necessarily support his narrative. Boric\u2019s approval rating has hovered around just 30% for the past two years.",
      "\u201cWe are living through a moment of psychosis, thanks to this government,\u201d said Nati P\u00e9rez, an 87-year-old Peruvian who immigrated to Chile over a decade ago, heading to vote for Kast at an old railroad terminal in central Santiago that was converted into a vast polling center for the day. \u201cHe\u2019s not against immigrants, he\u2019s against crime. Venezuela sent all their criminals here.\u201d",
      "Others say the firebrand former student protester who came to power in 2021 pledging to transform Chile\u2019s market-led economy, has risen to the occasion. Boric went from criticizing the use of police force on the campaign trial to pouring money into the security forces. He sent the military to reinforce Chile\u2019s northern border, stiffened penalties for organized crime and created the country\u2019s first public security ministry.",
      "\u201cI actually thought this government would be worse. I have to admit that it has improved security,\u201d said Mariano Jara, 55, emerging from a polling station where he said he voted for Kast. \u201cThere\u2019s always more that can be done. There\u2019s room to get tougher.\u201d",
      "Chile\u2019s homicide rate has fallen in the last two years, now on par with the rate in the United States. But that has done nothing to change the widespread feeling of insecurity.",
      "In Chile, just 39% of people feel safe walking alone at night, according to a recent Gallup survey of 144 countries. That\u2019s around the same figure as in Ecuador, which is now in the midst of a violent, drug-driven crime wave. In Libya, where fractious militias jostle for political power, over 70% of people said they feel safe.",
      "Crime and migration overshadow all other concerns",
      "As Boric\u2019s former minister of labor, Jara became popular as the architect of the administration\u2019s most important welfare measures.",
      "That matters little now. Voters\u2019 concerns have forced her to switch gears. She has vowed to toughen border security, register undocumented migrants, tackle money laundering and step up police raids.",
      "But promises to restore law and order are more persuasive coming from an insurgent outsider who has made security a key part of his agenda for years.",
      "\u201cKast has been smart and strategic in focusing on migration and security,\u201d said Luc\u00eda Dammert, a sociologist and Boric\u2019s first chief of staff. \u201cIt has been very difficult for the Jara campaign to move him away from those issues.\u201d",
      "Learning from his previous two failed presidential runs, Kast has avoided topics that fire up his critics \u2014 such as his German-born father\u2019s Nazi past, nostalgia for Pinochet\u2019s dictatorship and opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion.",
      "When asked about his deeply conservative values, Kast, a devout Catholic and father of nine, says only that they remain the same. His supporters, including voters who previously spurned him over his stance on social issues, now say they\u2019re willing to trade abstract human rights concerns for increased safety on the streets.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not very nice to hear that he\u2019s going to separate immigrant children from their parents, it\u2019s sad, that\u2019s going to be a problem for me,\u201d said Natacha Feliz, a 27-year-old immigrant from the Dominican Republic, referring to a recent interview in which Kast said immigrant parents without legal status who didn\u2019t self-deport would be obliged to hand their kids over to the state.",
      "\u201cBut this is happening everywhere, not just in Chile. Let\u2019s just hope that our security situation improves.\u201d"

      "Tripoli's Red Castle museum has reopened for the first time since the 2011 uprising that toppled Moammar Gadhafi, unveiling a trove of treasures that span millennia, from ancient mummies to relics of Libya's turbulent and fascinating history.",
      "Formerly known as As-Saraya Al-Hamra, the fortress that houses the museum has long been a central landmark in Libya\u2019s capital, Tripoli. It houses an extensive collection of artifacts tracing 5,000 years of history, from prehistoric times through to Libya\u2019s Roman, Greek and Islamic eras.",
      "Collections include Islamic art and architecture as well as objects from Italian colonial rule, World War II and Libya's independence, with galleries dedicated to the prehistoric period and ancient Libyan tribes, such as the Garamantes.",
      "\u201cThe reopening of the National Museum is not just a cultural moment but a live testimony that Libya is building its institutions,\u201d Abdulhamid al-Dbiebah, prime minister of the Government of National Unity, said at a ceremony on Friday awash with fireworks at the site.",
      "The museum closed in February 2011 during the NATO-backed uprising against Gadhafi, as anti-government protesters in the northeastern city of Benghazi began calling for the leader to step down and for the release of political prisoners. As protests intensified, demonstrators took control of Benghazi and unrest spread to Tripoli, with the Libyan government using lethal force against demonstrators.",
      "When rebels launched their first attack on the Libyan capital in August that year, a group of armed men were reported to have entered the national museum, incorrectly believing it to conceal the entrance of a secret government tunnel. The museum\u2019s artifacts were largely left intact, though a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle belonging to Gadhafi was among the regime-linked objects vandalized.",
      "Gadhafi was eventually toppled with the help of an international coalition that included the U.S.",
      "Renovations for the museum, built in the 1980s and opened by Gadhafi, began in March 2023 by the Tripoli-based GNU.",
      "The reopening of the national museum indicates a recovery in the country\u2019s cultural sector, despite unresolved political dynamics. The country remains divided between administrations in the west and east that have not had a unified budget in more than a decade.",
      "But with a planned election on the horizon in 2026, Hager Ali, a research fellow at the German Institute for Global and Area Studies, said the museum's opening carries a political message.",
      "The reopening is \"kind of like a proof of concept of the western government that they are stable, especially in the forerun of elections,\" she told NBC News on Saturday, referring to the GNU.",
      "\"There really isn\u2019t anything that isn\u2019t political right now in Libya,\" she added. \u201cThis is very much a kind of a symbol that everyone can get behind.\"",
      "Since renovations began, Libya has recovered 21 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country after Gadhafi\u2019s fall, notably from France, Switzerland and the United States, the chairman of the board of directors of the antiquities department, Mohamed Farj Shakshoki, told Reuters ahead of the opening.",
      "Libya houses five UNESCO World Heritage sites, which in 2016 were all declared \"endangered\" due to instability and conflict.",
      "The historic town of Ghadames in western Libya was among the sites under threat, but conservation work spearheaded by the Managing Libya's Cultural Heritage project led to the site being officially removed from UNESCO's List of World Heritage in Danger in July."

      "When Volodymyr Zelenskyy last asked Ukrainians to vote for him, he was a political newbie, a former comedian eager to change his country and talk with Russia to end a protracted conflict.",
      "Six years later, Zelenskyy \u2014 transformed by the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion \u2014 is facing sudden pressure from the United States to hold a new election, even as he navigates Washington\u2019s push for a peace deal that could threaten Ukraine\u2019s future.",
      "President Donald Trump, frustrated by a lack of progress in peace talks, criticized Zelenskyy this week for \u201cusing war not to hold an election.\u201d It\u2019s a narrative that Moscow has exploited to label Zelenskyy\u2019s government \u201cillegitimate\u201d and thus impossible to negotiate with.",
      "Yet an election would currently be illegal, since Ukrainian law prohibits holding elections while martial law is in effect.",
      "Nonetheless, Zelenskyy now appears to be playing ball. But huge questions hang over the idea, from security to logistics, given the fierce fighting on the front lines and the daily Russian aerial assaults on Ukraine\u2019s cities.",
      "\u201cI do not want Ukraine to have a weak position, so that someone could use the absence of elections as an argument against Ukraine,\u201d Zelenskyy said Thursday. Elections could happen in 60 to 90 days, he has said, provided that Ukraine\u2019s allies help provide security on the ground.",
      "Ukraine was scheduled to hold a presidential election in early 2024, but it was postponed because martial law was introduced after Russia\u2019s February 2022 attack.",
      "After Trump\u2019s comment, Zelenskyy said he had asked lawmakers to prepare proposals \u201cenabling changes to the legal framework\u201d that would make elections possible.",
      "Beyond martial law, there are two major challenges, Zelenskyy said: security and the army.",
      "First, how would Kyiv ensure that people who come out to vote won\u2019t be hit in a sudden missile or drone strike? The Kremlin\u2019s attacks regularly plunge Ukrainian cities into frigid darkness for hours, which could complicate voting and ballot counting.",
      "\u201cElections always involve crowds,\u201d said Kyiv-based political analyst Volodymyr Fesenko. \u201cWhat do you do about air raid alerts and safeguarding electoral paperwork? If a siren goes off, do you just grab a bunch of election protocols and run into a shelter? I am having a hard time imagining how that could work.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on how the U.S. might help.",
      "Kyiv would also have to figure out how hundreds of thousands of soldiers fighting on the front lines would vote.",
      "Some forces could perhaps be rotated out to vote in relatively safer areas, but Ukraine is already low on manpower and could risk jeopardizing critical battlefield positions.",
      "To that end, Zelenskyy has called for a ceasefire during the election process. The Kremlin swiftly shot down the suggestion, having long rejected any ceasefire before a full peace deal is reached.",
      "Without a pause in fighting, more than 800,000 personnel in Ukraine\u2019s armed forces would be effectively shut out of any election process, said Yevheniia Kravchuk, a lawmaker with Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People party. It would be unsafe for people overseeing the voting, too, she said. \u201cI don\u2019t see any observers coming to the front line where you can be killed by a first-person view (FPV) drone like every 15 minutes,\u201d Kravchuk said in an audio message sent to NBC News on WhatsApp.",
      "Kravchuk pointed to the country\u2019s five different presidents since Vladimir Putin came to power in Russia in 2000. \u201cUkrainians understand that during the war, the first goal is to survive and to keep the country, keep the sovereign state,\u201d she said.",
      "Zelenskyy has been under domestic pressure, too, thanks to a corruption scandal. But even his opponents seemed skeptical of a wartime vote.",
      "It would take at least half a year after the end of martial law to organize elections that would be truly free and fair, said opposition lawmaker Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze. \u201cBut discussing all of this right now has little to do with the reality on the ground,\u201d Klympush-Tsintsadze, who represents the European Solidarity Party, said in an audio message on WhatsApp. \u201cWe are very far from the real end of this war,\u201d she added.",
      "Another complicating factor is that millions of Ukrainians fled the country when the war broke out and now live overseas. Millions more have been internally displaced by the fighting or now live in areas occupied by Russia (about 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory), so simply working out who is eligible to vote and how to reach them would pose an immense challenge, said Fesenko.",
      "Trump and Putin may think that the lack of an election undermines Zelenskyy\u2019s legitimacy, but Ukrainians don\u2019t seem to agree.",
      "An opinion poll conducted by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology in September found  that 63% of Ukrainians believe elections should be held only after a final peace agreement and a complete end to the war. Only 11% support holding elections right now, even without a ceasefire, according to the poll.",
      "Should an election be held in the near future, there is only one candidate who could challenge Zelenskyy, Fesenko said \u2014 Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the former commander in chief.",
      "Zaluzhnyi has remained a popular figure after leading the Ukrainian army through much of the war. He was sacked by Zelenskyy in early 2024 and is now serving as Ukraine\u2019s ambassador to Britain. Although Zelenskyy\u2019s position has been weakened by the corruption scandal, the president would still be a front-runner alongside Zaluzhnyi, Fesenko said. \u201cIt\u2019s just these two,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone else has much lower ratings.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the fourth year of the war, everyone is deeply exhausted,\u201d marketing specialist Ivan Datsko told NBC News on the phone from Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "Datsko, 33, said he felt that elections could be held but that there must at least be a ceasefire. \u201cNo rockets, no [drones] \u2014 and conditions that allow our soldiers to rotate safely. And of course, all Ukrainians who have left the country must also have the opportunity to vote,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf all these conditions are met, it could become a strong step toward real peace talks,\u201d Datsko added. \u201cFirst, silence on the front line, then elections, and after that, an agreement that truly protects Ukraine from future aggression and gives us a chance for peace and a normal life,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia has accused Zelenskyy of trying to cling to power. Last month, Putin said signing a peace deal with Zelenskyy would be \u201cpointless\u201d because he has lost his legitimacy after being too \u201cafraid\u201d to run again. The Kremlin said Friday that Zelenskyy\u2019s declared readiness for an election may simply be his latest attempt to freeze the conflict before negotiating a deeper peace deal \u2014 something Moscow has frequently rejected.",
      "Other countries have held elections in wartime and elected officials\u2019 democratic mandate becomes weaker the longer they are postponed, but elections also need to be practically possible, said Janina Dill, an international law expert on the use of force and a professor of global security at the University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cAnd calls for an election must not be used to weaken Ukrainian agency and resolve in the midst of an existential struggle for national survival,\u201d Dill added."
