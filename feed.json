      "Dutch wunderkind and celebrity-favorite Iris Van Herpen has occupied fashion\u2019s edge for years",
      "PARIS -- For years, Dutch wunderkind and celebrity-favorite Iris Van Herpen has occupied fashion\u2019s edge, conjuring couture from unexpected sources \u2014 banana leaves, cocoa beans and even 3D-printed polymers \u2014 while exploring the intersection of biology, art and design.",
      "Monday\u2019s collection at Paris Couture Week, \u201cSympoiesis,\u201d felt like the culmination of her restless experimentation: A show that dared to imagine clothing as both organism and artifact.",
      "In a shadowy Paris venue, Van Herpen sent out a series of gossamer gowns spun from alternative fibers so fine and insubstantial that they seemed conjured from air itself.",
      "At the collection\u2019s heart, a luminous \u201cliving dress,\u201d animated by millions of bioluminescent algae, quietly stole the scene.",
      "The algae, thriving within a custom-molded nutrient matrix, glimmered in electric blue as if stitched from the deep sea \u2014 offering an eerie, captivating spectacle that went beyond mere artifice.",
      "Elsewhere, Van Herpen introduced wedding gowns crafted from lab-grown bio-protein, a futuristic Japanese fiber that\u2019s biodegradable and endlessly recyclable \u2014 a glimpse of a fashion industry reimagined for a new era.",
      "If the show dazzled, it also underscored a rare feat in modern couture: Independence.",
      "In a world where most designers rely on billion-dollar groups to bankroll their dreams, Van Herpen stands nearly alone, thriving outside the grip of giants like LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Kering.",
      "Her creations have become magnets for pop royalty and rule-breakers: Lady Gaga, Beyonc\u00e9, Bj\u00f6rk, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman have all worn her sculptural gowns on the world\u2019s biggest stages.",
      "At the Met Gala, Hailee Steinfeld stunned in a Van Herpen dress made from ocean plastic. Dove Cameron shimmered in her work in 2022.",
      "Star power helps sustain the atelier, but it\u2019s invention that defines her legacy. While many independents have vanished from the couture calendar, Van Herpen survives by never playing it safe.",
      "Every season, she proves that true originality is not only possible \u2014 but essential \u2014 in Paris.",
      "By harnessing living organisms and boundary-pushing textiles, Van Herpen\u2019s latest collection doubled down on her signature ethos: couture not just as spectacle or skill, but as an open question \u2014 what might fashion, and nature, become next?",
      "In a world obsessed with spectacle, Van Herpen continues to ask not only what we wear, but how we care for the world that makes it possible.",

      "Paris Couture Week begins with a striking moment as Cardi B appears in a custom Schiaparelli gown, holding a live crow",
      "PARIS -- Paris couture week opened not with sequins or red carpet pageantry, but Cardi B 's crow moment.",
      "Wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, the U.S. rapper stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.",
      "Her avian plus one squawked, glared, and nearly lunged \u2014 setting the tone for a show that soared straight into the surreal.",
      "It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. Elsa Schiaparelli, the house\u2019s founder, built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected \u2014 lobster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals \u2014 into the heart of high fashion.",
      "That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry\u2019s Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion.",
      "Inside, the mood was cinematic \u2014 gowns and jackets defined by intensity and ease, with the waist and hips shaped through unexpected techniques. Hints of disco sheen flickered like film across the runway.",
      "But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli\u2019s own restless spirit.",
      "Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York \u2014 a period \u201cwhen life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.\u201d",
      "Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures.",
      "Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential \u2014 an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends.",
      "\u201cChanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,\u201d Roseberry added.",
      "It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion.",
      "The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli\u2019s past collided with fashion\u2019s future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty.",
      "A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world\u2019s red carpets, a rare feat in today\u2019s luxury market. But above all, the brand\u2019s power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B\u2019s crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion\u2019s most potent magic is still the unexpected.",

      "Dinosaur fatigue may be a theme in \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d but moviegoing audiences don\u2019t seem to have that reservation. The newest installment in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise ruled the Fourth of July holiday box office with a global, five-day launch of $318.3 million, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "The Universal Pictures release, directed by Gareth Edwards, opened on Wednesday and earned $147.3 million in its first five days in 4,308 North American theaters. An estimated $91.5 million of that comes from the traditional \u201cthree day\u201d weekend, which includes the Friday holiday, Saturday and projected Sunday ticket sales.",
      "Internationally, it opened in 82 markets including China, adding $171 million to the opening total. According to the studio, $41.5 million of that came from China alone, where it played on 65,000 screens, 760 of which were IMAX. It's the country's biggest MPA (Motion Picture Association) opening of the year.",
      "\u201cRebirth,\u201d starring Scarlett Johansson, Mahershala Ali and Jonathan Bailey, is the fourth movie in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d series and the seventh since Steven Spielberg\u2019s original Michael Crichton adaptation stormed theaters in the summer of 1993. The new film received mixed reviews from critics, carrying a 51% on Rotten Tomatoes, and B CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences.",
      "Factors like the holiday weekend, inflation and post-COVID moviegoing realities make it difficult to fairly compare the \u201cRebirth\u201d launch to the other films in the \u201cJurassic World\u201d franchise, the first of which opened to $208 million domestically in 2015. The other two, \u201cFallen Kingdom\u201d and \u201cDominion\u201d opened to $148 million and $145 million respectively.",
      "\u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d introduced a new main cast to the series and brought back a familiar voice in \u201cJurassic Park\u201d screenwriter David Koepp to guide the story about a dangerous hunt for dinosaur DNA (not for making dinosaurs this time, but for curing heart disease). It cost a reported $180 million net to produce, not including marketing and promotion costs.",
      "The campaign was far reaching, including a global press tour, with stops everywhere from London to Seoul, integrated marketing across NBC Universal platforms and brand tie-ins with everything from Jeep and 7-11 to Johansson\u2019s skincare line.",
      "No major new films dared go up against the dinosaurs, who left last week\u2019s champion, the Brad Pitt racing movie \u201cF1,\u201d in the dust. \u201cF1\u201d fell a modest 54% in its second weekend with $26.1 million, helping bring its domestic total to $109.5 million. It continues to play on IMAX screens with accounted for $7.6 million of the North American weekend ticket sales. Globally, it's nearing $300 million with a running total of $293.6 million.",
      "Third place went to Universal's live-action \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon,\u201d which earned $11 million in its fourth weekend, bringing its domestic total to $224 million. Disney and Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d landed in fourth place with $5.7 million. Globally, \u201cElio\u201d has just crossed $96 million in three weekends.",

      "Osbourne formed Black Sabbath in 1968 in Birmingham, a city then known for its heavy industry that became the crucible of the British metal scene. Black Sabbath\u2019s devil imagery and thunderous sound made them one of the era's most influential \u2014 and parent-scaring \u2014 metal acts. Both the band and Osbourne as a solo artist have been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",

      "However, as the Trump administration pursues a nationwide crackdown targeted at visa holders it believes have engaged in antisemitic or pro-militant behavior, the standard for releasing once-privileged information seems to have been relaxed.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- While Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs awaits a jury\u2019s verdict in his federal sex trafficking trial, the once-celebrated music mogul has seen his business empire rapidly unravel.",
      "Combs, 55, who is one of the most influential figures in hip-hop history, now faces charges, including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking involving two former partners and transporting people across state lines for prostitution. Prosecutors have painted a dark portrait of the mogul, whose alleged pattern of violence included drug-fueled sex parties he reportedly called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "If convicted, the three-time Grammy winner could face life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how Combs\u2019 business portfolio and public image have crumbled under the weight of the allegations.",
      "Before Combs was arrested and charged, his major business ventures had collapsed: He stepped down and later fully divested from Revolt TV, which was founded in 2013. The network offered a mix of programming focused on hip-hop culture, R&B music, social justice and documentaries.",
      "He also reportedly lost a Hulu reality series deal and saw his once-iconic fashion brand Sean John vanish from Macy\u2019s shelves.",
      "After surveillance footage surfaced last year showing Combs physically assaulting singer Cassie, his then-girlfriend, in 2016, consequences mounted: New York City revoked his ceremonial key, Peloton pulled his music, Howard University rescinded his honorary degree and his charter school in Harlem cut ties.",
      "Last year, Combs settled a legal dispute with Diageo, relinquishing control of his lucrative spirits brands, Ciroc and DeLe\u00f3n. While many of his ventures have unraveled, his music catalog \u2014 for now \u2014 remains intact.",
      "Bad Boy Records may be synonymous with 1990s icons like The Notorious B.I.G., Faith Evans, Ma$e, and 112, but Combs kept the label relevant before his arrest with high-profile releases.",
      "In 2023, Combs dropped \u201c The Love Album: Off the Grid,\u201d which was his first solo studio album in nearly two decades, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e released her critically acclaimed project \u201d The Age of Pleasure \" through Bad Boy. Both albums earned Grammy nominations, with Mon\u00e1e\u2019s effort recognized in the prestigious record of the year category.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cThe Love Album\u201d release, Combs made headlines by returning Bad Boy publishing rights to several former artists and songwriters, years after he was criticized for how he handled their contracts.",
      "Bad Boy Records remains operational, but the label has been significantly shaken by Combs' legal firestorm and it hasn't announced any major upcoming releases.",
      "Last week, a surprise EP called \u201cNever Stop\u201d released by his son, King Combs, and Ye (formerly Kanye West), showed support for the embattled mogul. The project was released through Goodfellas Entertainment.",
      "Bad Boy Records remained active through 2022, backing Machine Gun Kelly\u2019s \u201cMainstream Sellout\u201d under the Bad Boy umbrella. He was a producer on MTV\u2019s reality television series \u201cMaking the Band,\u201d and \u201cMaking His Band,\u201d launching the careers of artists like the girl group Danity Kane and male R&B group Day 26.",
      "Combs has been sued by multiple people who claim to have been victims of physical or sexual abuse. He has already paid $20 million to settle with one accuser, his former girlfriend Cassie. Most of those lawsuits, though, are still pending. It isn\u2019t clear how many, if any, will be successful, or how much it will cost Combs to defend himself in court. Combs and his lawyers have denied all the misconduct allegations and dismissed his accusers as out for a big payday.",
      "Federal prosecutors have also informed the court that if Combs is convicted, they would seek to have him forfeit any assets, including property, \u201cused to commit or facilitate\u201d his crimes. They won\u2019t detail exactly what property that might involve until after the trial is over.",
      "Despite the legal turmoil surrounding Combs, his music catalog remains widely available on major streaming platforms including Spotify, Apple Music and Amazon Music. None of the streamers have publicly addressed whether they plan to adjust how his music is featured if Combs is convicted.",
      "Interestingly, Combs\u2019 music saw a roughly 20% boost in U.S. streaming between April and May 2025, his biggest monthly spike this year, according to Luminate. The numbers jump coincided with key moments in the trial, including testimonies from Cassie and Kid Cudi.",
      "However, there was a slight drop-off with a 5 to 10% decrease in June compared to the previous month\u2019s streams.",
      "Streaming makes up a fraction of an artist's revenue and is calculated through a complicated process called \u201cstreamshare.\" Most artists see very little pay from digital services.",
      "Sean John, founded in 1998, has gone largely dormant, with its presence disappearing from major retailers like Macy's. There are no clear signs of a relaunch on the horizon.",
      "In 2023, Combs launched Empower Global, an online marketplace designed to uplift Black-owned businesses and strengthen the Black dollar. He positioned the platform as a modern-day \u201cBlack Wall Street,\u201d backing it with a reported $20 million of his own investment.",
      "The platform debuted with 70 brands and planned to expand by onboarding new Black-owned businesses each month, aiming to feature more than 200 by year\u2019s end.",
      "However, as 2023 came to a close, several brands cut ties with Empower Global. It was reported that some cited disappointing performance and growing concerns over the misconduct allegations surrounding Combs.",

      "A top official at the Food and Drug Administration recently overruled government scientists on the availability of two COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- The government\u2019s top vaccine official working under Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently restricted the approval of two COVID-19 vaccines, disregarding recommendations from government scientists, according to federal documents released Wednesday.",
      "The new memos from the Food and Drug Administration show how the agency\u2019s vaccine chief, Dr. Vinay Prasad, personally intervened to place restrictions on COVID shots from vaccine makers Novavax and Moderna.",
      "Both vaccines were approved by the FDA in May after months of analysis by rank-and-file FDA reviewers.",
      "But internal correspondence show Prasad disagreed with staffers who planned to approve the shots for everyone 12 and older, similar to previous COVID vaccines. The scientists had concluded the benefit from the vaccines and the risk of COVID-19 outweighed the risk of possible side effects, which are rare.",
      "Instead Prasad decided the shots should be limited to those who face special risks from the virus\u2014 seniors or children and adults with underlying medical issues.",
      "Prasad explained that the COVID vaccine benefits must be reconsidered in light of falling rates of death and hospitalization and the possibility for vaccine side effects. It\u2019s the latest in a series of vaccine restrictions imposed by officials working under Kennedy, who has long questioned the benefits of vaccines.",
      "\u201cEven rare vaccination related harms both known and unknown now have higher chance of outweighing potential benefits\u201d Prasad wrote in a five-page memo explaining his decision.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months.",
      "Top FDA leaders are typically not involved in the review of individual products. Officials like Prasad can overrule staffers, but such cases are rare and often controversial.",
      "News of the FDA documents was first reported by the New York Times.",
      "Prasad was hired to lead the FDA\u2019s vaccine center in May, after the previous director, Dr. Peter Marks, was forced to resign over disagreements with Kennedy. An academic researcher specializing in cancer therapies, Prasad came to prominence during the pandemic for criticizing public health measures, including the FDA\u2019s approval of COVID boosters for healthy adults and children.",
      "Since arriving at the agency he has worked with FDA Commissioner Mark Makary on new guidelines that will limit approvals of future COVID boosters to higher-risk Americans, mainly seniors and those with medical conditions like asthma and obesity.",
      "Those limits match the terms FDA recently approved for Novavax\u2019s shot, Nuvaxovid and Moderna\u2019s mNexspike. Novavax\u2019s vaccine is the only protein-based coronavirus vaccine available in the U.S. Moderna\u2019s vaccine is an updated, lower-dose version of its existing mRNA-based vaccine.",
      "The review team for the Novavax vaccine pointed to data from a study in 30,000 adults, concluding that \u201cthe risk-benefit assessment for this vaccine technology remains favorable.\u201d",
      "FDA staff reached a similar conclusion for the Moderna vaccine, deeming it similar in safety and effectiveness to the company\u2019s original shot.",
      "Last week, the FDA finalized new warning labeling about the risk of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation, on shots from Moderna and Pfizer, the other maker of an mRNA-based shot for COVID.",
      "In his \u201coverride memo,\u201d reversing FDA staff\u2019s decision on the Moderna shot, Prasad pointed to the ongoing risk of myocarditis and questions about its frequency. The agency ordered Moderna to conduct further studies of the risk as a condition for the approving its updated shot.",
      "A spokesman for the administration said Prasad \u201chas raised serious concerns\u201d about the issue.",
      "\u201cWe will not ignore these risks and will ensure that the gold standard of science is used for any decisions,\u201d said Andrew Nixon, in an emailed statement.",
      "Outside researchers have noted that cases of the heart condition tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",

      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",
      "Doctors say the situation forces them to get creative in treating patients, but there\u2019s hope that prices may fall more in the future.",
      "Wegovy and Zepbound are part of a wave of obesity medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that have soared in popularity.",

      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",

      "One of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.",
      "That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.",
      "Dr. Courtney Younglove\u2019s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer\u2019s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.",
      "\u201cThen some of them just cancel their appointment because they don\u2019t have coverage,\u201d the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.",

      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",
      "Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.",

According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, marine energy, a term researchers use to refer to power generated from tides, currents, waves or temperature changes, is the world\u2019s largest untapped renewable energy resource.",
      "The MeyGen tidal energy project off the coast of Scotland has four turbines producing 1.5 megawatts each, enough electricity collectively to power up to 7,000 homes annually. On Thursday, the Swedish company SKF announced that its bearings and seals on one of the turbines had passed the 6 1/2-year mark without needing unplanned or disruptive maintenance. It has been working closely with the industry for a decade on design and testing.",
      "Achieving six years in the water with constant operations is a \u201cvery significant milestone\u201d that bodes well for the future of tidal energy, said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of Ocean Energy Europe.",
      "Scotland and the United Kingdom are global leaders in tidal energy. The MeyGen site, operated by SAE Renewables, has been sending electricity to the grid for about eight years.",
      "There are very few tidal energy projects generating electricity continuously. Most have been tests and demonstrations, said Andrea Copping, an expert in marine renewable energy development. Copping said there are still large hurdles to overcome before tidal energy can be adopted more widely, such as dealing with regulatory issues, potential environmental effects and conflicts with other ocean users.",
      "Still, the Scotland project seems to have addressed the question of whether the turbines can last in seawater, added Copping, a distinguished faculty fellow in the School of Marine and Environmental Affairs at the University of Washington.",
      "\u201cI think they have checked the boxes,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause skeptics, and that includes investors of course and governments, said, \u2018How on Earth are you going to operate these things especially for any length of time in this very tough environment?\u2019 And that\u2019s what I think they proved.\u201d",
      "It's very hard to take what is essentially a wind turbine normally found on land and put it under water, said Fraser Johnson, operations and maintenance manager at MeyGen. The record-setting turbine should keep going for at least another year before it needs to come out of the water for maintenance, he added.",
      "The four turbines are in the Inner Sound of the Pentland Firth, a narrow channel between the Scottish mainland and Stroma Island known for strong tidal currents. Tidal energy systems need strong currents to make electricity efficiently. MeyGen plans to add 20 turbines in 2030 to produce more electricity, after needed upgrades to the electricity grid are finished. The site could eventually hold as many as 130 turbines that are more powerful than those at the site today.",
      "The MeyGen site is in the open water, while another type of tidal project involves creating a dam-like structure called a barrage across tidal waters. With four turbines, MeyGen is considered the largest tidal energy project of its kind worldwide, said Johnson.",
      "\u201cIt's a title we wish we didn't have. We want more, we want others,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately others are having difficulty achieving what MeyGen has achieved. But working with SKF moving forward, we'll push the industry forward.\u201d",

      "Last month, Barrack gave Lebanese officials a proposal that aims to disarm Hezbollah and move on with some economic reforms to try get Lebanon out of its nearly 6-year economic crisis, the worst in its modern history.

      "Fifteen police officers in the Philippines are in custody over their alleged role in the abductions and suspected killings of 34 cockfighting enthusiasts",
      "MANILA, Philippines -- Fifteen police officers have been taken into custody and are being investigated for their alleged role in the abductions and feared killings of at least 34 cockfighters, the Philippine police chief said Monday.",
      "The missing people were accused of cheating in the hugely popular sport, with their bodies reportedly dumped in a scenic lake with a restive volcano.",
      "The victims went missing around 2021 and 2022 mostly while on their way to or from cockfighting arenas dotting the main northern Philippine region of Luzon, including in the metropolitan Manila capital region.",
      "The unresolved disappearances again drew public attention after a key witness recently surfaced and accused his former employer, a gambling tycoon, of masterminding the killings, with bodies reportedly dumped in Taal Lake south of Manila or burned elsewhere.",
      "National police chief Gen. Nicolas Torre III said in a news conference that a key witness, who used the alias \u201cTotoy,\u201d provided crucial details. The cockfighting aficionados and workers were strangled and mutilated before being dumped.",
      "Police investigators have corroborated the details and evidence provided by the witness which will be used in criminal complaints to be filed by the Department of Justice against the suspects, he said.",
      "The witness has told local TV networks that he decided to speak out because his former employer was allegedly threatening to have him killed. He said he wanted to help ease the agony of families of the victims who had been demanding justice for their missing kin.",
      "\u201cI was very shocked,\u201d Torre said when asked how he felt over the disclosures made by the witness, who is under police guard. \u201cIt firmed up our resolve to really solve this because what happened was savage and not acceptable by any standard.\u201d",
      "Criminal complaints will be filed against the influential businessman, who owns cockfighting arenas and other gambling businesses, and other suspects, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. The businessman has denied the allegations.",
      "Remulla said he would ask Japan to help provide technology to help look for traces of the remains of the victims, which could still be retrieved from the bottom of Taal Lake about four years after the killings.",
      "While banned in the United States and other Western countries largely due to animal cruelty concerns, cockfighting has been a popular pastime and gambling sport in many parts of Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, Latin America and some parts of Europe.",
      "Cockfighting arenas are found prominently in far-flung rural towns and major cities across the Philippines and draw large numbers of aficionados in an industry that has become a vibrant part of the local culture and a regulated gambling business that generates state revenues and thousands of jobs. The game involves pitting two roosters \u2014 with razor-sharp gaffs or steel blades attached to their legs \u2014 in a battle often to the death amid the roar of the crowd.",
      "The missing cockfighting aficionados and workers were accused of cheating by discreetly taking steps to weaken one rooster or diminishing its chances of winning, including by slightly injuring it, then betting on the other rooster.",

    "story": [
      "Amnesty International says executions in Saudi Arabia hit a record high last year, with 345 people put to death",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Executions in Saudi Arabia surged last year to a record high, Amnesty International said Monday, as activists increasingly warn about the kingdom's use of the death penalty in nonviolent drug cases.",
      "Saudi Arabia executed 345 people last year, the highest number ever recorded by Amnesty in over three decades of reporting. In the first six months of this year alone, 180 people have been put to death, the group said, signaling that record likely will again be broken.",
      "This year, about two-thirds of those executed were convicted on non-lethal drug charges, the activist group Reprieve said separately. Amnesty also has raised similar concerns about executions in drug cases.",
      "Saudi Arabia has not offered any comment on why it increasingly employs the death penalty in the kingdom. Saudi officials did not respond to detailed questions from The Associated Press about the executions and why it is using the death penalty for nonviolent drug cases.",
      "However, it conflicts with comments from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's day-to-day ruler, who in 2022 highlighted he limited its use to just homicide cases.",
      "\u201cWell about the death penalty, we got rid of all of it, except for one category, and this one is written in the Quran, and we cannot do anything about it, even if we wished to do something, because it is clear teaching in the Quran,\u201d the prince told The Atlantic.",
      "Saudi Arabia is one of several countries in the Middle East, including Iran, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates, that can levy the death penalty on drug-related charges. But the kingdom remains one of the world's top executioners behind only China and Iran \u2014 and its use of executions in drug cases appears to be fueling that.",
      "Amnesty documented the cases of 25 foreign nationals who are currently on death row, or were recently executed, for drug-related offenses. In those cases, Amnesty said the inmates on death row were not familiar with the legal system nor their rights, and had limited to no legal representation. Foreign nationals faced additional challenges when trying to secure a fair trial, Amnesty said. More than half of those executed this year in the kingdom were foreign nationals, according to Reprieve.",
      "One such national, Egyptian Essam Ahmed, disappeared in 2021 while working on a fishing boat in Sinai. A month later, his family received word he had been detained in Saudi Arabia and sentenced to death for drug trafficking. Ahmed claims he was forced by the boat's owner to carry a package for him at gunpoint.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in terror, we\u2019re scared every morning,\u201d said a family member of Ahmed's, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity fearing his comments could impact the case. \u201cEvery morning until 9 a.m., we\u2019re afraid that they took one of them for execution without us knowing.\u201d",
      "The family member added: \u201cWe don\u2019t have feelings. We\u2019re dead. Death would be easier. \u2026 They didn\u2019t even give me a chance to defend him and I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d",
      "Human rights groups for years have been critical of Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record. There also have been rapid societal changes in Saudi Arabia under King Salman and the crown prince. While pushing for women to drive, the kingdom has overseen the arrest of women\u2019s rights activists. While calling for foreign investment, Saudi Arabia also has imprisoned businessmen, royals and others in a crackdown on corruption that soon resembled a shakedown of the kingdom\u2019s most powerful people.",
      "In 2021, as part of the crown prince\u2019s criminal justice overhaul, Saudi Arabia\u2019s Human Rights Commission announced a moratorium on drug-related executions. The moratorium, however, remained in place for just under three years, before it was scrapped without an explanation.",
      "The executions also come as the kingdom continues to undertake bold reforms to diversify its economy as part of its \u201cVision 2030\u201d initiative.",
      "Jeed Basyouni, who directs Britain-based legal nonprofit Reprieve\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, insisted Prince Mohammed could change Saudi Arabia's execution policy rapidly if he wanted.",
      "\u201cHe could do mass pardons. He could insist on rewriting laws so that they are in line with international law,\" Basyouni said. \u201cThe billions spent on so-called reforms, designed to promote a more tolerant and inclusive kingdom under the crown prince\u2019s rule, mask an authoritarian state where daily executions for drug crimes are now the norm.\"",

      "Thirty-two defendants are on trial over a deadly fire at a Turkish ski resort hotel that killed 78 people and injured 133",
      "ISTANBUL -- A total of 32 defendants went on trial on Monday over a deadly fire that tore through a popular ski resort hotel, killing 78 people and injuring 133 others.",
      "The Jan. 21 fire hit the 12-story Grand Kartal Hotel at the Kartalkaya ski resort in the province of Bolu during the winter school break. Dozens of children taking family vacations were among the victims.",
      "The tragedy, which saw guests and staff jump out of windows to escape smoke and flame-filled rooms or dangle sheets out of windows to lower themselves down, sent shockwaves across Turkey and sparked widespread calls for accountability over negligence and safety violations.",
      "Thirteen of the defendants face potential jail terms of 1,998 years each on charges of killing or wounding with possible intent, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency, citing a 98-page indictment from the Bolu Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The 19 others are charged with negligently causing death or injury, for which they could be jailed for 22\u00bd years.",
      "With 210 plaintiffs and 32 defendants involved in the high-profile case, the trial is taking place at a sports center in Bolu that has been temporarily converted into a 700-seat courtroom to accommodate the proceedings, Anadolu reported.",
      "On Monday, family members and friends of the victims staged a demonstration outside the sports center, holding up posters of their loved ones and demanding justice.",
      "\u201cThis is not neglect, it is murder,\u201d the Anadolu Agency quoted Zeynep Kotan, the mother of 17-year-old Omur Kotan, who lost her life in the fire, as saying.",
      "The fire started at 3.17 a.m. local time as a spark from an electric grill plate in the fourth-floor kitchen lit a nearby garbage bin before melting the hose of a liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, and igniting the gas.",
      "Staff first noticed the flames at 3.24 a.m. and called the emergency services but within two minutes the blaze had \u201cexceeded controllable limits,\u201d according to the indictment.",
      "The blaze took hold of the wooden ceiling, accelerated by the flow of air from a door left open by escaping kitchen staff.",
      "The indictment says that inadequate measures on the stairs and elevators and the lack of a smoke extraction system caused flammable and toxic fumes to swiftly spread to the upper floors, filling corridors with smoke.",
      "The lack of emergency alarms, faulty fire detection and warning systems and insufficient staff fire training meant the hotel\u2019s 238 guests were not alerted to the blaze in time.",
      "Escape routes through the stairways and emergency exits were not properly fitted and there was no sprinkler system, turning the hotel\u2019s stairwells and life shafts into \u201cchimneys\u201d for the smoke to quickly reach the upper floors.",
      "The indictment adds that the absence of emergency lighting, fire escape signs and alternative exits stopped the safe evacuation of guests.",
      "The 14-day trial will hear that legal responsibility lay with owner Halit Ergul and company board members, including his wife and daughters, and managers.",
      "Also facing the higher punishment are Bolu\u2019s deputy mayor and deputy fire chief. Those facing the lesser charges consist of hotel staff, inspection officials and maintenance workers.",
      "The hotel first opened in 1999 and has been operated by Ergul\u2019s company since 2007.",
      "In a statement to prosecutors made within days of the fire, Ergul said the hotel was checked for fire safety every two years by government-authorized inspectors before receiving a tourism certificate, allowing it to operate. The most recent certificate was due to expire in March.",
      "The hotel\u2019s last inspection by the Culture and Tourism Ministry was conducted five weeks before the fire, Ergul said.",

      "PAMPLONA, Spain -- Thousands of daredevils ran, skidded and tumbled out of the way of a stampeding group of bulls at the opening run of the San Ferm\u00edn festival Monday.",
      "It was the first of nine morning runs or \u201cencierros\u201d during the famous celebrations held in the northern Spanish city of Pamplona.",
      "The bulls pounded along the twisting cobblestone streets after being led by six steers. Up to 4,000 runners take part in each bull run, which takes place over 846 meters (2,775 feet) and can last two to four minutes.",
      "Most runners wear the traditional garb of white trousers and shirt with red sash and neckerchief. The expert Spanish runners try to sprint just in front of the bull's horns for a few death-defying seconds while egging the animal on with a rolled newspaper.",
      "Thousands of spectators watched from balconies and wooden barricades along the course. Millions more follow the visceral spectacle on live television.",
      "The festival kicked off Sunday with the traditional \u201cchupinazo\u201d firework blast after which revelers doused one another with red or sparkling wine.",
      "While gorings are not rare, many more people are bruised and injured in falls and pileups with each other. Medics rush in to treat the injured and take the seriously hurt to a hospital.",
      "On Monday, Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that a few revelers had been injured, but it wasn\u2019t clear if their injuries were from gorings.",
      "Unofficial records say at least 15 people have died in the bull runs over the past century. The deadliest day on record was July 13, 1980, when four runners were killed by two bulls. The last death was in 2009.",
      "The rest of each day is for eating, drinking, dancing and cultural entertainment, including bull fights where the animals that run in the morning are slain in the bull ring by professional matadors each afternoon.",
      "The festival isn't without its detractors. On Saturday, animal rights activists marched through Pamplona wearing horns and splotched with fake blood in protest against the San Fermin bull runs. Some held up signs saying \u201cbullfights are a sin.\u201d",
      "The festival was made internationally famous by Ernest Hemingway\u2019s classic 1926 novel \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d about American bohemians wasting away in Europe.",

    "story": [
      "Syria is working to rebuild its energy sector after years of civil war and crippling sanctions",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- Abdulrazak al-Jenan swept the dust off his solar panel on his apartment roof overlooking Damascus. Syria's largest city was mostly pitch-black, the few speckles of light coming from the other households able to afford solar panels, batteries, or private generators.",
      "Al-Jenan went thousands of dollars in debt to buy his solar panel in 2019. It was an expensive coping mechanism at the time, but without it, he couldn't charge his phone and run the refrigerator.",
      "Syria has not had more than four hours of state electricity per day for years, as a result of the nearly 14-year civil war that ended with the ouster of former President Bashar Assad in December.",
      "Syria's new leaders are hoping renewable energy will now become more than a patchwork solution. Investment is beginning to return to the country with the lifting of U.S. sanctions, and major energy projects are planned, including an industrial-scale solar farm that would secure about a tenth of the country's energy needs.",
      "\u201cThe solution to the problem isn\u2019t putting solar panels on roofs,\u201d Syria\u2019s interim Energy Minister Mohammad al-Bashir told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s securing enough power for the families through our networks in Syria. This is what we\u2019re trying to do.\u201d",
      "Some of the efforts focus on simply repairing infrastructure destroyed in the war. The World Bank recently announced a $146 million grant to help Syria repair damaged transmission lines and transformer substations. Al-Bashir said Syria's infrastructure that has been repaired can provide 5,000 megawatts, about half the country's needs, but fuel and gas shortages have hampered generation. With the sanctions lifted, that supply could come in soon.",
      "More significantly, Syria recently signed a $7 billion energy deal with a consortium of Qatari, Turkish, and American companies. The program over the next three and a half years would develop four combined-cycle gas turbines with a total generating capacity estimated at approximately 4,000 megawatts and a 1,000-megawatt solar farm. This would \u201cbroadly secure the needs\u201d of Syrians, said Al-Bashir.",
      "While Syria is initially focusing on fixing its existing fossil fuel infrastructure to improve quality of life, help make businesses functional again, and entice investors, the U.N. Development Program said in May that a renewable energy plan will be developed in the next year for the country.",
      "The plan will look at Syria\u2019s projected energy demand and determine how much of it can come from renewable sources.",
      "\u201cGiven the critical role of energy in Syria\u2019s recovery, we have to rapidly address energy poverty and progressively accelerate the access to renewable energy,\u201d Sudipto Mukerjee, UNDP\u2019s resident representative in Syria, said in a statement announcing the plan.",
      "While the war caused significant damage to Syria's infrastructure, crippling Washington-led sanctions imposed during the Assad dynasty's decades of draconian rule made it impossible for Syria to secure fuel and spare parts to generate power.",
      "\u201cMany companies over the past period would tell us the sanctions impact matters like imports, implementing projects, transferring funds and so on,\u201d al-Bashir said.",
      "During a visit to Turkey in May, the minister said Syria could only secure about 1700 megawatts, a little less than 20%, of its energy needs.",
      "A series of executive orders by U.S. President Donald Trump lifted many sanctions on Syria, aiming to end the country\u2019s isolation from the global banking system so that it can become viable again and rebuild itself.",
      "The United Nations estimates the civil war caused hundreds of billions of dollars in damages and economic losses across the country. Some 90% of Syrians live in poverty. Buying solar panels, private generators or other means of producing their own energy has been out of reach for most of the population.",
      "\u201cAny kind of economic recovery needs a functional energy sector,\u201d said Joseph Daher, Syrian-Swiss economist and researcher, who said that stop-gap measures like solar panels and private generators were luxuries only available to a few who could afford it. \u201cThere is also a need to diminish the cost of electricity in Syria, which is one of the most expensive in the region.\u201d",
      "Prices for electricity in recent years surged as the country under its former rulers struggled with currency inflation and rolling back on subsidies. The new officials who inherited the situation say that lifting sanctions will help them rectify the country's financial and economic woes, and provide sufficient and affordable electricity as soon as they can.",
      "\u201cThe executive order lifts most of the obstacles for political and economic investment with Syria,\" said Qutaiba Idlibi, who leads the Americas section of the Foreign Ministry.",
      "Syria has been under Washington-led sanctions for decades, but designations intensified during the war that started in 2011. Even with some waivers for humanitarian programs, it was difficult to bring in resources and materials to fix Syria\u2019s critical infrastructure \u2014 especially electricity \u2014 further compounding the woes of the vast majority of Syrians, who live in poverty.",
      "The removal of sanctions signals to U.S. businesses that Trump is serious in his support for Syria's recovery, Idlibi said.",
      "\u201cRight now, we have a partnership with the United States as any normal country would do,\" he said.",
      "Meanwhile, Al-Jenan is able to turn on both his fans on a hot summer day while he watches the afternoon news on TV, as the temperature rises to 35 degrees Celsius (95 F). He doesn\u2019t want to let go of his solar panel but hopes the lifting of sanctions will eventually bring sustainable state electricity across the country.",
      "\u201cWe can at least know what\u2019s going on in the country and watch on TV,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really were cut off from the entire world.\u201d",

      "French police have intensified efforts to stop migrants crossing the English Channel",
      "ECAULT BEACH, France -- Across the English Channel, the U.K.'s white cliffs beckon. On fine days, men and women with children in their arms and determination in their eyes can see the shoreline of what they believe will be a promised land as they attempt the perilous crossing clandestinely, ditching belongings to squeeze aboard flimsy inflatable boats that set to sea from northern France.",
      "In a flash, on one recent crossing attempt, French police swooped in with knives, wading into the water and slashing the boat's thin rubber \u2014 literally deflating the migrants' hopes and dreams.",
      "Some of the men put up dispirited resistance, trying to position themselves \u2014 in vain \u2014 between the boat and the officers' blades. One splashed water at them, another hurled a shoe. Cries of \u201cNo! No!\" rang out. A woman wailed.",
      "But the team of three officers, one also holding a pepper-gas canister, lunged at the boat again and again, pitching some of those aboard into the surf as it quickly deflated. The Associated Press obtained video of the police boat-slashing, filmed on a beach near the French port of Boulogne.",
      "France's northern coast has long been fortified against invasion, with Nazi bunkers in World War II and pre-French Revolution forts. Now, France is defending beaches with increasing aggression against migrants trying at a record pace to go the other way \u2014 out to sea, to the U.K.",
      "Under pressure from U.K. authorities, France's government is preparing to give an even freer hand to police patrols that, just last week, were twice filmed slashing boats carrying men, women and children.",
      "The video obtained by AP was filmed Monday. Four days later, on \u00c9cault beach south of Boulogne, the BBC filmed police wading into the surf and puncturing another boat with box cutters, again pitching people into the water as it deflated.",
      "An AP journalist who arrived moments later counted multiple lacerations and saw dispirited people, some still wearing life jackets, clambering back up sand dunes toward woods inland. There, AP had spent the previous night with families and men waiting for a crossing, sleeping rough in a makeshift camp without running water or other basic facilities. Exhausted children cried as men sang songs and smoked around a campfire.",
      "The French Interior Ministry told AP that police haven't been issued orders to systematically slash boats. But the British government \u2014 which is partly funding France's policing efforts \u2014 welcomed what it called a \u201ctoughening\u201d of the French approach. The U.K. is also pushing France to go further and let officers intervene against boats in deeper waters, a change the government in Paris is considering. Campaigners for migrant rights and a police union warn that doing so could endanger both migrants and officers.",
      "Of the slashing filmed Friday by the BBC, the Interior Ministry said the boat was in distress, overloaded and riding low in the water, with migrants \"trying to climb aboard from the back, risking being caught by the propeller.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe gendarmes, in water up to their knees, intervened to rescue people in danger, pull the boat to shore and neutralize it,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "Around the campfire, the men stared into the flames and ruminated. Deniz, a Kurd with an infectious laugh and a deep singing voice, wanted more than anything to cross the channel in time to celebrate his 44th birthday in August with his 6-year-old daughter, Eden, who lives with her mother in the U.K. Like nearly all the migrating people that AP interviewed, surviving in camps that police frequently dismantle, Deniz didn't want to give his full name.",
      "Refused a short-stay U.K. visa, Deniz said he had no other option than the sea route, but four attempts ended with police wrecking the boats. He said that on one of those occasions, his group of around 40 people begged an officer patrolling alone to turn a blind eye and let them take to sea.",
      "\u201cHe said, \u2018No,\u2019 nobody going to stop him. We could stop him, but we didn\u2019t want, you know, to hurt him or we didn\u2019t want to argue with him,\u201d Deniz said. \u201cWe just let him, and he cut it with a knife.\u201d",
      "He believes that U.K. funding of French policing is turning officers into zealots.",
      "\u201cI say, 'Because of the money, you are not France soldiers, you\u2019re not France police. You are the English dogs now,\" he said.",
      "The coastal battle between police and migrants never lets up, no matter the hour or weather. Drones and aircraft watch the beaches and gendarmes patrol them aboard buggies and on foot. On \u00c9cault beach, a WWII Nazi gun emplacement serves as their lookout post.",
      "Inland waterways have been sealed off with razor wire and floating barriers to prevent launches of so-called \u201ctaxi boats.\" They motor to offshore pickup points, where waiting migrants then wade into the sea and climb aboard, children in their arms and on their shoulders.",
      "AP saw a 6 a.m. pickup Friday on Hardelot beach south of Boulogne. Many dozens of people squeezed aboard, straddling the sausage-like inflated sides \u2014 one foot in the sea, the other in the boat. It left about a half-dozen people on the beach, some in the water, apparently for lack of room. Gendarmes on the beach watched it motor slowly away.",
      "Campaigners who work with migrants fear that allowing police to intervene against boats farther offshore will panic those aboard, risking casualties. French officials are examining the possibility of police interventions up to 300 meters (980 feet) from the water's edge.",
      "\u201cAll that will happen is that people will take greater and greater risks,\u201d said Diane Leon, who coordinates aid efforts for the group M\u00e9decins du Monde along the coast. \u201cThe police entering the water \u2014 this was something that, until now, we saw only rarely. But for us, it raises fears of panic during boarding or of boats arriving farther and farther out, forcing people to swim to reach the taxi boats.\u201d",
      "In an AP interview, police union official R\u00e9gis Debut voiced concerns about potential legal ramifications for officers if people drown during police attempts to stop departures. He said officers weighed down by equipment could also drown.",
      "\u201cOur colleagues don't want to cross 300 meters to intercept the small boats. Because, in fact, we're not trained for that,\u201d said Debut, of the union UNSA Police.",
      "\u201cYou also need to have the proper equipment. You can\u2019t carry out an arrest wearing combat boots, a police uniform and the bullet-proof vest. So the whole process needs to be reconsidered.\u201d",
      "Around the campfire, men laughed off the risks of the crossings that French authorities say claimed nearly 80 lives last year. They had nothing left to lose and the channel was just one more hardship after tortuous journeys to France filled with difficulties and misery, they said.",
      "\u201cWe will never give up,\u201d Deniz said.",
      "According to U.K. government figures, more than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of this year, up by about 50% from the same period in 2024, and potentially on course toward a new annual record. About 37,000 people were detected crossing in 2024, the second-highest annual figure after 46,000 in 2022.",
      "Qassim, a 26-year-old Palestinian, messaged AP after crossing last week with his wife and their daughters, aged 6 and 4. The boat labored through waves for eight hours, he said.",
      "\u201cEveryone was praying,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe were patient and endured and saw death. The children were crying and screaming.\u201d",
      "\u201cNow we feel comfortable, safe, and stable. We are starting a new page,\" he wrote. \u201cWe will do our best to protect our children and ourselves and to make up for the difficult years we have been exposed to.\"",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia\u2019s rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials as high as 18 kilometers (11 miles) into the sky, depositing ash on villages and leading to flight cancellations.",
      "The volcano has been at the highest alert level since last month and no casualties were immediately reported.",
      "Indonesia\u2019s Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 5 kilometers (3 miles) down the volcano's slopes. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off volcanic earthquakes.",
      "The column of hot clouds that rose into the sky was the volcano's highest since the major eruption in November 2024  that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\u201cAn eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\u201d Wafid told The Associated Press from Switzerland where he was attending a seminar. \u201cWe shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\u201d",
      "The volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.",

      "Monday\u2019s activities were the result of the accumulation of hidden energy due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectible seismic activity while building up pressure that contributed to the huge explosive eruption, Wijaya said.",

      "Australian woman Erin Patterson has been found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives, who died after she deliberately served them poisonous mushrooms for lunch",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian woman Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "The jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn't yet been scheduled.",
      "Patterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.",
      "Three of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband, who survived the meal.",
      "It wasn\u2019t disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "The guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson\u2019s defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn\u2019t know were death caps. Prosecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.",
      "The case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children\u2019s only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to do so \u2014 she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.",
      "But prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces \u2014 the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.",
      "The simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson\u2019s motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.",
      "The individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests were one point of friction because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings, so she could lace the other diners\u2019 portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi \u2014 but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.",
      "Nearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn\u2019t become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators that she didn\u2019t own one.",
      "Patterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence \u2014 including that she\u2019d never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said that those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.",
      "She said she didn\u2019t become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied that she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.",
      "The bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media. During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.",
      "At least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.",
      "As it emerged half an hour before the verdict that the court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in the hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that family members of the victims were not among those present.",
      "Before the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson\u2019s home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson's as they left the courthouse Monday.",
      "\u201cI'm saddened, but it is what it is,\u201d said one friend, Ali Rose Prior, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Prior said, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "Prior, who attended every day of the trial, confirmed Patterson had told her: \u201cSee you soon.\u201d Prior said she would visit her friend in prison.",

      "Haiti\u2019s once illustrious Grand H\u00f4tel Oloffson has been burned down by gangs this past weekend",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- Haiti\u2019s once illustrious Grand H\u00f4tel Oloffson, a beloved Gothic gingerbread home that inspired books, hosted parties until dawn and attracted visitors from Mick Jagger to Haitian presidents, was burned down by gangs this past weekend.",
      "Hundreds of Haitians and foreigners mourned the news as it spread across social media, with the hotel manager on Monday confirming the fire on X in a brief comment. Even though gang violence had forced the hotel in Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince, to close in recent years, many had hoped it would reopen.",
      "\u201cIt birthed so much culture and expression,\u201d said Riva Pr\u00e9cil, a Haitian-American singer who grew up in the hotel from age 5 to 15.",
      "In a tearful phone interview, Pr\u00e9cil recalled how she learned to swim, dance and sing at the Oloffson.",
      "The attack on the community where the hotel was located began late Saturday, according to James Jean-Louis, who lives above the Oloffson. He told The Associated Press in a phone interview Sunday that he observed the flames as he and other residents were chased out while police and gangs exchanged heavy gunfire.",
      "Among those lamenting the fire was Michael Deibert, author of \u201cNotes From the Last Testament: The Struggle for Haiti,\u201d and \u201cHaiti Will Not Perish: A Recent History.\u201d",
      "He landed in Miami on Sunday only to open his phone and see a flurry of messages from friends in Haiti.",
      "\u201cWhen you went to the Oloffson, you really felt you were being connected with Haiti\u2019s political and cultural history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou went to Haiti and were never the same. And the Oloffson really captured that.\u201d",
      "The hotel attracted artists, intellectuals and politicians from Haiti and beyond, including Jacqueline Onassis and Tennessee Williams. It also survived coups, dictatorships and the devastating 2010 earthquake.",
      "Isabelle Morse, daughter of Richard Morse, who became the hotel's manager several decades ago, said he loved having writers, photographers and other artists at the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cHis sense of community was very important to him,\u201d she said in a phone interview Monday, describing the hotel as \u201chis whole life.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor him, it represented freedom, where people from all walks of life could come in and share that space,\" she said.",
      "Richard Morse did not return a message seeking comment. The renowned band he founded, RAM, posted on X early Monday that the hotel had \u201cburned to the ground.\u201d",
      "His daughter said her parents had hoped to reopen the Oloffson.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only a business, it\u2019s our home. We were raised there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was more about moving back home rather than reopening the business.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson served as a presidential summer palace in the early 1900s and then became a U.S. Marine Corps Hospital before a Swedish sea captain converted it into a hotel in the 1930s.",
      "It also served as inspiration for the fictional Hotel Trianon in Graham Greene\u2019s 1966 novel \u201cThe Comedians,\u201d set in Haiti under the brutal dictatorship of Francois Duvalier, best known as \u201cPapa Doc.\u201d",
      "In real life, tourism dwindled under the Duvaliers, and the hotel became a respite for aid workers and foreign correspondents.",
      "In the late 1980s, Richard Morse became the hotel\u2019s manager. His band, RAM, played Haitian roots music on Thursday nights that became legendary, as were the Day of the Dead celebrations known as F\u00e8t Gede that drew in Vodou practitioners.",
      "\u201cIt was a vessel for so many people to gather and freely express themselves,\u201d Pr\u00e9cil recalled. \u201cRAM really created that culture and that environment, made it a space that welcomed people from all types of denominations and sexual preferences.\u201d",
      "The Oloffson was nestled in the upscale community of Pacot in the southeast corner of the Port-au-Prince capital. It was surrounded by lush gardens and often described as a mythical place, renowned for its intricate latticework, turrets and spires and creaking parquet floors that characterize Haiti's endangered gingerbread homes.",
      "A 1940s advertisement by Haiti\u2019s tourism department said that the hotel was situated \u201cin the coolest section of the town\u201d and noted that English, French, German and Spanish were spoken there.",
      "The hotel closed in recent years as gangs began raiding and seizing control of once peaceful communities.",
      "\u201cA lot of Haiti\u2019s architectural heritage is going up in flames right now with so-called leaders stand by with their hands in their pockets,\u201d Deibert said. \u201dThe destruction of the Oloffson is symbolic of the destruction of Haiti\u2019s history and culture that we\u2019ve been watching over the last several years.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The former Librarian of Congress abruptly fired by President Donald Trump has found a new position with the country's largest philanthropic supporter of the arts.",
      "The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation exclusively told The Associated Press that Carla Hayden will join the humanities grantmaker Monday as a senior fellow whose duties will include advising on efforts to advance public knowledge through libraries and archives.",
      "The year-long post places Hayden back at the center of the very debates over American culture that surrounded her dismissal. The White House ousted Hayden, the first woman and the first African American to hold the title, after she was accused of promoting \u201cradical\u201d literary material by a conservative advocacy group seeking to squash Trump opposition within the federal government.",
      "Hayden acknowledged existing threats to \u201cthe free exchange of ideas\u201d in a statement to the AP.",
      "\u201cFor generations, libraries, archives, and cultural institutions have been the guardians of knowledge and the catalysts for human progress,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether, we will work to strengthen the public knowledge ecosystem and ensure that the transformative power of information remains accessible to all.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the Mellon Foundation has been working to fill fiscal holes for arts communities reeling from federal cuts. Its $15 million \u201cemergency\u201d fund aims to offset the $65 million that were supposed to go to the state humanities councils that organize book fairs, heritage festivals, theater productions and other programs fostering cultural engagement.",
      "The foundation has previously supported the American Library Association's efforts to counter book bans, increase scholarships for librarians of color and boost adult literacy.",
      "Mellon President Elizabeth Alexander said the foundation is thrilled to welcome Hayden, \u201ca leader with an unshakable regard for the public good of the American people,\u201d during such a \u201ccrucial time.\u201d Public knowledge institutions are navigating \u201chistoric challenges and transformative advances,\" according to Mellon, including artificial intelligence, digital technologies, federal funding withdrawals and censorship efforts.",
      "Hayden's tenure at the Library of Congress included modernizing its collection of the nation's books and history. Recent campaigns sought to improve accessibility for everyday visitors. She oversaw new initiatives reaching out to rural and online audiences. And it was Hayden who arranged for Lizzo's 2022 performance where the artist played a crystal flute owned by President James Madison \u2014 among the Library's troves of artifacts.",
      "Before her confirmation in 2016, Hayden spent more than two decades as CEO of Baltimore's Enoch Pratt Free Library system and was president of the American Library Association from 2003 to 2004. A graduate of Roosevelt University and the University of Chicago, she is a member of the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.",

      "Tesla sales plunged 13% in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, and industry analysts believe a large part of that slump is being driven by Musk's affiliation with Trump and far-right parties like Germany AfD.

      "The arrest of eight Vermont dairy farmers in April sent shock waves throughout New England's agriculture industry, and fears haven't eased since then",
      "MONTPELIER, Vt. -- After six 12-hour shifts milking cows, Jos\u00e9 Molina-Aguilar's lone day off was hardly relaxing.",
      "On April 21, he and seven co-workers were arrested on a Vermont dairy farm in what advocates say was one of the state\u2019s largest-ever immigration raids.",
      "\u201cI saw through the window of the house that immigration were already there, inside the farm, and that\u2019s when they detained us,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \u201cI was in the process of asylum, and even with that, they didn\u2019t respect the document that I was still holding in my hands.\u201d",
      "Four of the workers were swiftly deported to Mexico. Molina-Aguilar, released after a month in a Texas detention center with his asylum case still pending, is now working at a different farm and speaking out.",
      "\u201cWe must fight as a community so that we can all have, and keep fighting for, the rights that we have in this country,\u201d he said.",
      "Ryan Brissette, spokesman for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said agents initially responded to a report from a concerned citizen who saw two people carrying backpacks entering private farm property near the Canadian border. Agents apprehended one person at the scene and more during the ensuing search of the area, he said.",
      "The owner of the farm declined to comment. But Brett Stokes, a lawyer representing the detained workers, said the raid sent shock waves through the entire Northeast agriculture industry.",
      "\u201cThese strong-arm tactics that we\u2019re seeing and these increases in enforcement, whether legal or not, all play a role in stoking fear in the community,\u201d said Stokes, director of the Center for Justice Reform Clinic at Vermont Law and Graduate School.",
      "That fear remains given the mixed messages coming from the White House. President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the U.S. illegally, last month paused arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels. But less than a week later, Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said worksite enforcement would continue.",
      "Asked for updated comment Monday, the department repeated McLaughlin's earlier statement.",
      "\u201cWorksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\u201d she said.",
      "Such uncertainty is causing problems in big states like California, where farms produce more than three-quarters of the country\u2019s fruit and more than a third of its vegetables. But it\u2019s also affecting small states like Vermont, where dairy is as much a part of the state\u2019s identity as its famous maple syrup.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of all milk production in New England comes from Vermont, where more than half the state\u2019s farmland is dedicated to dairy and dairy crops. There are roughly 113,000 cows and 7,500 goats spread across 480 farms, according to the Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets, which pegs the industry\u2019s annual economic impact at $5.4 billion.",
      "That impact has more than doubled in the last decade, with widespread help from immigrant labor. More than 90% of the farms surveyed for the agency\u2019s recent report employed migrant workers.",
      "Among them is Wuendy Bernardo, who has lived on a Vermont dairy farm for more than a decade and has an active application to stop her deportation on humanitarian grounds: Bernardo is the primary caregiver for her five children and her two orphaned younger sisters, according to a 2023 letter signed by dozens of state lawmakers.",
      "Hundreds of Bernardo's supporters showed up for her most recent check-in with immigration officials.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult because every time I come here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be going back to my family or not,\u201d she said after being told to return in a month.",
      "Like Molina-Aguilar, Rossy Alfaro also worked 12-hour days with one day off per week on a Vermont farm. Now an advocate with Migrant Justice, she said the dairy industry would collapse without immigrant workers.",
      "\u201cIt would all go down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are many people working long hours, without complaining, without being able to say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to work.\u2019 They just do the job.\u201d",

      "It said the near-term outlook will likely hinge on several key factors like the extent to which trading partners are included in Trump letters, the rate of tariffs, and the effective date of such tariffs. A more distant implementation date might leave scope for some last-minute trade negotiations and maintain market optimism for potential resolutions or extensions, it added.",
      "\u201cWith the July 9 tariff deadline fast approaching, all eyes are trained on Washington, scanning for signs of escalation or retreat. The path forward isn\u2019t clear, but the terrain is littered with risk,\" Stephen Innes, managing partner at SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- After pouring brown, gritty liquid from a huge silver tank into a flute-like container known as a refractometer, South African beer brewing master Apiwe Nxusani-Mawela gives an expert nod of approval and passes it around to her students, who yell their observations with glee.",
      "\u201cWhen you are brewing you must constantly check your mixture,\u201d Nxusani-Mawela instructs them. \u201cWe are looking for a balance between the sugar and the grains.\u201d",
      "The 41-year-old Nxusani-Mawela is an international beer judge and taster, and is believed to be the first Black woman in South Africa to own a craft brewery, a breakthrough in a world largely dominated by men and big corporations. Her desire is to open South Africa's multibillion-dollar beer-brewing industry to more Black people and more women.",
      "At her microbrewery in Johannesburg, she's teaching 13 young Black graduates \u2014 most of them women \u2014 the art of beer making.",
      "The students at the Brewsters Academy have chemical engineering, biotechnology or analytical chemistry degrees and diplomas, but are eager to get themselves an extra qualification for a possible career in brewing.",
      "Wearing hairnets and armed with barley grains and water, the scientists spend the next six hours on the day's lesson, learning how to malt, mill, mash, lauter, boil, ferment and filter to make the perfect pale ale.",
      "\u201cMy favorite part is the mashing,\" said Lerato Banda, a 30-year-old chemical engineering student at the University of South Africa who has dreams of owning her own beer or beverage line. She's referring to the process of mixing crushed grains with hot water to release sugars, which will later ferment. \"It\u2019s where the beer and everything starts.\u201d",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's classes began in early June. Students will spend six months exploring beer varieties, both international and African, before another six months on work placement.",
      "Nxusani-Mawela's Tolokazi brewery is in the Johannesburg suburb of Wynberg, wedged between the poor Black township of Alexandra on one side and the glitzy financial district of Sandton \u2014 known as Africa's richest square mile \u2014 on the other.",
      "She hails from the rural town of Butterworth, some 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) away, and first came across the idea of a career in beer at a university open day in Johannesburg. She started brewing as an amateur in 2007. She has a microbiology degree and sees beer making as a good option for those with a science background.",
      "\u201cI sort of fell in love with the combination of the business side with the science, with the craftsmanship and the artistic element of brewing,\u201d she said.",
      "For the mother of two boys, beer brewing is also ripe for a shakeup.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make sure that being the first Black female to own a brewery in South Africa, that I\u2019m not the first and the last,\u201d she said. \u201cBrewsters Academy for me is about transforming the industry ... What I want to see is that in five, 10 years from now that it should be a norm to have Black people in the industry, it should be a norm to have females in the industry.\"",
      "South Africa's beer industry supports more than 200,000 jobs and contributes $5.2 billion to South Africa\u2019s gross domestic product, according to the most current Oxford Economics research in \u201cBeer\u2019s Global Economic Footprint.\u201d While South Africa's brewing sector remains male-dominated, like most places, efforts are underway to include more women.",
      "One young woman at the classes, 24-year-old Lehlohonolo Makhethe, noted women were historically responsible for brewing beer in some African cultures, and she sees learning the skill as reclaiming a traditional role.",
      "\"How it got male dominated, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Makhethe said. \u201cI\u2019d rather say we are going back to our roots as women to doing what we started.\u201d",
      "While Nxusani-Mawela teaches all kinds of styles, she also is on a mission to keep alive traditional African beer for the next generation. Her Wild African Soul beer, a collaboration with craft beer company Soul Barrel Brewing, was the 2025 African Beer Cup champion. It's a blend of African Umqombothi beer \u2014 a creamy brew incorporating maize and sorghum malt \u2014 with a fruity, fizzy Belgian Saison beer.",
      "\u201cUmqombothi is our African way, and everybody should know how to make it, but we don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that the beer styles that we make need to reflect having an element of our past being brought into the future.\u201d",
      "She's used all sorts of uniquely African flavors in her Tolokazi line, including the marula fruit and the rooibos bush that's native to South Africa and better-known for being used in a popular caffeine-free tea.",
      "\u201cWho could have thought of rooibos beer?\u201d said Lethabo Seipei Kekae after trying the beer for the first time at a beer festival. \u201cIt\u2019s so smooth. Even if you are not a beer drinker, you can drink it.\u201d",

      "A security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship.",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Crew members abroad a ship set ablaze by a series of attacks in the Red Sea abandoned the vessel Sunday night as it took on water, marking the first serious assault in the vital corridor for trade after a monthslong campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels there.",
      "Suspicion for the attack immediately fell on the Houthis, particularly as a security firm said it appeared bomb-carrying drone boats hit the ship after it was targeted by small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. The rebels' media reported on the attack but did not claim it. It can take them hours or even days before they acknowledge an assault.",
      "A renewed Houthi campaign against shipping could again draw in U.S. and Western forces to the area, particularly after President Donald Trump targeted the rebels in a major airstrike campaign.",
      "And it comes at a sensitive moment in the Middle East, as a possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war hangs in the balance and as Iran weighs whether to restart negotiations over its nuclear program following American airstrikes targeting its most-sensitive atomic sites amid an Israeli war against the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cIt likely serves as a message that the Houthis continue to possess the capability and willingness to strike at strategic maritime targets regardless of diplomatic developments,\u201d wrote Mohammad al-Basha, a Yemen analyst at the Basha Report risk advisory firm.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center first said that an armed security team on the unidentified vessel had returned fire against an initial attack and that the \u201csituation is ongoing.\u201d It described the attack as happening some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southwest of Hodeida, Yemen, which is held by the country's Houthi rebels.",
      "\u201cAuthorities are investigating,\u201d it said. It later said the ship was on fire after being \u201cstruck by unknown projectiles.\"",
      "Ambrey, a private maritime security firm, issued an alert saying that a merchant ship had been \u201cattacked by eight skiffs while transiting northbound in the Red Sea.\u201d",
      "Ambrey later said the ship also had been attacked by bomb-carrying drone boats, which could mark a major escalation. It said two drone boats struck the ship, while another two had been destroyed by the armed guards on board.",
      "The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said the ship was taking on water and its crew had abandoned the vessel.",
      "The U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet referred questions to the military's Central Command, which said it was aware of the incident without elaborating.",
      "Authorities did not identify the vessel for hours. However, the description of the vessel targeted matched against the Liberian-flagged bulk tanker Magic Seas, which had been broadcasting it had an armed security team on board in the vicinity the attack took place and had been heading north. EOS Risk Group, another maritime security firm, identified the targeted vessel as being a Liberian-flagged ship as well.",
      "The Magic Seas' owners did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Houthi rebels have been launching missile and drone attacks against commercial and military ships in the region in what the group\u2019s leadership has described as an effort to end Israel\u2019s offensive against Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The group's al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged the attack occurred, but offered no other comment on it as it aired a speech by its secretive leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi. However, Ambrey said the vessel targeted met \u201cthe established Houthi target profile,\" without elaborating.",
      "Between November 2023 and January 2025, the Houthis targeted more than 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two of them and killing four sailors. That has greatly reduced the flow of trade through the Red Sea corridor, which typically sees $1 trillion of goods move through it annually.",
      "The Houthis paused attacks in a self-imposed ceasefire until the U.S. launched a broad assault against the rebels in mid-March. That ended weeks later and the Houthis haven't attacked a vessel, though they have continued occasional missile attacks targeting Israel. On Sunday, the group claimed launching a missile at Israel which the Israeli military said it intercepted. Shipping through the Red Sea, while still lower than normal, has increased in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, a wider, decadelong war in Yemen between the Houthis and the country\u2019s exiled government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, remains in a stalemate. The Yemeni Coast Guard, which is loyal to the exiled government, has engaged in a firefight with at least one vessel in the Red Sea in the past as well.",
      "Pirates from Somalia also have operated in the region, though typically they've sought to capture vessels either to rob or ransom their crews. But neither the Yemeni Coast Guard nor the pirates have been known to use drone boats in their attacks.",

    "story": [
      "America\u2019s largest trade partner is awaiting word on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on its goods",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) \u2014 America\u2019s largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks.",
      "The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\u201d The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cOn the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \u201cThey cannot change the way they run the EU\u2019s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\u201d",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \u201csignificant increases\u201d in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\u201cIf we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cAnd if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said.",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for home shoppers facing rising home prices",
      "NEW YORK -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell for the fifth straight week to its lowest level since early April, an encouraging sign for potential buyers who have wrestled with rising home prices.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.67% from 6.77% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.95%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell to 5.80% from 5.89% last week. A year ago, it was 6.25%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "High borrowing costs are also putting pressure on the new home market. Last week, the government reported that sales of new U.S. homes fell nearly 14% in May from the previous month.",
      "Recent data suggests sales could pick up in the coming months, especially with the recent decline in mortgage rates. A seasonally adjusted index of pending U.S. home sales rose 1.8% in May from the previous month and increased 1.1% from May last year, the National Association of Realtors said last week.",
      "There\u2019s usually a month or two lag between a contract signing and when the sale is finalized, which makes pending home sales a bellwether for future completed home sales.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.33% at midday Thursday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "Mortgage rates have now fallen five weeks in a row, reflecting the recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "The recent decline in mortgage rates appears to have encouraged some home shoppers. Last week, mortgage applications rose 2.7% from a week earlier, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",

      "NEW YORK -- Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 of its vehicles across the U.S. and Canada due to potential manufacturing defects that could cause engine failure.",
      "The recall covers certain Nissan Rogues between 2021-2024 model years and 2019-2020 Altimas \u2014 as well as a number of 2019-2022 Infiniti QX50s and 2022 Infiniti QX55s sold under the automaker's luxury brand, according to Nissan and documents published by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration this week.",
      "The vehicles impacted carry specific \u201cVC-Turbo\u201d engines that may have manufacturing defects in their bearings, the NHTSA's recall report notes. This may cause engine damage and possibly lead to engine failure while driving, the regulator warns \u2014 increasing crash risks.",
      "Engine bearing failures \u201care not typically instantaneous and tend to progress over time,\u201d the NHTSA\u2019s recall report notes. That means effected drivers may see multiple warning signs to look out for \u2014 including abnormal noises or malfunction indicator lights.",
      "In the U.S., 443,899 vehicles are covered in this recall, per NHTSA documents. And in Canada, 37,837 are affected, a Nissan spokesperson confirmed to The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "As a remedy, the NHSTA's recall report notes, Nissan and Infiniti dealers will inspect the engine pan of these-now recalled cars \u2014 and repair or replace the engine if necessary. The recall covers vehicles with either 3-cylinder 1.5L or 4-cylinder 2.0L VC-Turbo engines. Potential repairs \u2014 which will be performed free of charge \u2014 will depend on the engine and whether or not debris is detected during the inspection.",
      "In an emailed statement, Nissan said it initiated this recall as part of its \u201congoing commitment to customer safety.\u201d And in late August, the company added, notification letters will be mailed out to affected owners \"with instructions to bring their vehicle to a Nissan dealer or INFINITI retailer for inspection and repair if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Nissan's recall lookup.",

      "Ukrainian authorities are enlisting European help to increase domestic military production as the United States pauses some weapons shipments to Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The decision by the United States to pause some weapons shipments to Ukraine has come at a tough time for Kyiv: Russia\u2019s bigger army is making a concerted push on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line and is intensifying long-range drone and missile attacks that increasingly hammer civilians in Ukrainian cities.",
      "Washington has been Ukraine\u2019s biggest military backer since Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its neighbor on Feb. 24, 2022. But the Trump administration has been disengaging from the war, and no end to the fighting is in sight, despite recent direct peace talks.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at Ukraine\u2019s options following the U.S. pause of some arms deliveries:",
      "Amid recurring concerns in Kyiv about how much military support its allies can supply and how quickly, Ukraine has raced to build up its domestic defense industry.",
      "The country's output has gradually grown, especially in the production of more and increasingly sophisticated drones, but Ukraine needs to speedily scale up production.",
      "Crucially, some high-tech U.S. weapons are irreplaceable. They include Patriot air defense missiles, which are needed to fend off Russia\u2019s frequent ballistic missile attacks, but which cost $4 million each. That vital system is included in the pause, and many cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, could become increasingly vulnerable.",
      "A senior Ukrainian official said Thursday that Patriot systems are \u201ccritically necessary\u201d for Ukraine, but U.S.-made HIMARS precision-guided missiles, also paused, are in less urgent need as other countries produce similar assets.",
      "\u201cOther countries that have these (Patriot) systems can only transfer them with U.S. approval. The real question now is how far the United States is willing to go in its reluctance to support Ukraine,\u201d he told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of sensitivity of the subject.",
      "The official said that Patriot missiles exist in sufficient numbers globally, and he said that accessing them requires political resolve.",
      "\u201cThere are enough missiles out there,\u201d he said, without providing evidence.",
      "He also stated that Ukraine has already scaled up its domestic production of 155 mm artillery shells, which were once critically short, and is now capable of producing more than is currently contracted. \u201cSupplies from abroad have also become more available than before,\u201d he said.",
      "Amid at times fraught relations with U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been enlisting greater European help for his country\u2019s arms manufacturing plans.",
      "European countries don\u2019t have the production levels, military stockpiles or the technology to pick up all the slack left by the U.S. pause, but Zelenskyy is recruiting their help for ambitious joint investment projects.",
      "Draft legislation to help Ukrainian defense manufacturers scale up and modernize production, including building new facilities at home and abroad, will be put to a vote in the Ukrainian parliament later this month, Defense Minister Rustem Umerov announced this week.",
      "Zelenskyy said last month that major investments will go to the production of drones and artillery shells.",
      "\u201cThe volume of support this year is the largest since the start of the full-scale war,\u201d he said about commitments from foreign countries.",
      "Under Trump, there have been no new announcements of U.S. military or weapons aid to Ukraine. Between March and April, the United States allocated no new help at all, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks such support.",
      "For the first time since June 2022, four months after Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion, European countries have surpassed the U.S. in total military aid, totaling 72 billion euros ($85 billion) compared with 65 billion euros ($77 billion) from the U.S., the institute said last month.",
      "Without Patriot missiles, as well as the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile and shorter-range Stinger missiles that are also included in the pause, Ukrainian cities likely will take a bashing as more Russian missiles pierce air defenses.",
      "On the front line, Ukrainian troops haven\u2019t recently voiced complaints about ammunition shortages, as they have in the past. They have always said that during the war, they have never had as much ammunition to as their disposal as Russian forces.",
      "The army faces a different problem: It's desperately short-handed. It's turning to drones to compensate for its manpower shortage, and analysts say the front isn't about to collapse.",
      "Asked about the timing of the U.S. pause, the Ukrainian official emphasized the need for stable, reliable supply lines.",
      "\u201cThis is war \u2014 and in war, steady deliveries are always crucial,\u201d he said.",

      "Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July",
      "NEW YORK -- Americans have one more reason to celebrate this Fourth of July: getting all the gear needed to host a pool party costs less than it has in years, according to a market research company's preliminary data.",
      "The total price to buy beach towels, a beverage cooler, bathing suits and other accountrements of summer fun averaged $858 in June, the lowest amount for the month since 2020, consumer data provider Numerator said in an analysis prepared for The Associated Press.",
      "The finding from the firm's seasonal snapshot comports with broader economic measures indicating that U.S. consumers so far have not seen major impacts from President Donald Trump's vigorous application of tariffs on foreign goods.",
      "Numerator tracks U.S. retail prices through sales receipts, online account activity and other information from a panel of 200,000 shoppers. To see how prices are shaping up for the summer, the company looked at the average purchase price for 16 seasonal items typically made in China.",
      "Along with four towels, a cooler and bathing suits for two adults and a toddler, the hypothetical shopping list for a poolside gathering included a grill, four patio chairs, four cushions, a patio umbrella and four outdoor pillows. Recreation supplies included a cornhole set, two pairs of swim goggles, a set of diving rings, two beach balls and two pool floats or noodles.",
      "Leo Feler, Numerator\u2019s chief economist, offered a few theories for why buying all that stuff cost 11% less last month than it did in June 2023, when the average cost reached a high of $966, and 8.4% less than it did in June 2024.",
      "Wholesale suppliers and retailers that order from Chinese manufacturers may have imported too much stock while trying to stay ahead of high tariff bills, Feler said. As declining consumer confidence measures pointed to the possibility of weak sales, those businesses might have offered early discounts rather than risking their merchandise going unsold, he said.",
      "Given wide swings in Trump\u2019s trade posture toward China, retail vendors may have decided to absorb any initial tariff costs instead of trying to figure out how much more to charge their business customers, Feler said. The tariff rate on Chinese products soared to 145% in April before China and the U.S. reached a deal last month that brought the overall rate down to 55%.",
      "Suppliers often work on six-month contracts that are signed in January or February and again in June or July. That means many contracts for patio tables and chairs, for example, were signed before the White House included metal furniture in the aluminum or steel products that would be subject to a 25% tariff that went up to 50% last month.",
      "Customers who want to buy a new set of beach towels or to replace an old cooler still might want to hold off until August since prices will get lower in late summer, Feler said. But waiting until next year may prove costly, if the tariffs on products from China remain in place, he said.",
      "Just because preparing for a backyard bash might be comparatively less expensive right now, many economists and retail industry analysts still expect consumers to feel the weight of Trump's favorite trade negotiation tool. Shoppers are likely to see higher prices for back-to-school items starting in July and August, according to Feler.",
      "The time it's taking for the extra taxes on imports to reach stores could turn out like the pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions that contributed to U.S. inflation in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like there was a sudden surge,\" Feler said. \"It was a few prices increased here, then a few more prices, and a few other prices, and a couple more prices. And it started gaining speed.\u201d",

      "No illnesses have been confirmed to date, U.S. agriculture department officials said.",
      "Kraft Heinz Food Company of Newberry, South Carolina, announced the recall of the fully cooked turkey bacon that was produced from April 24 to June 11. The problem was discovered when the company\u2019s laboratory testing indicated potential listeria contamination.",
      "The recall includes the following products, which were shipped to U.S. stores nationwide, as well as the British Virgin Islands and Hong Kong:",
      "\u2014 12-ounce packages of Oscar Mayer Turkey Bacon Original with the UPC code 071871548601 printed on the package under the bar code. They have use-by dates from July 18 to Aug. 2 and the lot code RS40.",

      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has accused states and schools of using federal education grants earmarked for immigrants\u2019 children and low-income students to help fund \u201ca radical leftwing agenda.\u201d",
      "The administration this week withheld more than $6 billion intended for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more, saying it would review the grants to ensure they align with President Donald Trump\u2019s priorities. The freeze sent schools and summer camp providers scrambling to determine whether they can still provide programs like day camps this summer or after-hours child care this fall.",
      "On Wednesday, the Office of Management and Budget said an initial review showed schools used some of the money to support immigrants in the country illegally or promote LGBTQ+ inclusion. The administration said it hadn't made any final decisions about whether to withhold or release individual grants.",
      "\u201cMany of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,\u201d the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement.",
      "It said New York schools had used money for English language instruction to promote organizations that advocate for immigrants in the country illegally. Washington state used the money to direct immigrants without legal status toward scholarships the Trump administration says were \u201cintended for American students.\u201d Grant funds also were used for a seminar on \u201cqueer resistance in the arts,\u201d the office said.",
      "Officials from New York and Washington state didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Advocates for low-income and immigrant children connected the grant freeze to the Trump administration's larger crackdown on immigrants. Two of the five federal programs put on hold were appropriated by Congress to help support English proficiency of students still learning the language and migrant children who move with their parents to follow agricultural and other jobs.",
      "School districts use the $890 million earmarked for English learners in a wide range of purposes, from training teachers' aides who work with English learners, to running summer schools designed for them, to hiring family liaisons who speak the parents\u2019 native languages. The $375 million appropriated for migrant education is often used to hire dedicated teachers to travel close to where students live.",
      "By \u201ccherrypicking extreme examples,\u201d the administration is seeking to conflate all students learning English with people who are in the country illegally, said Amaya Garcia, who directs education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, D.C.",
      "In reality, the majority of English learners in public schools were born in the United States, according to data from the Migration Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cThe way they\u2019re framing it is that we\u2019re using this money for undocumented students and families,\" said Margarita Machado-Casas, president of the National Association of Bilingual Educators. \"It\u2019s a distraction. A distraction from what\u2019s actually happening: that 5.3 million English learners who speak lots of different languages, not just Spanish, will suffer.\u201d",
      "Even if the students lack legal status, states may not deny public education to children in the country illegally under a 1982 Supreme Court decision known as Plyler v. Doe. Conservative politicians in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee have pursued policies that question whether immigrants without legal residency should have the right to a public education, raising the possibility of challenges to that landmark ruling.",
      "Meanwhile, states and school districts are still trying to understand what it will mean for their students and their staff if these funds never arrive.",
      "In Oregon, eliminating grants for English learners and migrant students would \"undermine the state\u2019s efforts to increase academic outcomes for multilingual students, promote multilingualism, close opportunity gaps and provide targeted support to mobile and vulnerable student groups,\u201d said Liz Merah, spokeswoman for the state's Department of Education.",

      "The decision appears on a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage but as of Wednesday wasn\u2019t on the agency\u2019s official adult immunization schedule.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, typically is a coldlike nuisance, but it can be severe, even life-threatening, for infants and older adults. The CDC recommends vaccination for certain pregnant women and a onetime shot for everyone 75 or older. But people as young as 60 with health problems that increase their risk can also get it.",
      "In April, the CDC\u2019s influential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended expanding RSV vaccination to high-risk adults as young as 50, too. But the CDC lacks a director to decide whether to adopt that recommendation and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. didn\u2019t immediately act.",
      "Last month, Kennedy fired all 17 members of that panel and handpicked seven replacements that include several vaccine skeptics.",
      "The new panel alarmed doctors' groups last week by ignoring settled science on a rarely used flu vaccine preservative and by announcing a probe of the children\u2019s vaccine schedule. It didn't revisit RSV vaccination for older adults.",
      "Kennedy already had taken the unusual step of changing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations without consulting the committee.",
      "On Wednesday, a page on CDC's website said that on June 25, Kennedy had adopted the ousted panel's recommendation to expand RSV vaccination to high-risk 50-somethings and it is \u201cnow an official recommendation of the CDC.\u201d",

      "Vietnamese exports to the United States, by contrast, would face a 20% levy.",
      "On his Truth Social platform, Trump declared the pact \"a Great Deal of Cooperation between our two Countries.''",
      "In April, Trump announced a 46% tax on Vietnamese imports \u2014 one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the United States runs trade deficits. Trump promptly suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to allow for negotiations like the one with Vietnam. The pause expires Tuesday, but so far the Trump administration has reached a trade agreement with only one of those countries \u2014 the United Kingdom. (Trump has also reached a \"framework'' agreement with China in a separate trade dispute.)",
      "\u201cVietnam has been very keen to get out from under this,'' said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201dThis is forcing a smaller country to eat it, basically. We can do that. It's the big countries that everybody's keeping their eyes on.'' She doubts that Trump will be able to impose such a lopsided agreement on big trading partners such as the European Union and Japan.",
      "The United States last year ran a $122 billion trade deficit with Vietnam. That was the third-biggest U.S. trade gap \u2014 the difference between the goods and services it buys from other countries and those it sells them \u2014 behind the ones with China and Mexico.",
      "In addition to the 20% tariffs, Trump said the U.S. would impose a 40% tax on \"transshipping'' \u2014 goods from another country that stop in Vietnam on their way to the United States. Washington complains that Chinese goods have been dodging higher U.S. tariffs by transiting through Vietnam.",

      "\u201cThe medications should be available, the question is at what price and can people sustain that,\u201d said Matt Maciejewski, a Duke University professor who studies obesity treatment coverage.",

      "But most state and federally funded Medicaid programs don\u2019t cover the drugs for obesity and neither does Medicare, the federal program mainly for people age 65 and older.",
      "Even the plans that cover the drugs often pay only a portion of the bill, exposing patients to hundreds of dollars in monthly costs, said Dr. Beverly Tchang.",
      "Drugmakers offer help with these out-of-pocket costs, but that assistance can be limited.",
      "\u201cCoverage is not the same as access,\u201d said Tchang, a New York-based doctor who serves as a paid advisor to both Novo and Lilly.",
      "Bill-payers like employers are nervous about drugs that might be used by a lot of people indefinitely.",
      "Some big employers have dropped coverage of the drugs due to the expense. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, also are starting to pick one brand over the other as they negotiate deals with the drugmakers.",
      "One of the nation\u2019s largest PBMs, run by CVS Health, dropped Zepbound from its national formulary, or list of covered drugs, on July 1 in favor of Wegovy.",
      "That forced Tchang to figure out another treatment plan for several patients, many of whom took Zepbound because it made them less nauseous.",
      "Dr. Courtney Younglove\u2019s office sends prospective patients a video link showing them how to check their insurer\u2019s website for coverage of the drugs before they visit.",
      "\u201cThen some of them just cancel their appointment because they don\u2019t have coverage,\u201d the Overland Park, Kansas, doctor said.",
      "Compounding pharmacies and other entities were allowed to make off-brand, cheaper copies of Wegovy and Zepbound when there was a shortage of the drugs. But the U.S. Food and Drug Administration determined earlier this year that the shortage had ended.",
      "That should have ended the compounded versions, but there is an exception: Some compounding is permitted when a drug is personalized for the patient.",
      "The health care company Hims & Hers Health offers compounded doses of semaglutide, the drug behind Wegovy, that adjust dose levels to help patients manage side effects. Hims says these plans start at $165 a month for 12 months, with customers paying in full upfront.",
      "It\u2019s a contentious issue. Eli Lilly has sued pharmacies and telehealth companies trying to stop them from selling compounded versions of its products.",
      "Novo recently ended a short-lived partnership with Hims to sell Wegovy because the telehealth company continued compounding. Novo says the compounded versions of its drug put patient safety at risk because ingredients are made by foreign suppliers not monitored by US regulators.",
      "Hims says it checks all ingredients to make sure they meet U.S. quality and safety standards. It also uses a third-party lab to verify that a drug's strength is accurately labeled.",
      "Both drugmakers are selling most of their doses for around $500 a month to people without insurance, a few hundred dollars less than some initial prices.",
      "Even so, that expense would eat up about 14% of the average annual per person income in the U.S., which is around $43,000.",
      "There are some factors that may suppress prices over time. Both companies are developing pill versions of their treatments. Those could hit the market in the next year or so, which might drive down prices for the older, injectable doses.",
      "Younglove said some of her patients save as much as 15% by getting their doses shipped from a pharmacy in Canada. They used to get them from an Israeli pharmacy until the Canadians dropped their prices.",
      "She says competition like this, plus the introduction of pill versions, will pressure U.S. prices.",

      "With the money involved and the field trimmed to eight drivers, there could be more moments like the duel between Bowman and Wallace in the final weeks of the challenge.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that to happen or to get raced like that, but we did,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWe just have to move on from it and keep digging.\u201d",
      "It sure sounds as if Dillon is enjoying the competition. Dillon, the No. 32 seed, eliminated Brad Keselowski on Sunday after he upset top-seeded Denny Hamlin at Atlanta on June 28.",

      "But Djokovic turned things around enough to grab the middle two sets and then really took control after trailing 4-1 in the fourth. He won the last five games and 14 of the final 15 points.",
      "His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy.

      "At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel \u2014 usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions \u2014 on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.",
      "This could have been Djokovic\u2019s soonest setback at Wimbledon since he was eliminated in the third round by Sam Querrey nine years ago. That one was even more shocking, because it ended Djokovic\u2019s 30-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included championships at the preceding four major tournaments in a row, making him the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold each of those trophies simultaneously.",

      "He\u2019s come close to raising his total, finishing as the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon last year \u2014 the second consecutive time they met in the final, with the results the same \u2014 and departing each of the first two Slams of 2025 in the semifinals: he stopped with a hurt hamstring at the Australian Open in January and lost to No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the French Open last month.",
      "No man as old as Djokovic is now has won a major championship.",
      "He keeps showing why it's not preposterous to think he could, though, such as his diving volley winner earlier in the tournament or the way Djokovic broke to lead 2-1 in the second set on a 35-stroke exchange Monday. He put his right index finger to his ear and waved his arms to ask for noise from the spectators.",
      "The comeback officially was on, and soon enough, he was closing the third set with a winner to cap a 27-shot point.",
      "By the very end, it's almost as though de Minaur was resigned to defeat, knowing he's only the latest \u2014 and perhaps not the last \u2014 opponent to succumb to a surging Djokovic.",

      "The first-time captain of South Africa was on 367, just 33 runs away from tying the highest individual test score, Brian Lara's 400 not out 21 years ago, when he stopped his epic innings and declared at lunch with South Africa on 626-5.",

      "\u201cFirst, I thought we have enough and we need to bowl,\u201d Mulder said. \"Secondly, Brian Lara is a legend, he got 400 against England and for someone of that stature to keep that record is pretty special. If I get the chance again I'd probably do the same thing.",
      "\u201cI was speaking to Shuks (Proteas coach Shukri Conrad) and he kind of said to me as well, \u2018Let the legends keep the really big scores,' and you never know what my fate is or what is destined for me. But Brian Lara keeping that record is exactly the way it should be.\u201d",
      "Mulder achieved the fifth highest test score, and the highest by a South African.",
      "He started day two on 264 and the second new ball only eight overs old. But he picked up where he left off on Sunday, plundering the Zimbabwe bowlers.",
      "When he became the second South African to the 300 landmark, guiding Tanaka Chivanga's yorker to fine leg for a single, he took off his helmet, smiled and raised his bat to bathe in the applause.",
      "\u201cI never even dreamt of getting a double hundred never mind a triple hundred but it's super special,\u201d Mulder said. \u201cThe most important thing is it put the team in a good position to hopefully win the test.\u201d",

    "summary": "The All England Club is blaming human error for a glaring mistake by the electronic system that replaced human line judges this year at Wimbledon",
    "story": [
      "The All England Club is blaming human error for a glaring mistake by the electronic system that replaced human line judges this year at Wimbledon",
      "LONDON -- The All England Club, somewhat ironically, is blaming \u201chuman error\u201d for a glaring mistake by the electronic system that replaced human line judges this year at Wimbledon.",
      "The CEO of the club, Sally Bolton, said Monday that the ball-tracking technology was \"inadvertently deactivated\" by someone for three points at Centre Court during Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova's three-set victory over Sonay Kartal a day earlier in the fourth round. On one point, a shot by Kartal clearly landed past the baseline but wasn't called out by the automated setup \u2014 called Hawk-Eye \u2014 because it had been shut off.",
      "Bolton declined to say who made the mistake or how, exactly, it occurred or whether that person would face any consequences or be re-trained. She did note that there were other people at fault: the chair umpire, Nico Helwerth, and two who should have let him know the system was temporarily down \u2014 the review official and the Hawk-Eye official.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t need to put line judges back on the court again,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cWe needed the system to be active.\u201d",
      "Not really. But like most big tennis tournaments nowadays \u2014 the French Open is one notable exception \u2014 Wimbledon has replaced its line judges with cameras that are supposed to follow the balls on every shot to determine whether they land in or out.",
      "There are those, particularly in the British media, who keep referring to this as part of the ever-increasing creep of AI into day-to-day life, but Bolton objected to the use of that term in this case.",
      "\u201cThe point I would want to emphasize \u2014 and perhaps contrary to some of the reporting we\u2019ve seen \u2014 is it\u2019s not an artificial intelligence system. And it is electronic in the sense that the camera-tracking technology is set up to call the lines automatically, but it requires a human element to ensure that the system is functional,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cSo it is not AI. There are some humans involved. And in this instance, it was a human error.\u201d",
      "Russia's Pavlyuchenkova was one point from winning a game for a 5-4 lead in the first set against Britain's Kartal on Sunday when a shot by Kartal landed long. But there was no ruling from Hawk-Eye.",
      "After a delay, Helwerth decided the point should be replayed, which Pavlyuchenkova thought showed bias toward an opponent competing in her home country. With Hawk-Eye back up and running after a delay, Kartal won that game, but Pavlyuchenkova took that set and the match.",
      "The All England Club looked into what happened and found that the line-calling system actually was off for three points before anyone noticed.",
      "The system itself worked \u201coptimally,\u201d Bolton said repeatedly.",
      "\u201cIn this instance, sadly,\u201d she said, \u201cit was the human part of the operation that made a mistake.\u201d",
      "Bolton said the system is shut down between matches \u2014 \u201cand the humans are the people that need to do the activating and deactivating\" \u2014 and someone accidentally did so during Pavlyuchenkova vs. Kartal.",
      "Asked why, Bolton responded: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. It was a mistake, obviously. ... I wasn't sat there, so I don't know what happened.\"",
      "She said Helwerth could have made a ruling himself on the controversial non-call, the way he did on the prior pair of points, but instead just decided to pause the match.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m assuming,\u201d Bolton said, \u201che felt he had not seen it properly.\u201d",
      "Pavlyuchenkova said after the match the official told her he thought the ball was out.",
      "Players are divided on whether there even should be electronic rulings during matches \u2014 unless it is fool-proof \u2014 or whether there should be a return to Wimbledon's old way of doing things.",
      "Since 2007 through last year, there was a combination of the human touch and technology: There were line judges on court to make calls, but players were allowed to challenge and ask for a video replay of a point if they thought there was a mistake.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such a big match, big event,\u201d Pavlyuchenkova said. \u201cSince we have already automatic line-calling and so much invested into this, we should probably look into something else to have better decisions.\u201d",

      "It extended the win-or-bust season for Campbell, who won the Mexico Open in a playoff in late February. He has finished out of the top 30 every tournament except for his two victories.",
      "This one might be enough to get him into the British Open, depending on how high up he moves in the world ranking published Monday, traditionally used as the alternate list.",
      "Campbell appeared to have control of the tournament with three birdies in a four-hole stretch to start the back nine. But he fell back with a double bogey into the trees on the 15th, and it was a wild scramble to the finish.",
      "Grillo, who also closed with a 67, took the lead when Campbell made double bogey, only to three-putt for bogey on the 16th.",
      "Campbell, one of the shorter hitters on tour, blasted a 3-wood to 18 feet for a two-putt birdie on the par-5 17th and narrowly missed a 25-foot birdie on the 18th. He was the first player to post at 18-under 266.",
      "Grillo got up-and-down for birdie on the 17th, holing an 8-foot putt, and caught a bad break on the 18th when his drive settled into a divot. He hit wedge to just inside 40 feet and two-putted for par to join Campbell at 266.",
      "David Lipsky was poised to join them when he hit a punch 3-wood to 8 feet for eagle on the 17th to tie for the lead. But he hooked his drive on the 18th, couldn't reach the green, and his 15-foot par putt to get into the playoff caught the left lip and spun away. He shot 68 and tied for third with Kevin Roy (65).",
      "The playoff lacked any real drama. Campbell hit a beautiful trap draw to about 15 feet on the 18th. Grillo, who caught a break when his drive to the right was sitting up in trampled rough, sent long over the green. His flop shot didn't quite reach the putting surface, and his par attempt from some 25 feet never had a chance.",
      "\u201cI got myself there. I gave myself a chance,\u201d Grillo said. \u201cI made some good putts. Hit a good putt on the 72nd and that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d",
      "Campbell becomes the fifth player this year to have multiple victories in individual tournaments on the PGA Tour, joining Scottie Scheffler, Rory McIlroy, Sepp Straka and Ryan Fox.",
      "He finished about a half-hour ahead of the final group, but Campbell chose to stay in the clubhouse to see if his score would hold up instead of staying loose on the practice range. He said it was hot enough that it was better to cool off and get some rest, and there was no arguing with the result \u2014 he drilled his drive down the middle and put all the pressure on Grillo with his approach to the green.",
      "Max Homa, winless in more than two years, ran off three straight birdies early in the round to briefly take the lead. He played the last 14 holes in 1 over, missing key putts to stay in the game, and wound up with a 69 to tie for fifth. It was his first top 10 on the PGA Tour in nearly 15 months.",
      "Five others tied for fifth, including 47-year-old Matt Kuchar, who closed with a 66, and Lucas Glover, who shot a 64.",

    "story": [
      "Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo have been fired by the Washington Nationals amid their sixth consecutive losing season since they won the 2019 World Series",
      "WASHINGTON -- Manager Dave Martinez and general manager Mike Rizzo were fired by the Washington Nationals on Sunday in moves that were surprising for their timing, even if the club is more than halfway through its sixth consecutive losing season since winning the 2019 World Series.",
      "The team announced the changes just hours after Washington's 6-4 loss at home completed a sweep by the Boston Red Sox. The Nationals are 37-53 and last in the NL East; the only National League club with a worse record is the Colorado Rockies.",
      "But the amateur draft is just a week away, and Washington has the No. 1 overall pick.",
      "Senior VP and assistant GM Mike DeBartolo is taking over for Rizzo on an interim basis. A replacement for Martinez wasn't named immediately.",
      "Washington could have exercised options to extend the contracts of both Martinez and Rizzo beyond this season.",
      "\u201cWhile we are appreciative of their past successes,\" Nationals owner Mark Lerner said in a statement issued by the team, \"the on-field performance has not been where we or our fans expect it to be. This is a pivotal time for our club, and we believe a fresh approach and new energy is the best course of action for our team moving forward.\u201d",
      "Rizzo\u2019s time running the Nationals is over after more than a decade and a half. One of the Lerner family's first hires when it assumed control of the organization, Rizzo had been GM since 2009 and added the title of president of baseball operations in 2013.",
      "\u201cHe played an instrumental role in leading the transformation of our farm system and building a roster that reached an unprecedented level of organizational success,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cMike helped make us who we are as an organization, and we\u2019re so thankful to him for his hard work and dedication.\u201d",
      "Martinez is the fourth manager fired since the start of this season \u2014 after Pittsburgh\u2019s Derek Shelton, Colorado\u2019s Bud Black and Baltimore\u2019s Brandon Hyde.",
      "Martinez\u2019s full record with the Nationals was 500-622. Last month, he bristled at a reporter's question about how to split the blame for poor performance among players and his staff.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s never on coaching,\u201d Martinez said then. \u201cNever on coaching. Coaches work their (butts) off every single day. We\u2019re not going to finger point here and say it\u2019s coaches. It\u2019s never on the coaches. They work hard. The message is clear. All the work is done prior. So, sometimes, they have to go out there and play the game. It\u2019s always been about the players. Always.\u201d",
      "Martinez had never been a manager at any level when Rizzo hired him to replace Dusty Baker before the 2018 season. The Nationals went 82-80 in Martinez\u2019s first season and got off to a 19-31 start the following year, leading to some calls for him to be replaced.",
      "But Rizzo stuck with Martinez, and that decision paid off in a big way: Led by starting pitchers Stephen Strasburg, who earned World Series MVP honors, and Max Scherzer, rookie outfielder Juan Soto, young shortstop Trea Turner and a string of veterans \u2014 including Howie Kendrick, Ryan Zimmerman and Anthony Rendon \u2014 the Nationals won the franchise\u2019s first title.",
      "No one from the World Series roster is still playing for the franchise.",
      "Washington took a step back in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, and then Rizzo began tearing apart the roster, making a series of trades that sent Scherzer, Soto, Turner and others elsewhere.",
      "The reconstruction has continued, without much in the way of concrete progress in the standings to show for it, although the team does have some building blocks that show promise, including starter MacKenzie Gore and outfielder James Wood \u2014 both named NL All-Stars on Sunday \u2014 along with shortstop CJ Abrams, who was an All-Star a year ago.",
      "\u201cNationals fans have a lot to be optimistic about, and we see these changes as a difficult, but necessary move in a positive direction,\u201d Lerner said. \u201cAs has been the case since my late father took control of the team almost 20 years ago, our family remains committed to winning.\"",
      "Washington finished fourth or fifth in the NL East every year from 2020 through 2024, never putting together a higher winning percentage than the .438 (71-91) each of the last two seasons.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always appreciated and admired Davey\u2019s passion for the game of baseball and the love he has for his players,\" Lerner said. \"Davey\u2019s ability to connect with our staff, our players, our fans and our community set him apart. While this chapter has come to an end, we know that it doesn\u2019t close the book on what should continue to be a long and successful career in baseball.\u201d",

      "Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th All-Star Game, joining the roster as a Legend Pick by MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred",
      "NEW YORK -- Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was picked for his 11th All-Star Game and Paul Skenes, James Wood and Elly De La Cruz boosted the 23-and-under group to five when they were picked Sunday for the July 15 showcase at Atlanta's Truist Park.",
      "Wood at 22 is the youngest of the 65 All-Stars, while Skenes, De La Cruz and fan-elected starters Pete Crow-Armstrong and Jacob Wilson are all 23.",
      "Cal Raleigh and Yoshinobu Yamamoto joined Wood, Wilson and Crow-Armstrong among 19 first-time All-Stars. Wood was acquired by Washington in the August 2022 trade that sent outfielder Juan Soto to San Diego.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll just be cool being around some of the best players in the game,\u201d Wood said.",
      "Kershaw last week became the 20th pitcher to reach 3,000 strikeouts and Commissioner Rob Manfred made the left-hander the 65th All-Star as a so-called Legend Pick, his first since selecting Miguel Cabrera and Albert Pujols in 2022 under a provision in the then-new collective bargaining agreement.",
      "Kershaw gives the Dodgers at least five All-Stars for the sixth straight season. The oldest NL All-Star at 37 and most senior All-Star with 11 selections, Kershaw is joined by Yamamoto and fan-elected starters Shohei Ohtani, Freddie Freeman and Will Smith.",
      "Kershaw said he didn't want to discuss the selection on Sunday.",
      "Pittsburgh's Skenes is willing to start his second straight All-Star Game if picked by Dave Roberts, the Dodgers manager in charge of the NL team.",
      "\u201cI think it would be stupid to say no to that. It\u2019s a pretty cool opportunity,\u201d Skenes said. \"I didn\u2019t make plans over the All-Star break or anything. So, yeah, I\u2019m super stoked.\u201d",
      "Detroit and Seattle will have four players each at the game.",
      "Starting pitchers Hunter Brown of Houston, Garrett Crochet of Boston, Jacob deGrom of Texas, Max Fried of the New York Yankees and Tarik Skubal of Detroit were voted to the AL staff by players, managers and coaches along with relievers Aroldis Chapman of Boston, Josh Hader of Houston and Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1oz of Seattle.",
      "Chapman is the oldest All-Star, born 19 days before Kershaw.",
      "AL reserves picked by players included Toronto catcher Alejandro Kirk, Tampa Bay first baseman Jonathan Aranda and second baseman Brandon Lowe, Houston shortstop Jeremy Pe\u00f1a, Boston third baseman Alex Bregman, Athletics designated hitter Brent Rooker and outfielders Byron Buxton of Minnesota, Steven Kwan of Cleveland and Julio Rodr\u00edguez of Seattle.",
      "MLB used its six picks on pitchers Kris Bubic of Kansas City, Yusei Kikuchi of the Los Angeles Angels, Shane Smith of the Chicago White Sox and Bryan Woo of Seattle, along with Yankees infielder Jazz Chisholm Jr. and Kansas City shortstop Bobby Witt Jr.",
      "\u201cRed carpet, that\u2019s my thing,\u201d Chisholm said. \u201cI do have a 'fit in mind.\u201d",
      "Smith became the second player since 2000 to become an All-Star in the season after he was selected in the Rule 5 draft, following Marlins second baseman Dan Uggla in 2006, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Smith was left unprotected by Milwaukee and joined Wilson (Athletics) as the only rookies on the All-Star rosters.",
      "Skenes, Washington's MacKenzie Gore, Atlanta's Chris Sale, San Francisco's Logan Webb and Philadelphia's Zack Wheeler were elected to the starting rotation by players along with relievers Jason Adam of San Diego, Edwin D\u00edaz of the New York Mets and Randy Rodr\u00edguez of San Francisco.",
      "Skenes started last year's All-Star Game just 66 days after his major league debut, pitching a hitless inning in the NL's 5-3 loss at Arlington, Texas.",
      "Player-elected NL reserves were Colorado catcher Hunter Goodman, Mets first baseman Pete Alonso, St. Louis second baseman Brendan Donovan, Cincinnati's De La Cruz at shortstop, Arizona third baseman Eugenio Su\u00e1rez, Philadelphia DH Kyle Schwarber and Wood, Arizona's Corbin Carroll and the Padres' Fernando Tatis Jr. in the outfield.",
      "MLB's NL picks were Yamamoto, the Cubs' Matthew Boyd, Milwaukee's Freddy Peralta and the Giants' Robbie Ray for the pitching staff along with Atlanta first baseman Matt Olson and Miami outfielder Kyle Stowers.",
      "Mets outfielder Juan Soto, Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts, Blue Jays outfielder George Springer, Phillies shortstop Trea Turner and Cardinals pitcher Sonny Gray were not picked. There usually are about 10 roster replacements between the announcements and the game.",

      "Shane van Gisbergen has completed a sweep on the Chicago Street Course, winning the NASCAR Cup Series race on the tricky downtown circuit",
      "CHICAGO -- Shane van Gisbergen burned out his tires in celebration, sending white smoke into the air. He signed a rugby ball and punted it into the stands in downtown Chicago.",
      "It was a familiar scene.",
      "Van Gisbergen completed a Windy City sweep Sunday, winning the NASCAR Cup Series race on the tricky street course in downtown Chicago.",
      "\u201cEpic weekend for us. I\u2019m a lucky guy,\u201d van Gisbergen said.",
      "A talented one, too.",
      "The 36-year-old New Zealand native became the second driver to sweep the Xfinity and Cup races in a single weekend from the pole, joining Kyle Busch at Indianapolis in 2016. With his third career Cup win, he also became the winningest foreign-born driver on NASCAR's top series.",
      "It was van Gisbergen's second victory of the season after the Trackhouse Racing driver also won last month on a Mexico City road course.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s the best road course stock car racer that I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Trackhouse owner Justin Marks said. \u201cI think when he\u2019s done with us all and walks away from the sport, I think he\u2019s going to walk away as the best road course racer that this sport has ever seen.\u201d",
      "Marks brought van Gisbergen over from Australia\u2019s Supercars for the first edition of NASCAR\u2019s Chicago experiment in 2023, and he became the first driver to win his Cup debut since Johnny Rutherford in the second qualifying race at Daytona in 1963.",
      "He also won Chicago\u2019s Xfinity Series stop last year and the first stage in the Cup race before he was knocked out by a crash.",
      "\u201cThis joint, it\u2019s changed my life,\u201d van Gisbergen said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any plans to do more NASCAR races when I first came over here, and I never thought I\u2019d be in NASCAR full time.\u201d",
      "In what might be the last NASCAR race on the downtown Chicago circuit, Ty Gibbs was second and Tyler Reddick finished third. Denny Hamlin and Kyle Busch rounded out the top five.",
      "\u201cMy team called a great strategy and got me in position to get me up front to compete for the win,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cIt worked out for us today, so I\u2019m glad to have a good finish, but we wish we could have gone for the win.\u201d",
      "Michael McDowell joined van Gisbergen on the front row and quickly moved in front. He won Stage 1 and led for 31 laps before he was derailed by a throttle cable issue.",
      "Van Gisbergen regained the lead when he passed Chase Briscoe with 16 laps left. As fog and rain moved into downtown Chicago, van Gisbergen controlled the action the rest of the way.",
      "AJ Allmendinger was sixth, and Ryan Preece finished seventh. Ryan Blaney, who won the second stage, was 12th.",
      "\u201cI thought overall it was a pretty decent day. It was nice to win that stage,\" Blaney said.",
      "William Byron's day was cut short by a clutch problem. The Hendrick Motorsports driver leads the point standings by 13 points over Chase Elliott.",
      "After McDowell seized the lead early in the race, Carson Hocevar caused a multicar crash when he hit the wall and spun out between Turns 10 and 11. Brad Keselowski, Austin Dillon, Daniel Su\u00e1rez and Will Brown were among the drivers collected in the wreck.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see it until the last second,\" Keselowski said. \"I slowed down and I actually felt I was going to get stopped and then I just kind of got ran over from behind. It\u2019s just a narrow street course and sometimes there\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d",
      "Ty Dillon and Reddick moved into the third round of NASCAR's inaugural in-season tournament when Keselowski and Hocevar were unable to finish the race. Dillon, the No. 32 seed, eliminated Keselowski after he upset top-seeded Denny Hamlin last weekend at Atlanta.",
      "Gibbs, Preece, Alex Bowman, John H. Nemechek, Zane Smith and Erik Jones also advanced. The winner of the five-race, bracket-style tournament takes home a $1 million prize.",
      "Bowman, the 2024 champion on the downtown street course, won his head-to-head matchup with Bubba Wallace. Bowman and Wallace made contact as they battled for position late in the race after they also tangled in Chicago last year.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting that to happen or to get raced like that, but we did,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cWe just have to move on from it and keep digging. I don\u2019t really know what I could have done much different.\u201d",
      "Katherine Legge finished 19th for her best career Cup result. She became the first woman to finish in the top 20 in a Cup race since Danica Patrick at Texas in November 2017.",
      "Legge was the first woman to qualify for the Cup race in downtown Chicago.",
      "The Cup Series is at Sonoma Raceway in California on Sunday, July 13.",

      "Kevin Durant\u2019s trade to the Houston Rockets is official and officially record-setting.",
      "The deal got approved by the NBA on Sunday as part of a seven-team transaction, one in which a slew of other trade agreements got folded into one massive package.",
      "\u201cKevin impacts the game on both ends of the court and is one of the most efficient scorers in the history of basketball,\u201d Rockets general manager Rafael Stone said. \u201cWe liked the growth our team showed last season and believe Kevin\u2019s skill set will integrate seamlessly.\u201d",
      "Involved in the deal: Phoenix, Houston, Atlanta, Minnesota, Golden State, Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers. It includes a total of 13 players \u2014 the headline moves include Durant going to Houston from Phoenix, the Rockets sending Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks to the Suns, and the Rockets acquiring Clint Capela from the Hawks.",
      "The seven-team involvement in the Durant trade tops the previous record, a six-team transaction last summer that most notably sent Klay Thompson to the Dallas Mavericks. Golden State \u2014 Thompson\u2019s former team \u2014 obviously was another part of that trade, as were Charlotte, Minnesota, Philadelphia and Denver on varying levels.",
      "\u201cOne of the greatest to ever play the game, we are grateful for the impact Kevin made on our organization and in our community,\u201d Phoenix general manager Brian Gregory said of Durant. \u201cAs a member of the Suns, he climbed the scoring charts to become just the eighth player in NBA history to score 30,000 career points, and we wish him the best as he continues his career in Houston.\u201d",
      "There will be at least five second-round draft picks in the deal before all terms are satisfied, the potential for another second-round pick swap and the Hawks and Timberwolves both had to receive some cash considerations to make all the math work. And some of those draft picks won\u2019t actually be made until 2032, which raises the serious possibility that some players who will go down in history as being part of the trade haven\u2019t reached high school yet.",
      "Durant averaged 26.6 points last season, his 17th in the NBA \u2014 not counting one year missed because of injury. For his career, the 6-foot-11 forward is averaging 27.2 points and seven rebounds per game.",
      "The move brings Durant back to the state of Texas, where he played his only year of college basketball for the Longhorns and was the college player of the year before going as the No. 2 pick in the 2007 draft by Seattle.",
      "Houston becomes his fifth franchise, joining the SuperSonics (who then became the Oklahoma City Thunder), Golden State, Brooklyn and Phoenix. Durant won his two titles with the Warriors in 2017 and 2018, and last summer in Paris he became the highest-scoring player in U.S. Olympic basketball history and the first men\u2019s player to be part of four gold-medal teams.",
      "Durant is a four-time scoring champion, a two-time Finals MVP and one of eight players in NBA history with more than 30,000 career points.",
      "\u201cHaving played against Kevin and coached him before, I know he\u2019s the type of competitor who fits with what we\u2019ve been building here in Houston,\u201d Rockets coach Ime Udoka said. \u201cHis skill level, love of basketball, and dedication to his craft have made him one of the most respected players of his generation, and my staff and I are excited to work with him.\u201d",
      "Houston sent Green and Brooks to Phoenix, along with the rights to Khaman Maluach from last month's draft, a second-round pick in 2026 and another second-rounder in 2032. The Hawks got David Roddy, cash and a 2031 second-round pick swap from the Rockets. Brooklyn gets a 2026 second-round pick and another in 2030 from the Rockets, and the Warriors received the rights to Jahmai Mashack from last month's draft.",

      "The oldest Grand Slam tournament is the only one of the four that holds its qualifying rounds at a completely separate location. There are also too few practice courts in the current setup, requiring some of the world\u2019s best players to share courts.",
      "\u201cWimbledon needs to stay at the pinnacle of world sport, and to do that, you have to evolve both on the court but also off the court with the infrastructure,\u201d Debbie Jevans, chair of the All England Club, told The Associated Press.",
      "Wimbledon\u2019s attendance numbers trail the other three majors. The Australian Open sold 1.1 million tickets for this year\u2019s main draw \u2014 more than double Wimbledon\u2019s 2024 tally \u2014 after bringing in more than 115,000 the week of qualifying.

The demand for our tickets is off the charts.\u201d",
      "An 8,000-seat arena would become Wimbledon's third-largest stadium after Centre Court and No. 1 Court; it would be located just across the street from No. 1 Court.",

    "story": [
      "A stark disagreement over regulating AI in Republicans\u2019 tax cut and spending bill is the latest tension among conservatives about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference",
      "NEW YORK -- A controversial bid to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade seemed on its way to passing as the Republican tax cut and spending bill championed by President Donald Trump worked its way through the U.S. Senate.",
      "But as the bill neared a final vote, a relentless campaign against it by a constellation of conservatives \u2014 including Republican governors, lawmakers, think tanks and social groups \u2014 had been eroding support. One, conservative activist Mike Davis, appeared on the show of right-wing podcaster Steve Bannon, urging viewers to call their senators to reject this \u201cAI amnesty\u201d for \u201ctrillion-dollar Big Tech monopolists.\u201d",
      "He said he also texted with Trump directly, advising the president to stay neutral on the issue despite what Davis characterized as significant pressure from White House AI czar David Sacks, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and others.",
      "Conservatives passionate about getting rid of the provision had spent weeks fighting others in the party who favored the legislative moratorium because they saw it as essential for the country to compete against China in the race for AI dominance. The schism marked the latest and perhaps most noticeable split within the GOP about whether to let states continue to put guardrails on emerging technologies or minimize such interference.",
      "In the end, the advocates for guardrails won, revealing the enormous influence of a segment of the Republican Party that has come to distrust Big Tech. They believe states must remain free to protect their citizens against potential harms of the industry, whether from AI, social media or emerging technologies.",
      "\u201cTension in the conservative movement is palpable,\u201d said Adam Thierer of the R Street Institute, a conservative-leaning think tank. Thierer first proposed the idea of the AI moratorium last year. He noted \u201cthe animus surrounding Big Tech\u201d among many Republicans.",
      "\"That was the differentiating factor.\u201d",
      "The Heritage Foundation, children\u2019s safety groups and Republican state lawmakers, governors and attorneys general all weighed in against the AI moratorium. Democrats, tech watchdogs and some tech companies opposed it, too.",
      "Sensing the moment was right on Monday night, Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, who opposed the AI provision and had attempted to water it down, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington to suggest striking the entire proposal. By morning, the provision was removed in a 99-1 vote.",
      "The whirlwind demise of a provision that initially had the backing of House and Senate leadership and the White House disappointed other conservatives who felt it gave China, a main AI competitor, an advantage.",
      "Ryan Fournier, chairman of Students for Trump and chief marketing officer of the startup Uncensored AI, had supported the moratorium, writing on X that it \u201cstops blue states like California and New York from handing our future to Communist China.\u201d",
      "\u201cRepublicans are that way ... I get it,\u201d he said in an interview, but added there needs to be \u201cone set of rules, not 50\u201d for AI innovation to be successful.",
      "Tech companies, tech trade groups, venture capitalists and multiple Trump administration figures had voiced their support for the provision that would have blocked states from passing their own AI regulations for years. They argued that in the absence of federal standards, letting the states take the lead would leave tech innovators mired in a confusing patchwork of rules.",
      "Lutnick, the commerce secretary, posted that the provision \u201cmakes sure American companies can develop cutting-edge tech for our military, infrastructure, and critical industries \u2014 without interference from anti-innovation politicians.\u201d AI czar Sacks had also publicly supported the measure.",
      "After the Senate passed the bill without the AI provision, the White House responded to an inquiry for Sacks with the president's position, saying Trump \"is fully supportive of the Senate-passed version of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Acknowledging defeat of his provision on the Senate floor, Cruz noted how pleased China, liberal politicians and \u201cradical left-wing groups\u201d would be to hear the news.",
      "But Blackburn pointed out that the federal government has failed to pass laws that address major concerns about AI, such as keeping children safe and securing copyright protections.",
      "\u201cBut you know who has passed it?\u201d she said. \u201cThe states.\u201d",
      "Conservatives distrusting Big Tech for what they see as social media companies stifling speech during the COVID-19 pandemic and surrounding elections said that tech companies shouldn\u2019t get a free pass, especially on something that carries as much risk as AI.",
      "Many who opposed the moratorium also brought up preserving states' rights, though proponents countered that AI issues transcend state borders and Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce.",
      "Eric Lucero, a Republican state lawmaker in Minnesota, noted that many other industries already navigate different regulations established by both state and local jurisdictions.",
      "\u201cI think everyone in the conservative movement agrees we need to beat China,\" said Daniel Cochrane from the Heritage Foundation. \u201cI just think we have different prescriptions for doing so.\u201d",
      "Many argued that in the absence of federal legislation, states were best positioned to protect citizens from the potential harms of AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states hands is potentially dangerous,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene wrote on X.",
      "Another Republican, Texas state Sen. Angela Paxton, wrote to Cruz and his counterpart, Sen. John Cornyn, urging them to remove the moratorium.",
      "She and other conservatives said some sort of federal standard could help clarify the landscape around AI and resolve some of the party's disagreements.",
      "But with the moratorium dead and Republicans holding only narrow majorities in both chambers of Congress, it\u2019s unclear whether they will be able to agree on a set of standards to guide the development of the burgeoning technology.",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, Paxton said she wants to see limited federal AI legislation \u201cthat sets some clear guardrails\u201d around national security and interstate commerce, while leaving states free to address issues that affect their residents.",
      "\"When it comes to technology as powerful and potentially dangerous as AI, we should be cautious about silencing state-level efforts to protect consumers and children,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "A startup called Gigablue claims to have reached a milestone by selling 200,000 carbon credits for its ocean-based carbon capture technology",
      "The startup Gigablue announced with fanfare this year that it reached a historic milestone: selling 200,000 carbon credits to fund what it describes as a groundbreaking technology in the fight against climate change.",
      "Formed three years ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Israel, the company says it has designed particles that when released in the ocean will trap carbon at the bottom of the sea. By \u201charnessing the power of nature,\u201d Gigablue says, its work will do nothing less than save the planet.",
      "But outside scientists frustrated by the lack of information released by the company say serious questions remain about whether Gigablue\u2019s technology works as the company describes. Their questions showcase tensions in an industry built on little regulation and big promises \u2014 and a tantalizing chance to profit.",
      "Jimmy Pallas, an event organizer based in Italy, struck a deal with Gigablue last year. He said he trusts the company does what it has promised him \u2014 ensuring the transportation, meals, and electricity of a recent 1,000-person event will be offset by particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s service is like \u201can extra trash can\u201d where Pallas can discard his unwanted emissions, he said.",
      "\u201cSame way I use my trash can \u2014 I don\u2019t follow where the truck that comes and picks up my trash brings it to,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll take their word for it.\u201d",
      "Gigablue has a grand vision for the future of carbon removal. It was originally named \u201cGigaton\u201d after the one billion metric tons of carbon dioxide most scientists say will be necessary to remove from the atmosphere each year to slow global warming.",
      "The company began trials in the South Pacific Ocean last year, and says it will work with country authorities to create a \u201csequestration field\u201d \u2014 a dedicated part of the ocean where \u201cpulses\u201d of particles will be released on a seasonal basis.",
      "Gigablue says its solution is affordable, too \u2014 priced to attract investors.",
      "\u201cEvery time we go to the ocean, we generate hundreds of thousands of carbon credits, and this is what we\u2019re going to do continuously over the upcoming years and towards the future, in greater and greater quantities,\u201d co-founder Ori Shaashua said.",
      "Carbon credits, which have grown in popularity over the last decade, are tokens that symbolize the removal of one metric ton of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. On paper, companies that buy credits achieve a smaller carbon footprint without needing to reduce their own emissions \u2014 for instance, by paying another vendor to plant trees or capture carbon dioxide from the air.",
      "Only a few countries have required local industries to purchase carbon credits. Most companies that buy them, including Microsoft and Google, do so voluntarily.",
      "The credits have helped fund a band of startups like Gigablue that are eager to tackle the climate crisis, but they are also unevenly regulated, scientifically complex, and have in some cases been linked to fraud.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s 200,000 credits are pledged to SkiesFifty, a newly formed company investing in greener practices for the aviation industry. It\u2019s the largest sale to date for a climate startup operating in the ocean, according to the tracking site CDR.fyi, making up more than half of all ocean-based carbon credits sold last year.",
      "And it could beckon a rapid acceleration of the company\u2019s work. Gigablue hopes to reach a goal this year of capturing 10 metric tons of carbon dioxide for each ton of particles it deploys, Shaashua said. At that rate, Gigablue would disperse at least 20,000 tons of particles in the ocean.",
      "Gigablue wouldn\u2019t reveal what it earned in the sale, and SkiesFifty\u2019s team declined to be interviewed for this story. Most credits are sold for a few hundred dollars each \u2014 but a chart on Gigablue\u2019s website suggests its prices are lower than almost any other form of carbon capture on the market.",
      "The startup is the brainchild of four entrepreneurs hailing from the tech industry. According to their LinkedIn profiles, Gigablue\u2019s CEO previously worked for an online grocery startup, while its COO was vice president of SeeTree, a company that raised $60 million to provide farmers with information on their trees.",
      "Shaashua, who often serves as the face of Gigablue, said he specializes in using artificial intelligence to pursue positive outcomes in the world. He co-founded a data mining company that tracked exposure risks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and led an auto startup that brokered data on car mileage and traffic patterns.",
      "\u201cThree years ago, I decided to take the same formula, so to say, to climate,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Under his guidance, he said, Gigablue created an AI-driven \u201cdigital twin\u201d of the ocean based on dozens of metrics to determine where to release the particles.",
      "Chief technology officer Sapir Markus-Alford earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in earth and environmental sciences from Israel\u2019s Ben-Gurion University in 2021, shortly before founding Gigablue.",
      "Markus-Alford said she began her studies and eventual path to Gigablue after seeing bleached coral reefs and other impacts of warming waters on a series of diving trips around the world.",
      "\u201cI understood that the best thing we could do for the ocean is to be able to remove CO2,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "A spokesperson for Gigablue did not answer whether the other co-founders have graduate degrees in oceanography or environmental science, but said the company\u2019s broader team holds a total of 46 Ph.D.s with expertise in biology, chemistry, oceanography, and environmental science. Markus-Alford said that figure includes outside experts and academics and \u201ceveryone that supports us.\u201d",
      "The company\u2019s staffing has expanded from Israel to hubs in New York and New Zealand, Shaashua said.",
      "In social media posts advertising open jobs, Gigablue employees encouraged applicants to \u201cJoin Our Mission to Save the World!\u201d",
      "The particles Gigablue has patented are meant to capture carbon in the ocean by floating for a number of days and growing algae, before sinking rapidly to the ocean floor.",
      "\u201cWe are an elevator for carbon,\u201d Shaashua said. \u201cWe are exporting the carbon from the top to the bottom.\u201d",
      "Algae \u2014 sometimes referred to as phytoplankton \u2014 has long been attractive to climate scientists because it absorbs carbon dioxide from the surrounding water as it grows. If the algae sinks to the deep sea or ocean floor, Gigablue expects the carbon to be trapped there for hundreds to thousands of years.",
      "The ultimate goal is to lower carbon dioxide levels so drastically that the ocean rebalances with the atmosphere by soaking up more CO2 from the air. It\u2019s a feat that would help slow climate change, but one that is still under active study by climate scientists.",
      "Gigablue\u2019s founders have said the company\u2019s work is inspired by nature and \u201cvery, very environmentally safe.\u201d The company\u2019s particles and sinking methods simply recreate what nature has been doing \u201csince forever,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Gigablue ran its first trial sinking particles in the Mediterranean in March last year.",
      "Later, on two voyages to the South Pacific, the company released 60 cubic meters \u2014 about two shipping containers \u2014 of particles off the coast of New Zealand.",
      "While Gigablue has made several commercial deals, it has not yet revealed what its particles are made of. Partly this is because the company says it will build different particles tailored to different seasons and areas of the ocean.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s proprietary,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "Documents provide a window into the possible ingredients. According to information on the permit, Gigablue\u2019s first New Zealand trial last year involved releasing particles of pure vermiculite, a porous clay often used in potting soil.",
      "In the second New Zealand trial, the company released particles made of vermiculite, ground rock, a plant-based wax, as well as manganese and iron.",
      "A patent published last year hints the particles could also be made of scores of other materials, including cotton, rice husks or jute, as well as synthetic ingredients like polyester fibers or lint. The particles contain a range of possible binding agents, and up to 18 different chemicals and metals, from iron to nickel to vanadium.",
      "Without specifying future designs, Markus-Alford said Gigablue\u2019s particles meet certain requirements: \u201cAll the materials we use are materials that are natural, nontoxic, nonhazardous, and can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said. She wouldn\u2019t comment on the possible use of cotton or rice, but said the particles won\u2019t include any kind of plastic.",
      "When asked about vermiculite, which is typically mined on land and heated to expand, Markus-Alford said rivers and erosion transport most materials including vermiculite to the ocean. \u201cAlmost everything, basically, that exists on land can be found in the ocean,\u201d she said.",
      "The company said it had commissioned an environmental institute to verify that the particles are safe for thousands of organisms, including mussels and oysters. Any materials in future particles, Gigablue said, will be approved by local authorities.",
      "Shaashua has said the particles are so benign that they have zero impact on the ocean.",
      "\u201cWe are not changing the water chemistry or the water biology,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "Ken Buesseler, a senior scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent decades studying the biological carbon cycle of the ocean, says that while he\u2019s intrigued by Gigablue\u2019s proposal, the idea that the particles don\u2019t alter the ocean is \u201calmost inconceivable.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere has to be a relationship between what they\u2019re putting in the ocean and the carbon dioxide that\u2019s dissolved in seawater for this to, quote, work,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Buesseler co-leads a nonprofit group of scientists hoping to tap the power of algae in the ocean to capture carbon. The group organizes regular forums on the subject, and Gigablue presented in April.",
      "\u201cI left with more questions than answers,\u201d Buesseler said.",
      "Several scientists not affiliated with Gigablue interviewed by The Associated Press said they were interested in how a company with so little public information about its technology could secure a deal for 200,000 carbon credits.",
      "The success of the company\u2019s method, they said, will depend on how much algae grows on the particles, and the amount that sinks to the deep ocean. So far, Gigablue has not released any studies demonstrating those rates.",
      "Thomas Ki\u00f8rboe, a professor of ocean ecology at the Technical University of Denmark, and Philip Boyd, an oceanographer at the University of Tasmania who studies the role of algae in the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle, said they were doubtful algae would get enough sunlight to grow inside the particles.",
      "It\u2019s more likely the particles would attract hungry bacteria, Ki\u00f8rboe said.",
      "\u201cTypical phytoplankton do not grow on surfaces, and they do not colonize particles,\u201d Ki\u00f8rboe said. \u201cTo most phytoplankton ecologists, this would just be, I think, absurd.\u201d",
      "The rates at which Gigablue says its particles sink \u2014 up to a hundred meters (yards) per hour \u2014 might shear off algae from the particles in the quick descent, Boyd said.",
      "It\u2019s likely that some particles would also be eaten by fish \u2014 limiting the carbon capture, and raising the question of how the particles could impact marine life.",
      "Boyd is eager to see field results showing algae growth, and wants to see proof that Gigablue\u2019s particles cause the ocean to absorb more CO2 from the air.",
      "\u201cThese are incredibly challenging issues that I don\u2019t think, certainly for the biological part, I don\u2019t think anyone on the planet has got solutions for them,\u201d he said.",
      "James Kerry, a senior marine and climate scientist for the conservation group OceanCare and senior research fellow at Australia's James Cook University, has closely followed Gigablue\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve got is a situation of a company, a startup, upfront selling large quantities of credits for a technology that is unproven,\u201d he said.",
      "In a statement, Gigablue said that bacteria does consume the particles but the effect is minimal, and its measurements will account for any loss of algae or particles as they sink.",
      "The company noted that a major science institute in New Zealand has given Gigablue its stamp of approval. Gigablue hired the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, a government-owned company, to review several drafts of its methodology.",
      "In a recent letter posted to Gigablue\u2019s website, the institute\u2019s chief ocean scientist said his staff had confidence the company\u2019s work is \u201cscientifically sound\u201d and the proposed measurements for carbon sequestration were robust.",
      "Whether Gigablue\u2019s methods are deemed successful, for now, will be determined not by regulators \u2014 but by another private company.",
      "Puro.earth is one of several companies known as registries that serve the carbon credit market.",
      "Amid the lack of regulation and the potential for climate startups to overstate their impact, registries aim to verify how much carbon was really removed.",
      "The Finnish Puro.earth has verified more than a million carbon credits since its founding seven years ago. But most of those credits originated in land-based climate projects. Only recently has it aimed to set standards for the ocean.",
      "In part, that\u2019s because marine carbon credits are some of the newest to be traded. Dozens of ocean startups have entered the industry, with credit sales catapulting from 2,000 in 2021 to more than 340,000, including Gigablue\u2019s deal, last year.",
      "But the ocean remains a hostile and expensive place in which to operate a business or monitor research. Some ocean startups have sold credits only to fold before they could complete their work. Running Tide, a Maine-based startup aimed at removing carbon from the atmosphere by sinking wood chips and seaweed, abruptly shuttered last year despite the backing of $50 million from investors, leaving sales of about 7,000 carbon credits unfulfilled.",
      "In June, Puro.earth published a draft methodology that will be used to verify Gigablue\u2019s work, which it designed in consultation with Gigablue. Once finalized, Gigablue will pay the registry for each metric ton of carbon dioxide that it claims to remove.",
      "Marianne Tikkanen, head of standards at Puro.earth, said that although this methodology was designed with Gigablue, her team expects other startups to adopt the same approach.",
      "\u201cWe hope that there will be many who can do it and that it stimulates the market,\u201d she said.",
      "It remains to be seen whether New Zealand officials will grant permission for the expanded \u201csequestration field\u201d that Gigablue has proposed creating, or if the company will look to other countries.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s environmental authority has so far treated Gigablue\u2019s work as research \u2014 a designation that requires no formal review process or consultations with the public. The agency said in a statement that it could not comment on how it would handle a future commercial application from Gigablue.",
      "But like many climate startups, Gigablue was involved in selling carbon credits during its research expeditions \u2014 not only inking a major deal, but smaller agreements, too.",
      "Pallas, the Italian businessman, said he ordered 22 carbon credits from Gigablue last year to offset the emissions associated with his event in November. He said Gigablue gave them to him for free \u2014 but says he will pay for more in the future.",
      "Pallas sought out carbon credits because he sees the signs of climate change all around him, he says, and expects more requirements in Italy for businesses to decarbonize in coming years. He chose Gigablue because they are one of the largest suppliers: \u201cThey\u2019ve got quantity,\u201d he said.",
      "How authorities view Gigablue\u2019s growing commercial activity could matter in the context of an international treaty that has banned certain climate operations in the ocean.",
      "More than a decade ago, dozens of countries including New Zealand agreed they should not allow any commercial climate endeavor that involves releasing iron in the ocean, a technique known as \u201ciron fertilization.\u201d Only research, they said, with no prospect of economic gain should be allowed.",
      "Iron is considered a key ingredient for spurring algae growth and was embedded in the particles that Gigablue dispersed in October in the Pacific Ocean. Several scientific papers have raised concerns that spurring iron-fueled algae blooms on a large scale would deplete important nutrients in the ocean and harm fisheries.",
      "The startup denies any link to iron dumping on the basis that its particles don\u2019t release iron directly into the water and don\u2019t create an uncontrolled algae bloom.",
      "\u201cWe are not fertilizing the ocean,\u201d Markus-Alford said.",
      "\u201cIn fact, we looked at iron fertilization as an inspiration of something to avoid,\u201d Shaashua said.",
      "But the draft methodology that Puro.earth will use to verify Gigablue\u2019s work notes many of the same concerns that have been raised about iron fertilization, including disruptions to the marine food web.",
      "Other scientists who spoke with AP see a clear link between Gigablue\u2019s work and the controversial practice. \u201cIf they\u2019re using iron to stimulate phytoplankton growth,\u201d said Kerry, the OceanCare scientist, \u201cthen it is iron fertilization.\u201d",
      "For now, scientific concerns don\u2019t seem to have troubled Gigablue\u2019s buyers. The company has already planned its next research expedition in New Zealand and hopes to release more particles this fall.",
      "\u201cThey mean well, and so do I,\u201d said Pallas, of his support for Gigablue. \u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll catch a plane, go to New Zealand, and grab a boat to see what they\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "The harmless object is currently near Jupiter hundreds of millions of miles (kilometers) away and moving toward Mars, but it should get no closer to the sun than that, according to scientists.",
      "It's too soon to know whether the object, designated for now as A11pl3Z, is a rocky asteroid or a icy comet, or how big and what shape it is. More observations are needed to confirm its origins. NASA said it is monitoring the situation.",

      "ATLANTA -- The nonprofit that operates Shriners Children's hospitals across North America will locate a $153 million medical research facility in Atlanta, the group announced Wednesday.",
      "Shriners Children\u2019s Research Institute intends to conduct research into cell and gene therapies, other biotechnology therapies, robotics, artificial intelligence, medical devices and the study of data.",
      "Shriners Children's operates 17 hospitals in the United States and one each in Mexico and Canada, plus clinics. The system is owned by Shriners International, a Masonic order. It specializes in treating children with orthopedic problems, burns, urology disorders and craniofacial conditions including cleft lips and palates. While the organization accepts insurance payments, it says that it treats patients regardless of their ability to pay.",
      "\u201cThis is a decision of the health care system to expand the role we play in pediatric research,\u201d said Mel Bower, a spokesperson for Shriners Children's. He said the institute will be financed using the Shriners Children's resources and should be operating within a year to 18 months.",
      "The institute projects it will have 470 employees, many of them new hires, and Georgia Tech said it will be the largest tenant at Science Square. That is a mixed-use development that Georgia Tech is developing along with the Trammell Crow Co.",
      "Georgia Tech owns the land adjoining its campus near downtown Atlanta, while the company built labs that opened last year. The development aims to emulate Georgia Tech's success in joint developments with technology companies in Atlanta's Midtown neighborhood. That tech sector has been a major driver of growth in Atlanta in recent years, and officials are now trying to bolster growth from biomedical research.",
      "Leanne West, the chief engineer of pediatric technology at Georgia Tech, said the university has already conducted 25 projects with Shriners Children's. She said both Georgia Tech and Emory University will lend research expertise to the institute, and she hopes institute employees can work alongside Georgia Tech researchers.",
      "\u201cThe goal is to really help embed some of their researchers here with Georgia Tech, to walk across campus, to work in the same labs, to have that physical presence together,\u201d West said. \u201cI think we can accomplish great things by doing that.\u201d",
      "The state and local governments are providing incentives to Shriners Children\u2019s, although it is not exactly clear how that would work because nonprofits are generally exempt from income and property taxes. In Georgia, nonprofit organizations do have to pay sales taxes, which means the state could waive such taxes on equipment purchases. Jessica Atwell, a spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Economic Development, said the state won\u2019t release documents until they are finalized.",

      "Four-fifths of the genome showed links to North Africa and the region around Egypt. But a fifth of the genome showed links to the area in the Middle East between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, known as the Fertile Crescent, where Mesopotamian civilization flourished.",

      "The skeleton was found in an Egyptian tomb complex at the archaeological site of Nuwayrat, inside a chamber carved out from a rocky hillside. An analysis of wear and tear on the skeleton \u2014 and the presence of arthritis in specific joints \u2014 indicates the man was likely in his 60s and may have worked as a potter, said co-author and bioarchaeologist Joel Irish of Liverpool John Moores University.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sales of Tesla electric cars fell sharply in the last three months as boycotts over Elon Musk's political views continue to keep buyers away.",
      "The 13% plunge in global sales over a year earlier suggests the damage to Tesla's brand from Musk's embrace of U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right European politicians is much deeper, widespread and lasting than some investors had expected. The figures reported by Tesla on Wednesday also signal that its quarterly earnings report due later this month could disappoint as rival electric-vehicle makers pounce on its weakness and steal market share. v",
      "Sales fell to 384,122 in April through June, down from 443,956 in the same three months last year.",
      "During the latest period, Musk formally left the Trump administration as a cost-cutting czar, and hopes rose that sales would recover. The Tesla CEO himself recently said the company was in the midst of a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in sales, a statement contradicted by the latest figures.",
      "Still, some parts of the report were encouraging. Sales of the Models 3 and Y totaled 373,728, above the estimate of 356,000 from Wall Street analysts. Tesla shares rose 5% on the news.",
      "\u201cThe numbers weren\u2019t as bad as thought with all the analyst forecast cuts we saw over the past week,\u201d said Morningstar's Seth Goldstein, though he added the report overall showed the company faces big challenges. \u201cThe current product lineup is at market saturation and Tesla will need the new affordable vehicle to grow deliveries.\u201d",
      "Musk has promised a cheaper EV model would be coming this year that would boost sales.",
      "It's not clear yet if Musk's latest feud with Trump will help lure back buyers who have been angry at the billionaire's political positions. After Musk once again took to social media to criticize Trump's budget bill, the president threatened Tuesday to use the power of his office to hurt his companies, including Tesla, pushing its stock down more than 5%.",
      "A June AP-NORC poll showed about half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans.",
      "The new figures come as Tesla is focusing less on new models and more on robots, self-driving technology and robotaxis ferrying passengers around without anyone behind the wheel.",
      "Tesla is in the midst of a test run of robotaxis in Austin, Texas, that seems to have gone smoothly for the most part. But it also has drawn the scrutiny of federal car safety regulators because of a few mishaps, including one case in which a Tesla cab was shown on a video heading down an opposing lane.",
      "The competition from rival EV makers is especially fierce in Europe where China's BYD has taken a bite out of its market share. Tesla sales fell 28% in May in 30 European countries even as the overall market for electric vehicles expanded sharply, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers\u2019 Association.",
      "Musk has acknowledged that his work as head of the Department of Government Efficiency and his embrace of European far-right candidates have hurt the company. But he said earlier this year that much of the sales plunge is due to customers holding off while they waited for an ugrade to Tesla's best selling Model Y. That new version has been out for months now.",

Cooper rejected AT&T\u2019s wager on the car phone, betting that America wanted to feel like Dick Tracy, armed with \u201ca device that was an extension of you, that made you reachable everywhere.\u201d",
      "Fifty-two years ago, Cooper declared victory in a call from a Manhattan sidewalk to the head of AT&T\u2019s rival program. His four-pound DynaTAC 8000X has evolved into a global population of billions of smartphones weighing mere ounces apiece. Some 4.6 billion people \u2014 nearly 60% of the world \u2014 have mobile internet, according to a global association of mobile network operators.",
      "The tiny computers that we carry by the billions are becoming massive, interlinked networks of processors that perform trillions of calculations per second \u2013 the computing power that artificial intelligence needs.

      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and drop them from airplanes over Mexico and even southern Texas",
      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exceptionally good technology,\u201d said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \u201cIt\u2019s an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\u201d",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of the New World Screwworm fly. The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them \u2014 so they can mate ineffectively with females and over time cause the population to die out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\u201cA thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\u201d said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\u201cIt smelled nasty,\u201d he said. \u201cLike rotting meat.\u201d",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly\u2019s cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University\u2019s Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico\u2019s border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \u201cWhiz Packer.\u201d",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA\u2019s \u201ccrowning achievements.\u201d",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn\u2019t be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\u201cSomething we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\u201d Burgess said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A proposal to deter states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade was soundly defeated in the U.S. Senate on Tuesday, thwarting attempts to insert the measure into President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill of tax breaks and spending cuts.",
      "The Senate voted 99-1 to strike the AI provision from the legislation after weeks of criticism from both Republican and Democratic governors and state officials.",
      "Originally proposed as a 10-year ban on states doing anything to regulate AI, lawmakers later tied it to federal funding so that only states that backed off on AI regulations would be able to get subsidies for broadband internet or AI infrastructure.",
      "A last-ditch Republican effort to save the provision would have reduced the time frame to five years and sought to exempt some favored AI laws, such as those protecting children or country music performers from harmful AI tools.",
      "But that effort was abandoned when Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Tuesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.",
      "Proponents of an AI moratorium had argued that a patchwork of state and local AI laws is hindering progress in the AI industry and the ability of U.S. firms to compete with China.",
      "Some prominent tech leaders welcomed the idea after Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who leads the Senate Commerce committee, floated it at a hearing in May.",
      "But state and local lawmakers and AI safety advocates argued that the rule is a gift to an industry that wants to avoid accountability for its products. Led by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a majority of GOP governors sent a letter to Congress opposing it.",
      "Also appealing to lawmakers to strike the provision was a group of parents of children who have died as a result of online harms.",

      "\"Unfortunately, in the wake of this once in a generation natural disaster, we have seen many falsehoods pushed by Democrats such as Senator Chuck Schumer and some members of the media,\" Leavitt said. \"Blaming President Trump for these floods is a depraved lie, and it serves no purpose during this time of national mourning.\"",
      "Schumer, the Senate's top Democrat, on Monday called for an investigation into whether cuts made to NWS in the administration had any correlation to the level of devastation.",
      "\"Following the disastrous and deeply devastating flash flooding in Texas this weekend, I write to urge you to immediately to open an investigation into the scope, breadth, and ramifications of whether staffing shortages at key local National Weather Service (NWS) stations contributed to the catastrophic loss of life and property during the deadly flooding,\" Schumer wrote in a letter sent to Commerce Department Acting Inspector General Roderick Anderson.",
      "At least 94 people, including more than two dozen children, are dead after heavy rain led to flash flooding in Texas.",

      "In a statement to ABC News, the NWS highlighted that they gave briefings to emergency management the day before the tragic event and mentioned some alert lead times.",
      "\u201cThe National Weather Service is heartbroken by the tragic loss of life in Kerr County. On July 3, the NWS office in Austin/San Antonio, TX conducted forecast briefings for emergency management in the morning and issued a Flood Watch in the early afternoon. Flash Flood Warnings were issued on the night of July 3 and in the early morning of July 4, giving preliminary lead times of more than three hours before warning criteria were met. The National Weather Service remains committed to our mission to serve the American public through our forecasts and decision support services,\" the NWS said.",
      "Leavitt, from the podium on Monday, ran through the specific timeline of alerts sent by the NWS and emphasized the extra staff in place at the NWS Austin/San Antonio office.",
      "She noted the office issued a flood watch at 1:18 p.m. on Thursday, July 3. Then, a flash flood warning was issued for Bandera and Kerr counties at 1:14 a.m. on Friday, July 4 that was upgraded with more serious warnings at 3:35 a.m..",
      "\"So, to any person who has deliberately lied about these facts surrounding this catastrophic event, you should be deeply ashamed,\" she said.",
      "Leavitt was asked on Monday why the warnings were sent at a time when people were likely asleep and what, if anything, the administration is doing to ensure that these alerts come out sooner in the future.",
      "\"This was an act of God, it is not the administration's fault that the flood hit when it did but there were early and consistent warnings,\" Leavitt said. \"And again, the National Weather Service did its job.\"",
      "Cruz, at the local news conference in Texas, pushed back on NWS claims but said there would be a \"period of retrospection\" after the immediate recovery efforts to analyze what happened and what went wrong.",
      "\"In the wake of every tragedy, there are things that are predictable,\" Cruz said. \"One of the things that's predictable is to see some people engaging in, I think, partisan games, and trying to blame their political opponents for a natural disaster. And you see that with a hurricane, with a tornado, with a wildfire, with this flooding, where people immediately say, 'Well, the hurricane is Donald Trump's fault.' I think most normal Americans know that's ridiculous, and I think this is not a time for partisan finger pointing and attacks.\"",
      "\"Now, after we come through search and rescue, after we come through the process of rebuilding, there will naturally be a period of retrospection where you look back and say, 'Okay, what exactly transpired, what was the timeline, and what could have been done differently to prevent this loss of life?' And that's a natural process,\" Cruz added. \"I think it should not happen in a bitter and partisan sense, but it should happen in a reasonable sense of saying, what lessons can we learn?\"",
      "President Trump is still planning on visiting Texas on Friday, the White House said, though plans are not yet finalized.",
      "Trump was asked about NWS on Sunday if he was going to investigate whether cuts at NWS left key positions vacant.",
      "\"No, no. They didn't,\" Trump said.",

      "A new study shows that the health of U.S. children has deteriorated over the past 17 years, with kids today more likely to experience obesity, chronic diseases and other problems",
      "The health of U.S. children has deteriorated over the past 17 years, with kids today more likely to have obesity, chronic diseases and mental health problems like depression, a new study says.",
      "Much of what researchers found was already known, but the study paints a comprehensive picture by examining various aspects of children\u2019s physical and mental health at the same time.",
      "\u201cThe surprising part of the study wasn\u2019t any with any single statistic; it was that there\u2019s 170 indicators, eight data sources, all showing the same thing: a generalized decline in kids\u2019 health,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Forrest, one of the authors of the study published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has brought children's health to the forefront of the national policy conversation, unveiling in May a much-anticipated \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d report that described kids as undernourished and overmedicated, and raised concerns about their lack of physical activity. But the Trump administration's actions \u2014 including cuts to federal health agencies, Medicaid and scientific research \u2014 are not likely to reverse the trend, according to outside experts who reviewed Monday\u2019s study.",
      "\u201cThe health of kids in America is not as good as it should be, not as good as the other countries, and the current policies of this administration are definitely going to make it worse,\u201d said Dr. Frederick Rivara, a pediatrician and researcher at the Seattle Children's Hospital and UW Medicine in Seattle. He co-authored an editorial accompanying the new study.",
      "Forrest and his colleagues analyzed surveys, electronic health records from 10 pediatric health systems and international mortality statistics. Among their findings:",
      "\u2014 Obesity rates for U.S. children 2-19 years old rose from 17% in 2007-2008 to about 21% in 2021-2023.",
      "\u2014 A U.S. child in 2023 was 15% to 20% more likely than a U.S. child in 2011 to have a chronic condition such as anxiety, depression or sleep apnea, according to data reported by parents and doctors.",
      "\u2014 Annual prevalence rates for 97 chronic conditions recorded by doctors rose from about 40% in 2011 to about 46% in 2023.",
      "\u2014 Early onset of menstruation, trouble sleeping, limitations in activity, physical symptoms, depressive symptoms and loneliness also increased among American kids during the study period.",
      "\u2014 American children were around 1.8 times more likely to die than kids in other high-income countries from 2007-2022. Being born premature and sudden unexpected death were much higher among U.S. infants, and firearm-related incidents and motor vehicle crashes were much more common among 1-19-year-old American kids than among those the same age in other countries examined.",
      "The research points to bigger problems with America\u2019s health, said Forrest, who is a pediatrician at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cKids are the canaries in the coal mine,\u201d he said. \u201c When kids\u2019 health changes, it\u2019s because they\u2019re at increased vulnerability, and it reflects what\u2019s happening in society at large.\u201d",
      "The timing of the study, he said, is \u201ccompletely fortuitous.\" Well before the 2024 presidential election, Forrest was working on a book about thriving over the life span and couldn\u2019t find this sort of comprehensive data on children\u2019s health.",
      "The datasets analyzed have some limitations and may not be applicable to the full U.S. population, noted Dr. James Perrin, a pediatrician and spokesman for the American Academy of Pediatrics, who wasn't involved in the study.",
      "\u201cThe basic finding is true,\u201d he said.",
      "The editorial published alongside the study said while the administration's MAHA movement is bringing welcome attention to chronic diseases, \"it is pursuing other policies that will work against the interests of children.\u201d Those include eliminating injury prevention and maternal health programs, canceling investments in a campaign addressing sudden infant death and \u201cfueling vaccine hesitancy among parents that may lead to a resurgence of deadly vaccine-preventable diseases,\" authors wrote.",
      "Officials from the U.S. Health and Human Services Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Forrest said risks highlighted by the MAHA report, such as eating too much ultra-processed food, are real but miss the complex reality driving trends in children's health.",
      "\u201cWe have to step back and take some lessons from the ecological sustainability community and say: Let\u2019s look at the ecosystem that kids are growing up in. And let\u2019s start on a kind of neighborhood-by-neighborhood, city-by-city basis, examining it,\u201d he said.",

      "Hua Jiang said he put in an order at the Shake Shack around 8:45 p.m. Sunday and about 10 minutes later, water started flowing through the doors. People started panicking and after about five minutes employees said they should make a run for it, he said. Jiang\u2019s Toyota RAV4 was already flooded in the parking lot, so he went to a Chipotle that was on higher ground.",

      "The Haw River crested early Monday at 32.5 feet (9.91 meters), the second highest river stage ever recorded at the Town of Haw River. That level was only eclipsed by Hurricane Fran in 1996 when the stage reached 32.83 feet (10.01 meters), according to a post from the National Weather Service\u2019s Raleigh office.",
      "More than 30,000 customers were without power on Monday morning, according to poweroutage.us.",

Plaintiffs want U.S. District Judge William Young to rule the policy violates the First Amendment and the Administrative Procedure Act, a law governs the process by which federal agencies develop and issue regulations.",

      "Five Democrats and three Republicans are running in a July 15 primary election in southern Arizona to succeed the late Democratic Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva",
      "PHOENIX -- For over two decades, much of southern Arizona was represented in Congress by Democratic Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a champion of environmental, immigrant and Native American causes who cast a large shadow in progressive politics.",
      "He staked out principled but often futile positions, led an influential bloc of progressive elected officials and breezed past Republican challengers in a career that ended with his death in March at age 77.",
      "His daughter is now among a handful of Democrats seeking to fill his shoes in the 7th Congressional District, while a trio of Republicans is vying for the GOP bid in the July 15 primary. Whoever wins will face off in the Sept. 23 general election.",
      "Six of Arizona's nine U.S. House members are Republican. But the 7th District is a Democratic stronghold, so much so that national Republicans don't talk about picking it up, said pollster Mike O'Neil. It stretches across most of the state's border with Mexico and includes parts of Tucson and nearby counties.",
      "Still, the GOP candidates are holding out hope for change for the first time in 22 years.",
      "Here's a look at the candidates:",
      "Adelita Grijalva, who served on local governing boards, is regarded as the frontrunner. The Democratic candidates also include former state lawmaker Daniel Hernandez, who is credited with helping save then-U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords' life when she was shot outside a Tucson grocery store in 2011.",
      "Digital strategist and reproductive rights advocate Deja Foxx, Indigenous activist and scholar Jose Malvido Jr. and retired health care executive Patrick Harris Sr. round out the field.",
      "All but one of the Democrats \u2014 Hernandez \u2014 said they oppose a massive copper mining project in the district that environmentalists and Native American tribes say will decimate the landscape and destroy sacred sites. Hernandez said environmental protection and job creation can happen simultaneously.",
      "The Democrats' policy stances otherwise are similar in denouncing President Donald Trump's immigration crackdowns as cruel. Cuts to Medicaid and Medicare will hurt residents and rural hospitals, they say.",
      "Adelita Grijalva, whose values she says align with her father's, pushed back against notions she's an establishment candidate.",
      "\u201cIn more than two decades of public service to Arizona, I have a record of my own,\u201d Grijalva said.",
      "Hernandez, a former congressional candidate in a neighboring district, touted his advocacy for gun violence survivors and transgender rights. He said he's not worried about the GOP flipping the 7th District because of its working class and Latino electorate.",
      "Foxx, who at 25 is the youngest Democratic candidate, has shared that her life story includes government housing, subsidized health care and food assistance while being raised by a single mother in Tucson.",
      "She led influencer strategy for Kamala Harris\u2019 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cYou can expect me to be outspoken, to be an obstructionist to Donald Trump\u201d if elected, she said.",
      "Malvido has spoken out against the killings of Palestinians in the Israel-Hamas war, believes the United States needs to preserve the separation of powers and wants to reconnect with working class voters.",
      "Patrick Harris has proposed setting a national wealth threshold of $1 billion and taxing the excess if it's not reinvested or donated within a year to keep the American dream within reach.",
      "The Republicans in the running generally favor Trump's immigration crackdown, though painting company owner Daniel Butierez objected to enforcement around schools and churches. Off-road vehicle businessman Jimmy Rodriguez says he's open to immigrants filling jobs in the farming and construction industries, as long as they're not convicted criminals.",
      "Butierez and restaurant owner Jorge Rivas support Trump's bill of tax breaks and funding cuts but share concerns with Democrats about losing health care funding.",
      "Butierez's path to political life has been unconventional. He was imprisoned in a drug case but was found to have been wrongly convicted. He credited religion for turning his life around and said his experiences in life and his business sense make him suited to serve in Congress.",
      "\u201cI believe there's going to be a shift,\u201d said Butierez, who captured 36% of the vote in the 2024 election against Ra\u00fal Grijalva. \u201cI actually believe it's going to be a complete upset.\u201d",
      "Rivas immigrated to the United States when his native El Salvador was embroiled in a civil war in the 1980s. He started serving meals from a food wagon and now operates a Mexican restaurant as a U.S. citizen. He said his success came from hard work and a little luck.",
      "\u201cI know how bad things can get when you don't have the right people in power,\u201d he said.",
      "Rodriguez, who ran for Congress in Vermont in 2020, said he was inspired to seek public office after enduring hardships following the loss of his 19-year-old son who was hit while photographing an off-road race in Nevada.",
      "Three years later, he pleaded guilty to making a false statement to a government agency and was sentenced to five years of probation in Arizona. He said he's owned the mistake and is making amends.",
      "\u201cI really want to be the representative that I needed back when I went through all this with my son, and I think I\u2019m capable,\" he said.",

      "Despite an absence of warning by local authorities, camp officials acted quickly on their own, relocating about 70 children and adults staying overnight in a building near the river. With the kids safe, camp leaders including President and CEO Tim Huchton were able to avoid the catastrophe that hit at least one other camp near Hunt, where the 500-acre Mo-Ranch is located.",
      "\u201cThey helped them pack up,\u201d Lisa Winters, communications director for Mo-Ranch, told The Associated Press on Sunday. \u201cThey got them up, they got them out, put them up on higher ground.\u201d",

As of Sunday, 10 girls from nearby Camp Mystic remained missing, officials said. Rescue and recovery teams combed the area for them and others still unaccounted for days after the flood.",
      "The decision to leave added to the mounting accounts of how camps and residents in the area say they were left to make their own decisions in the absence of warnings or notifications from the county.",
      "Local authorities have faced heavy scrutiny and at times have deflected questions about how much warning they had or were able to provide the public, saying the reviews will come later. For now, they say they're focusing on rescues. Officials have said they did not expect such an intense downpour, the equivalent of months\u2019 worth of rain for the area.",

      "\u201cWe had no warning this was coming,\" Winters said, adding that it would have been \u201cdevastating\u201d had camp officials not been looking at weather reports and the rising river waters.",
      "Mo-Ranch \u201csaw it coming well in advance and they did something about it,\u201d she said.",
      "By about 7 a.m. Friday, camp staff began contacting children's parents, telling them their kids were safe.",
      "\u201cThey knew that those parents would wake up and just see all this media footage of kids lost, or the river,\u201d Winters said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018tell your parents you\u2019re OK\u2019 \u2026 We made sure every single guest, every single kid, was accounted for.\u201d",
      "The camp, which sits on higher ground than some in the area, suffered some damage, but not as significant as others, Winters said.",
      "\u201cThe buildings don\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine losing children, or people.\u201d",

      "That furthers the uncertainty for businesses, consumers and America's trading partners, and questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether President Donald Trump will once more push off imposing the rates. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations.",

A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect. The negotiating window until July 9 has led to announced deals only with the United Kingdom and Vietnam.",
      "Trump imposed elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the U.S., and a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency. There are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on autos.",
      "Since April, few foreign governments have set new trade terms with Washington as the Republican president demanded.",

The devastation along the Guadalupe River, outside of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. Friday's flash floods started with a particularly bad storm that dropped most of its 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain in the dark early morning hours.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area say water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet (8 meters) in just 45 minutes.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday that there were 41 people confirmed to be unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, searchers have found the bodies of 68 people, including 28 children, Sheriff Larry Leitha said Sunday afternoon. Fatalities in nearby counties brought the total number of deaths to 79 as of Sunday evening.",
      "Ten girls and a counselor were still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river.",

      "And records behind those statistics don\u2019t always account for human-caused climate change. Though it\u2019s hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kerr county officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost.",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It\u2019s going to be a long time before we\u2019re ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",

      "\u201cWhen there is a disaster or storm, sirens, things like that, a natural fear response is for them \u2026 to hide and to run away. So, you know, making sure that your yard is secure and that they\u2019re in a quiet, safe, secure place can help avoid that,\u201d she said.",
      "Animal rescue groups say it\u2019s important to have your pet crate trained so their crate can be used as a safe space for your pets.",
      "People who decide to stay and ride out a storm should keep their pets close, Perea said. Leaving them alone in another room \u201cis just going to elevate their stress,\u201d he added.",
      "Leaving pets behind, particularly if they're left tied to a fence or chained in a backyard, can be deadly.",
      "\u201cIf the disaster comes along, they can\u2019t move away from it,\u201d Perea said. \u201cThe disaster rolls through and they suffer a horrific death potentially.\u201d",
      "Abandoning your pets could also result in animal cruelty charges.",
      "The plight of a bull terrier named Trooper, who was rescued last year during Hurricane Milton after being found chained to a fence along a Tampa highway, inspired a new Florida law that imposes tougher penalties on people who abandon pets during natural disasters.",
      "Most emergency operations centers during a natural disaster focus part of their work on animal rescues, Perea said.",
      "But both Perea and Kuenstle said most pets and other animals needing rescue are not abandoned on purpose.",
      "During Hurricane Harvey in Houston in 2017, Kuenstle's group rescued about 2,300 animals, including cats, dogs and horses, reuniting about 300 of them with their humans.",
      "\u201cA lot of it was ... \u2019We had no idea we wouldn\u2019t be able to come back.\u2019 They were contacting us in a panic. They were concerned about their pet,\u201d Kuenstle said.",
      "The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005 is filled with countless stories of residents not wanting to leave their flooded homes if they couldn\u2019t bring their furry loved ones, Perea said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Eight men deported from the United States in May and held under guard for weeks at an American military base in the African nation of Djibouti while their legal challenges played out in court have now reached the Trump administration's intended destination, war-torn South Sudan, a country the State Department advises against travel to due to \u201ccrime, kidnapping, and armed conflict.\u201d",
      "The immigrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and South Sudan arrived in South Sudan on Friday after a federal judge cleared the way for the Trump administration to relocate them in a case that had gone to the Supreme Court, which had permitted their removal from the U.S. Administration officials said the men had been convicted of violent crimes in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis was a win for the rule of law, safety and security of the American people,\u201d said Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin in a statement Saturday announcing the men's arrival in South Sudan, a chaotic country in danger once more of collapsing into civil war.",
      "The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the transfer of the men who had been put on a flight in May bound for South Sudan. That meant that the South Sudan transfer could be completed after the flight was detoured to a base in Djibouti, where they men were held in a converted shipping container. The flight was detoured after a federal judge found the administration had violated his order by failing to allow the men a chance to challenge the removal.",
      "The court\u2019s conservative majority had ruled in June that immigration officials could quickly deport people to third countries. The majority halted an order that had allowed immigrants to challenge any removals to countries outside their homeland where they could be in danger.",
      "A flurry of court hearings on Independence Day resulted a temporary hold on the deportations while a judge evaluated a last-ditch appeal by the men's before the judge decided he was powerless to halt their removals and that the person best positioned to rule on the request was a Boston judge whose rulings led to the initial halt of the administration\u2019s effort to begin deportations to South Sudan.",
      "By Friday evening, that judge had issued a brief ruling concluding the Supreme Court had tied his hands.",
      "The men had final orders of removal, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have said. Authorities have reached agreements with other countries to house immigrants if authorities cannot quickly send them back to their homelands.",

      "Meteorologists say incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods",
      "WASHINGTON -- Incredible amounts of moisture in the air fueled a storm that moved slowly and dumped rain over central Texas, creating conditions for fatal flash floods in the early morning hours when it was easy to catch people by surprise, meteorologists said.",
      "More than 12 inches (30 centimeters) of rain fell in the Texas Hill Country over a span of several hours early Friday, causing water levels to quickly rise, according to the weather forecasting company AccuWeather. The area is naturally prone to flash flooding, but this was an especially bad storm that hit during the vulnerable overnight hours, experts said. Dozens of deaths have been reported along with numerous rescues.",
      "Meteorologists said that an atmosphere warmed by human-caused climate change can hold more moisture and allow bad storms to dump more rain, though it\u2019s hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur.",
      "\u201cIn a warming climate we know that the atmosphere has more moisture to give, to hold on to and then to release. But also the thing that we know about climate change is that our rain events are not as uniform as what they used to be,\u201d said Shel Winkley, a meteorologist with Climate Central. \u201cSo, you\u2019ll get these big rain events happening in localized areas, tapping into the historic level of moisture in the atmosphere.\u201d",
      "In recent weeks, flash flooding driven by bursts of heavy rain turned deadly elsewhere in Texas and in West Virginia. In San Antonio in June, more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain fell over a span of hours, prompting dozens of rescues from the fast-rising floodwaters and killing at least 13. And in West Virginia that month, at least nine people died when as much as 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain fell within 40 minutes and caused flash flooding in the Wheeling area.",
      "Robert Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said this latest Texas rain storm was roughly a once-in-a-generation event. It fell in the Texas Hill Country where water quickly shoots down rugged hills into narrow river basins that swell quickly.",
      "\u201cAs is often the case with the worst disasters, many things came together in a terrible way.\u201d Henson said.",
      "Plus, the area had been in a drought, so the water ran down the dry, hard land fast. That made it more dangerous for children attending camp.",
      "\u201cA sudden surge of rain like that is going to have a harder time getting absorbed,\u201d said Brett Anderson, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. \u201cIt just runs right off of it. It\u2019s like concrete.\u201d",
      "The sheer amount of rain was overwhelming. Former NOAA chief scientist Ryan Maue, a private meteorologist, calculated Saturday morning that the storm had dropped 120 billion gallons of water on Kerr County, which received the brunt of the storm.",
      "Moisture fueled the storm from many directions. Tropical Storm Barry formed briefly last weekend, moving over Mexico and then its remnants continued up into Texas. But the jet stream, a current of air that moves weather patterns, wasn\u2019t there to push that moisture away.",
      "\u201cNormally weather systems and the remnants of tropical systems will get picked up by the jet stream, and that\u2019s just not over Texas currently,\u201d said Winkley, the Climate Central meteorologist. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially a weather system without a road to get away from the Lone Star State.\u201d",
      "The warm water of the Gulf fueled the moist atmosphere. Even more moisture came from areas over the Pacific Ocean to the west. The combination gave the storm plenty of fuel once it got started.",
      "Winkley said in the area that flooded, climate change might mean that rain storms are less common, but when they do occur they can be more severe.",
      "Generally a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture, creating conditions for storms to drop more rain.",
      "\u201cWith climate change we have a warming atmosphere. A warmer atmosphere holds a lot more moisture, and we are seeing obviously much more total atmospheric moisture across the globe in recent years than we normally have,\u201d said Anderson, the AccuWeather meteorologist.",

      "Lester was among the older girls housed on elevated ground known as Senior Hill. Cabins housing the younger campers, who can start attending at age 8, are situated along the riverbanks and were the first to flood, she said.",
      "\u201cThe camp was completely destroyed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really scary.\u201d",
      "Her mother, Elizabeth Lester, said her son was nearby at Camp La Junta and also escaped. A counselor there woke up to find water rising in the cabin, opened a window and helped the boys swim out. Camp La Junta and nearby Camp Waldemar said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff were safe.",
      "Elizabeth Lester sobbed when she saw her daughter, who was clutching a small teddy bear and a book.",
      "\u201cMy kids are safe, but knowing others are still missing is just eating me alive,\" she said.",
      "Dozens of families shared in local Facebook groups that they received devastating phone calls from safety officials informing them that their daughters had not yet been located among the washed-away camp cabins and downed trees. Camp Mystic said in an email to parents of the roughly 750 campers that if they have not been contacted directly, their child is accounted for.",
      "Camp Mystic sits on a strip known to locals as \u201cflash flood alley.\"",
      "\u201cWhen it rains, water doesn\u2019t soak into the soil,\u201d said Austin Dickson, CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, which was collecting donations. \u201cIt rushes down the hill.\u201d",
      "Decades prior, floodwaters engulfed a bus of teenage campers from another Christian camp along the Guadalupe River during devastating summer storms in 1987. A total of 10 campers from Pot O\u2019 Gold Christian camp drowned after their bus was unable to evacuate in time from a site near Comfort, 33 miles (53 kilometers) east of Hunt.",
      "Chloe Crane, a teacher and former Camp Mystic counselor, said her heart broke when a fellow teacher shared an email from the camp about the missing girls.",
      "\u201cTo be quite honest, I cried because Mystic is such a special place, and I just couldn\u2019t imagine the terror that I would feel as a counselor to experience that for myself and for 15 little girls that I\u2019m taking care of,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s also just sadness, like the camp has been there forever and cabins literally got washed away.\u201d",
      "Crane said the camp is a haven for young girls looking to gain confidence and independence. She recalled happy memories teaching her campers about journalism, making crafts and competing in a camp-wide canoe race at the end of each summer. Now for many campers and counselors, their happy place has turned into a horror story, she said.",

      "A federal judge on Friday temporarily halted deportations of eight immigrants to war-torn South Sudan the day after the Supreme Court greenlighted their removal, saying new claims by the immigrants' lawyers deserved a hearing.",
      "District Judge Randolph Moss proceeded with the extraordinary Fourth of July hearing on Friday afternoon, directing the Trump administration to discuss whether a prior Supreme Court ruling that immigrants slated for removal under an 18th century wartime act invoked by President Donald Trump deserve due process might also apply to those due to be removed to South Sudan.",
      "The administration has been trying to deport the immigrants for weeks. None are from South Sudan, which is enmeshed in civil war and where the U.S government advises no one should travel before making their own funeral arrangements. The government flew them to Djibouti but couldn't move them further because a Massachusetts court had ruled no immigrant could be sent to a new country without a chance to have a court hearing.",
      "The Supreme Court vacated that decision last month, then Thursday night issued a new order clarifying that that meant the immigrants could be moved to South Sudan. Lawyers for the immigrants, who hail from Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Vietnam and other countries, filed an emergency request to halt their removal later that night.",
      "The case was assigned to Moss, who issued his order to let the government respond and \u201cto provide time for a hearing.\u201d That hearing was happening Friday afternoon.",
      "The temporary stay was first reported by legal journalist Chris Geidner.",

    "story": [
      "Fireworks are a cornerstone of America's Fourth of July celebrations, but that can make the spirited holiday dangerous",
      "St. Louis -- The Fourth of July is Americana at its core: parades and cookouts and cold beer and, of course, fireworks.",
      "Those pyrotechnics also make it an especially dangerous holiday, typically resulting in more than 10,000 trips to the emergency room. Yet fireworks remain at the center of Independence Day, a holiday 247 years in the making.",
      "Here are five things to know about July Fourth, including the origin of the holiday and how fireworks became part of the tradition.",
      "The holiday celebrates the Second Continental Congress\u2019 unanimous adoption of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, a document announcing the colonies\u2019 separation from Great Britain.",
      "One year later, according to the Library of Congress, a spontaneous celebration in Philadelphia marked the anniversary of American independence.",
      "But across the burgeoning nation, observations didn\u2019t become commonplace until after the War of 1812. It quickly took off: The Library of Congress notes that major historic events in the 19th century, such as groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, were scheduled to coincide with Fourth of July festivities.",
      "The display of pyrotechnics has been a big part of Independence Day from the outset. Founding Father John Adams saw it coming.",
      "Commemoration of America\u2019s independence \u201cought to be solemnized with Pomp and Parade, with Shews, Games, Sports, Guns, Bells, Bonfires and Illuminations from one End of this Continent to the other from this Time forward forever more,\u201d Adams wrote in a letter to his wife, Abigail, dated July 3, 1776.",
      "Fireworks were around centuries before America became a nation. The American Pyrotechnics Association says many historians believe fireworks were first developed in the second century B.C. in ancient China by throwing bamboo stalks into fires, causing explosions as the hollow air pockets overheated.",
      "By the 15th century, fireworks were widely used for religious festivals and public entertainment in Europe and early U.S. settlers carried on those traditions, the association said.",
      "Presidents from George Washington to Donald Trump have celebrated the nation\u2019s birth on the Fourth of July, with one exception: Adams.",
      "His letter to his wife aside, Adams refused to celebrate the holiday on July 4 because he felt July 2 was the real Independence Day. Why? It was on July 2, 1776, that the Continental Congress voted in favor of the resolution for independence, though the Declaration of Independence wasn\u2019t formally adopted until two days later.",
      "Adams was so adamant that he turned down invitations to festivals and other events, even while serving as the nation\u2019s second president. Ironically, Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the primary author of the Declaration of Independence, both died on the 50th anniversary of the document\u2019s formal adoption, July 4, 1826.",
      "Consumer sales of fireworks have grown rapidly over the past two decades.",
      "Statistics from the American Pyrotechnics Association show that in 2000, American consumers spent $407 million on fireworks. By 2024, that figure rose to $2.2 billion. The biggest jump came during the COVID-19 pandemic, when public fireworks displays were shut down. Consumer sales jumped from $1 billion in 2019 to $1.9 billion in 2020.",
      "The cost of fireworks could soar if the trade war between the U.S. and China continues \u2014 most aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that transfix the eyes of Americans every Fourth of July are imported from China. A 90-day pause on Trump's hefty tariffs on Chinese imports brought some temporary relief, but industry experts are uncertain as they watch for an agreement.",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, thousands of Americans are badly injured by fireworks each year.",
      "The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reports that in 2024, 11 deaths were blamed on fireworks, up 38% from 2023. An estimated 1,700 people were treated at emergency rooms for sparkler-related injuries and 14,7000 people were injured from fireworks \u2014 a 52% increase compared to 2023.",
      "Burns were the most common injury. People hurt their hands and fingers most often, and head, face and ear injuries were frequent, too.",
      "For those planning to shoot off fireworks, experts urge finding a flat, hard, level surface away from structures and other things that could catch fire. The person responsible for the fireworks should avoid alcohol. Children should never ignite them.",
      "Experts have also encouraged having a bucket or hose nearby in case of fire or explosion. Shoot off one at a time and walk away quickly after igniting, she said, and never relight or handle a malfunctioned firework. When done, shovel up the remains and soak them before disposing.",

      "Millions of protesters have denounced President Donald Trump as a would-be autocrat and marched under the banner \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- Alarmed by the policies of President Donald Trump, millions turned out last month for protests around the United States and overseas. Mindful of next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of American independence, organizers called the movement \u201cNo Kings.\u201d",
      "Had the same kind of rallies been called for in the summer of 1775, the response likely would have been more cautious.",
      "\u201cIt ('No Kings') was probably a minority opinion in July 1775,\u201d says H.W. Brands, a prize-winning scholar and chair of the history department at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\u201cThere was a lot of passion for revolution in New England, but that was different from the rest of the country,\u201d says Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Joseph Ellis. \u201cThere were still people who don't want to drawn into what they feared was an unnecessary war.\u201d",
      "This month marks the 250th anniversary \u2014 the semiquincentennial \u2014 of a document enacted almost exactly a year before the Declaration of Independence: \u201cThe Olive Branch Petition,\u201d ratified July 5, 1775 by the Continental Congress. Its primary author was John Dickinson, a Pennsylvanian whose writing skills led some to call him the \u201cPenman of the Revolution,\u201d and would stand as a final, desperate plea to reconcile with Britain.",
      "The notion of \u201cNo Kings\u201d is a foundation of democracy. But over the first half of 1775 Dickinson and others still hoped that King George III could be reasoned with and would undo the tax hikes and other alleged abuses they blamed on the British Parliament and other officials. Ellis calls it the \u201cAwkward Interval,\u201d when Americans had fought the British in Lexington and Concord and around Bunker Hill, while holding off from a full separation.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion is changing during this time, but it still would have been premature to issue a declaration of independence,\u201d says Ellis, whose books include \u201cFounding Brothers,\u201d \u201cThe Cause\u201d and the upcoming \u201cThe Great Contradiction.\"",
      "The Continental Congress projected unity in its official statements. But privately, like the colonies overall, members differed. Jack Rakove, a professor of history at Stanford University and author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning \u201cOriginal Meanings,\u201d noted that delegates to Congress ranged from \u201cradicals\u201d such as Samuel Adams who were avid for independence to such \u201cmoderates\u201d as Dickinson and New York's John Jay.",
      "The Olive Branch resolution balanced references to \u201cthe delusive pretences, fruitless terrors, and unavailing severities\u201d administered by British officials with dutiful tributes to shared ties and to the king's \u201croyal magnanimity and benevolence.\u201d",
      "\u201c(N)otwithstanding the sufferings of your loyal Colonists during the course of this present controversy, our Breasts retain too tender a regard for the Kingdom from which we derive our Origin to request such a Reconciliation as might in any manner be inconsistent with her Dignity or her welfare,\u201d the sometimes obsequious petition reads in part.",
      "The American Revolution didn\u2019t arise at a single moment but through years of anguished steps away from the \u201cmother\u201d country \u2014 a kind of weaning that at times suggested a coming of age, a young person\u2019s final departure from home. In letters and diaries written in the months before July 1775, American leaders often referred to themselves as children, the British as parents and the conflict a family argument.",
      "Edmund Pendleton, a Virginia delegate to the Continental Congress, urged \u201ca reconciliation with Our mother Country.\u201d Jay, who would later help negotiate the treaty formally ending the Revolutionary War, proposed informing King George that \u201cyour majesty\u2019s American subjects\u201d are \u201cbound to your majesty by the strongest ties of allegiance and affection and attached to their parent country by every bond that can unite societies.\u201d",
      "In the Olive Branch paper, Dickinson would offer tribute to \u201cthe union between our Mother country and these colonies.\u201d",
      "The Congress, which had been formed the year before, relied in the first half of 1775 on a dual strategy that now might be called \u201cpeace through strength,\u201d a blend of resolve and compromise. John Adams defined it as \u201cto hold the sword in one hand, the olive branch in the other.\u201d Dickinson's petition was a gesture of peace. A companion document, \u201cThe Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms,\" was a statement of resolve.",
      "The 1775 declaration was drafted by Thomas Jefferson, who a year later would be the principal writer of the Declaration of Independence, revised by Dickinson and approved by the Congress on July 6. The language anticipated the Declaration of Independence with its condemnation of the British for \u201ctheir intemperate Rage for unlimited Domination\u201d and its vows to \u201cmake known the Justice of our Cause.\u201d",
      "But while the Declaration of Independence ends with the 13 colonies \u201cabsolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown,\u201d the authors in 1775 assured a nervous public \u201cthat we mean not to dissolve that Union which has so long and so happily subsisted between us, and which we sincerely wish to see restored.\u201d",
      "\u201cNecessity has not yet driven us into that desperate Measure, or induced us to excite any other Nation to war against them,\u201d they wrote.",
      "John Adams and Benjamin Franklin were among the peers of Dickinson who thought him naive about the British, and were unfazed when the king refused even to look at the Olive Branch petition and ruled that the colonies were in a state of rebellion. Around the same time Dickinson was working on his draft, the Continental Congress readied for further conflict. It appointed a commander of the newly-formed Continental Army, a renowned Virginian whom Adams praised as \u201cmodest and virtuous ... amiable, generous and brave.\"",
      "His name: George Washington. His ascension, Adams wrote, \"will have a great effect, in cementing and securing the Union of these Colonies.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",

Set 50 years ago over the July 4th weekend, the plot, says Dreyfuss, is simple: \"This was the story of three guys against this shark. It was this human thing. And we were really good and we knew it. Wow, a kid getting bitten? And if you remember the beginning of the film, you are terrified before you see the shark.\"",
      "Before the shark brought terror to the big screen, it arrived at the bookstore. In 1974, Peter Benchley's novel became a bestseller. Spielberg read it and immediately wanted to direct the movie version \u2013 though he was unhappy with early drafts. So, he asked a friend, screenwriter Carl Gottlieb, to rip it to shreds.",
      "\"Steven sent it to me with a note on the cover that said, 'Eviscerate it!!'\" Gottlieb said.",
      "Gottlieb wrote a lengthy memo, noting, \"If we do our jobs right, people will feel about going in the water the way they felt about taking a shower after 'Psycho.'\"",
      "They did their jobs, all right, led by those three guys: Actor Robert Shaw as Quint, the hunter with a shark-infested backstory; Roy Scheider, the police chief afraid of the water; and Dreyfuss, who changed his mind about making \"Jaws\" after seeing (and hating) his own performance in the film he'd just made, \"The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz.\"",
      "\"I said, 'If I'm not working when this film comes out, I'll never work again,'\" Dreyfuss said. \"And so, I went back to Steven and begged him for the part, and he gave it to me. They had started shooting on April 2; I was cast on the 3rd; my first day of shooting was the 4th; that was the way it all went.\"",
      "Lorraine Gary played Ellen Brody, the police chief's wife. \"I had nothing to lose,\" she said. \"I was getting older. I was 32. That's almost ancient! And it sounded like fun.\"",
      "I asked, \"What about being cast in this sounded like fun to you?\"",
      "\"Going on location to Martha's Vineyard,\" Gary replied. \"I had never been there. Robert Shaw sounded like fun!\"",
      "\"Well, I think I know what that means. But what does that mean?\"",
      "\"You know what it means. And so do you in the audience!\" Gary laughed.",
      "Her experience with Roy Scheider? That was less fun. \"I feel closer to you than I did to the man who played my husband,\" Gary said. \"I think Roy was very protective of his career. I think he was at that point in his career where he hadn't quite made it to being a big-time star. And, perhaps, he thought that I wasn't top drawer enough to be his wife. I never felt a closeness with him. I felt older, and larger. A big head.\"",
      "\"Literally big head?\" I asked.",
      "\"Literally. I mean, he told me, 'Your head is bigger than mine' in the two-shot!\" she laughed.",
      "In addition to writing the script, Gottlieb played newspaperman Harry Meadows. He earned roughly $13,000 for writing and acting in \"Jaws.\" Though he says much of the dark humor was not on the page.",
      "\"We were blessed with a cast that could kind of ad lib in character,\" he said. \"With most actors if you say, 'Ad lib,' it makes their part bigger. But these people were ad libbing relatively selflessly. When I spotted something potentially funny, or if there was humor in something, I would say to Steven, 'I think we got a laugh here if we change the line.'\" And, he said, Spielberg was always responsive to that.",
      "Then there were the delays. As the shooting schedule tripled from 55 days to 159, the actors started to get under each other's skin. Dreyfuss said, \"The thing about Robert Shaw, he knew that he had me psychologically, like, with a little pin through my stomach. And if he said that I couldn't do 25 sit-ups, I couldn't. But I could. And he would say, 'You can't jump off the top of the Orca into the water.' And I couldn't. But I could. He had me!\"",
      "I spoke to Dreyfuss at the Harbor View Hotel, where some of the cast and crew stayed \u2026 and where Oscar-winning editor Verna Fields cut much of the movie. It was also the scene of a \"Jaws\" food fight. Dreyfuss doesn't quite remember who threw the first lobster roll: \"Well, it was either Roy or me.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" surfaced on June 20, 1975. For the first time ever, a movie opened nationwide, and for the first time ever, a movie made more than $100 million.",
      "Asked why it did so well, Gottlieb replied, \"You know, why is the Mona Lisa still a hit? It had that combination of things, any three of which or five of which would've made it a hit. But ['Jaws'] had, like, ten of those.\"",
      "\"Jaws\" changed Hollywood, as well as the lives of everyone associated with it. Steven Spielberg has become the defining director of his generation, and the legacies of Robert Shaw, Roy Scheider and Richard Dreyfuss are forever linked to this film, a movie that millions of us still think about every single time we stroll toward the ocean.",
      "Dreyfuss said, \"I will never walk from the beach into the water so that the water comes up to my chest. If and when that ever happens, I'll either be dead or in a mental institution. The fact that I can't see what's happening underneath is so real to me, I can't do it.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before 'Jaws' and after 'Jaws'?\"",
      "\"Before 'Jaws,\" I didn't care!\" Dreyfuss replied.",

    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 10:18:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer's latest book delves into the life, complexities and sardonic humor of a man who remains a vital presence in American culture.",
    "story": [
      "The Mississippi Valley is \"as tranquil and reposeful as dreamland, and has nothing this-worldly about it \u2026 nothing to hang a fret or worry upon.\" It's a beautiful sentiment, and yet it contrasts with the fretful and worried life of the man who wrote those words: Samuel Clemens, known to the world by his pen name, Mark Twain.",
      "Twain died 115 years ago, but his books are still being read, and hotly debated, around the globe. It's quite the legacy for a mischievous boy of modest means raised in Hannibal, Missouri, just steps away from the roaring Mississippi. It was, said Jim Waddell, \"the international highway of 1835.\"",
      "Waddell has portrayed Twain for three decades \u2013 a performance always in demand when Hannibal's streets are filled each spring for the Twain on Main festival. It's a good gig that requires of Waddell a clean white suit. \"You keep the suit white by doing no work!\" Waddell laughed.",
      "Korbin Asbury and Ainsley Ahrens competed against other eighth graders in the town to represent the characters Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher in Hannibal. \"I love meeting the new people, 'cause there's 44 different countries that visited Hannibal last year,\" said Asbury.",
      "Asked if she were surprised that an author who lived more than 100 years ago still seems so relevant today, Ahrens replied, \"I am, but not really, because his words that he said, they still work with us today. They're wise words.\"",
      "Wise words, with more than a touch of humor:",
      "\"Always do right. This will gratify some people, and astonish the rest.\"",
      "\"Reader, suppose you were an idiot. And suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.\"",
      "Twain is quoted as having called himself not just an American, but \"the American.\" \"I think that part of the continuing fascination with Mark Twain is that he combines in his person both the best and the worst of our national culture,\" said Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow. He has chronicled the lives of great Americans, perhaps most famously Alexander Hamilton, whose biography spawned the Broadway musical. Chernow's latest book tackles the life of Twain, a figure who has never left the national spotlight.",
      "Twain once wrote, \"Biographies are but the clothes and buttons of the man \u2013 the biography of the man himself cannot be written.\" \"That line was in my head every single day that I worked on this book,\" Chernow laughed. \"I kind of had this image of Mark Twain coming back to life and saying, 'I told you so.'\"",
      "Chernow traces Twain's sardonic humor to the pain in which it was rooted. Although he enjoyed boyhood adventures that would inspire \"Tom Sawyer,\" his father was a failure in business.\u00a0 The fear of poverty, and an anxious pursuit of wealth, would dominate Twain's adult life.",
      "In Hartford, Connecticut, site of Twain's home, Chernow described the sprawling mansion that he had built: \"I see his personality. All the angles and porches and turrets, it's like all of the different sides of his personality. And he always loved conspicuousness, and this is probably the most conspicuous house in the city.\"",
      "I asked, \"Was Mark Twain happy here?\"",
      "\"Not just happy here, it was far and away the happiest 17 years of his life,\" Chernow said. \"It was this idyllic period. He had this large expensive house. He had a rich and gorgeous wife. He had three beautiful and smart daughters. It was really a charmed life.\"",
      "Although Twain became wealthy as a writer and public speaker, he poured his fortune \u2013 and his wife's \u2013 into ill-fated investments. The most notorious was the Paige Compositor, a typesetting machine that Twain was sure would make him millions.",
      "The themes that run through Twain's life and his work \u2013 politics, corruption, money, class, race, get-rich-quick themes \u2013 all seem quite relevant to America today. Chernow said, \"It's a great American story, and I think that there's so many things that he said \u2013 for instance, about politics \u2013 that really resonate today. One line that used to drive him crazy was, 'My country right or wrong.' You know, he said that we should support our country always, and our government when it deserves it.\"",
      "Chernow believes President Trump would be a familiar figure to the humorist, \"to the extent that one of the great stock characters in Mark Twain's fiction is the salesman. You can see it in President Trump. You could see it in so many different figures in American life \u2013 the big talkers, the big shots.\"",
      "It's no small irony that Twain was nothing if not a big shot himself \u2013 a man who craved attention as much as money. But fame also emboldened Twain to speak truth to power, most enduringly through his masterpiece, \"Huckleberry Finn.\"",
      "Chernow said, \"One of the things that I argued in my book was that there was no White author in the late 19th century who engaged more fully, and I think more affectionately, with the Black community than Twain. Now, I had to point out early on, if you read letters that he wrote when he was a teenager, they're full of crude, racist remarks \u2013 and not only about Blacks, seems like just about everybody.\"",
      "By 1884, Twain had published \"Huck Finn,\" which, said Chernow, \"whatever its imperfections, is still, I think, the great anti-slavery novel in the language.\"",
      "For Chernow, Mark Twain is still a vital presence in American life. His words continue to make us think, and almost certainly laugh.",
      "Asked why his works have endured when so many other great authors' books are languishing, Chernow replied, \"I think it's a very, very good question. He likened a fine literature to a wine, and he said, 'My writing is water, but everyone drinks water.'\"",
      "And they are still drinking it (and still reading Twain).",

      "And was there brotherly love between the famously feuding Gallagher siblings? Definitely maybe.",
      "Fans traveled to the Welsh capital from around the world for a show that many thought would never happen. Guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher and his singer brother Liam, the heart of Oasis, had not performed together since their acrimonious split in 2009.",
      "One fan banner summed it up: \"The great wait is over.\"",
      "After a montage of headlines about the sparring siblings was capped with the words \"the guns have fallen silent,\" Oasis appeared on stage to a deafening roar, opening with the apt \"Hello\" and its refrain of \"it's good to be back.\"",
      "The brothers had a brief hand-in-hand moment but largely kept their distance onstage. Noel, 58, focused on his guitar while a parka-clad Liam, 52, snarled into the microphone with a swagger that has not dimmed in the 31 years since the band released its first album, \"Definitely Maybe.\"",
      "A crowd of more than 60,000 in the Principality Stadium was treated to a well-paced two-hour set that drew heavily on the first album and its 1995 followup, \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory,\" alongside a smattering of later tracks and fan-favorite B-sides.",
      "Song like \"Supersonic,\" \"Roll With It\" and \"Rock 'n' Roll Star\" sounded as thunderous as ever and sparked mass sing-alongs.",

      "Noel took his turn on lead vocals for several songs, including the touching \"Half the World Away,\" and the show ended with encores featuring some of Oasis' most enduring tracks: \"Don't Look Back in Anger,\" \"Wonderwall\" and \"Champagne Supernova.\" The brothers shared a half-hug as they ended the final song.",
      "Multicolored, sometimes faintly psychedelic projections formed the main technological accoutrement to a show where the focus was squarely on the songs. There was little banter, though Liam paused between songs to check the audience was having a good time.",
      "\"Was it worth the 40,000 pounds you paid for the ticket?\" he quipped at one point, referring to the scramble for seats that saw some fans pay hundreds to see a show.",
      "From the roar of response, it was.",

      "Founded in the working-class streets of Manchester, England, in 1991, Oasis was one of the dominant British acts of the 1990s, releasing eight U.K. No. 1 albums.",
      "The band's sound was fueled by sing-along rock choruses and the combustible chemistry between guitarist-songwriter Noel Gallagher \u2014 a Beatles and glam rock-loving musician with a knack for memorable tunes \u2014 and younger brother Liam.",
      "Then and since, the brothers have often traded barbs \u2014 onstage, in the studio and in interviews. Liam once called Noel \"tofu boy,\" while Noel branded his brother \"the angriest man you'll ever meet. He's like a man with a fork in a world of soup.\"",
      "After a backstage bustup at a concert in France in 2009, they long resisted pressure to reunite, even with the promise of a multimillion-dollar payday.",
      "Now they have agreed on a tour that sees hem joined by former Oasis members Paul \"Bonehead\" Arthurs and Gem Archer on guitar, bassist Andy Bell and drummer Joey Waronker.",
      "The announcement of the U.K. tour in August sparked a ticket-buying frenzy, complete with error messages, hourslong online queues, dashed hopes and anger at prices that surged at the last minute.",
      "The ticketing troubles sparked questions in U.K. Parliament, where Arts Minister Chris Bryant criticized \"practices that see fans of live events blindsided by price hikes.\" Britain's competition regulator has since threatened Ticketmaster \u2014 which sold around 900,000 Oasis tickets \u2014 with legal action.",
      "No plans have been announced for Oasis to record any new music, and the tour is being presented as a one-off.",
      "Music writer John Aizlewood said that it's an opportunity for Oasis to \"tend the legacy\" of the band, and remind people of the power of the Oasis brand.",

      "The television and entertainment company filed the motion for Chapter 11 protection on Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Texas. The filing comes just weeks after the struggling company laid off 40 employees\u00a0in a second wave of job cuts following the dismissal of roughly a third of its staff in August of 2024.",
      "Merit Street Media launched in 2023 with ambitions of becoming \"one of the most widely distributed startup networks in modern history,\" according to an announcement at the time. The company's broadcast network, formed in partnership with Christian-based Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN), offered a broad lineup of programming featuring popular TV personalities including Nancy Grace, Bear Grylls and Steve Harvey, in addition to McGraw, the face of the network.",
      "\"Merit Street Media will be a resource of information and strategies to fight for America and its families, which are under a cultural 'woke' assault as never before,\" said McGraw at the time of the announcement. \"I love this country and I believe family is the backbone of our society. Together we are going to stand strong and fight for the very soul and sanity of America and get things that matter back on track.\"",
      "In its bankruptcy filing, the Fort Wort, Texas-based company reported assets and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, court records show.",
      "The company on Wednesday also filed a lawsuit against TBN, according to a Merit Street spokesperson.",
      "\"Trinity Broadcasting Network is being sued by Merit Street Media for failing to provide clearly agreed upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network's continuing success and viability,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.\"",
      "Merit Street Media did not immediately reply to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch. Both live and streaming content were still available on the Merittv.com website as of Wednesday.",

      "Chestnut will look to win his 17th Mustard Belt while Beroletti will try to defend his first and only title at the contest.",
      "Why didn't Joey Chestnut compete last year?",
      "Chestnut was banned from the Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest in 2024 because of a sponsorship deal he signed with Impossible Foods, which sells plant-based meat substitutes, including hot dogs.",
      "\"MLE [Major League Eating] and Nathan's went to great lengths in recent months to accommodate Joey and his management team, agreeing to the appearance fee and allowing Joey to compete in a rival unbranded hot dog eating contest on Labor Day,\" Major League Eating, which sanctions the Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest, said in a statement at the time. \"For nearly two decades, we have worked under the same basic hot dog exclusivity provisions. However, it seems that Joey and his managers have prioritized a new partnership with a different hot dog brand over our longtime relationship.\"",
      "Chestnut ended up competing against his old rival, Takeru Kobayashi, in a hot dog eating competition that streamed on Netflix on Labor Day last year. Chestnut won that contest, which followed the same rules as the Nathan's competition.",
      "Chestnut has agreed to only endorse Nathan's hot dogs going forward, so he was allowed to return this year.",
      "Who is expected to win the hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut and Sudo are far and away the favorites to win the men's and women's contests, respectively. Chestnut comes in at an enormous -2000 favorite. Bertoletti is +1200, but comes in at +155 in the Winner Without Chestnut market, according to CBS Sports.",
      "Many sportsbooks aren't even offering odds on the women's side due to Sudo's dominance, according to CBS Sports. However, betting expert Matt Severance told CBS Sports the Under 45.5 for Sudo at -105 could be a worthwhile wager.",
      "Check out CBS Sports for a more detailed breakdown of the hot dog eating contest's odds and predictions.",
      "What is the record amount of hot dogs eaten at a hot dog eating contest?",
      "Chestnut holds both the official and unofficial world records for most hot dogs eaten in a competition. He downed 83 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes during his Labor Day competition against Kobayashi, but since that event wasn't sanctioned by Major League Eating, it's not considered official.",
      "The official world record is 76, also set by Chestnut during the 2021 Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest.",
      "What are the rules for Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest?",
      "The rules for the hot dog eating contest are fairly simple. Competitors have 10 minutes to eat as many hot dogs and buns as possible. They can break the hot dogs up with their hands and separate them from the buns, but the entire thing, hot dog and bun, has to be swallowed for it to count.",
      "Utensils and condiments are prohibited.",
      "Water is provided, but contestants can bring other non-alcoholic beverages if they want. Contestants can dunk the buns in the water or their beverage, but only for a maximum of five seconds.",
      "If a contestant throws up, they're disqualified.",
      "Whoever downs the most hot dogs and buns in the 10-minute time period is the winner.",

      "Madsen apparently went into cardiac arrest and was found unresponsive in his home in Malibu, California, on Thursday morning, manager Ron Smith said.",
      "\"In the last two years Michael Madsen has been doing some incredible work with independent film including upcoming feature films Resurrection Road, Concessions and Cookbook for Southern Housewives, and was really looking forward to this next chapter in his life,\" managers Susan Ferris and Ron Smith and publicist Liz Rodriguez said in a statement.",

      "He began his career at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theater.",
      "\"I am heartbroken to hear of the passing of old friend Mike Madsen,\" Steppenwolf co-founder Terry Kinney said in a statement. \"Although I knew him years ago, it was very memorable, as he acted in a production of 'Of Mice and Men' which I directed. Michael was a car mechanic when we started rehearsals. He wrote long handwritten letters to me for years about how art saved his life. He was wonderful in that production and you could see his future success from the outset. He will be missed.\"",
      "He is perhaps best known for his role as Mr. Blonde in Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut \"Reservoir Dogs,\" and the iconic scene in which he tortures a police officer while the 1973 Stealers Wheel hit \"Stuck in the Middle with You\" plays in the background.",
      "While usually not playing the lead role, his unmistakable gruff voice made him a memorable presence in smaller roles and even bit parts in films like \"Sin City,\" \"Donnie Brasco\" and \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\"",
      "Madsen has also published several collections of poetry, including \"Burning in Paradise\" and \"Expecting Rain.\"",
      "\"His work reflects the same gritty realism and emotional undercurrent that defines his acting,\" his representatives said in a statement. \"In addition to acting and writing, he is an accomplished photographer and has produced a number of independent projects.\"",
      "During a speech at his handprint ceremony at Los Angeles' famous TCL Chinese Theatre in 2020, Madsen reflected, \"I could have been a bricklayer. I could have been an architect. I could have been a garbageman. I could have been nothing. But I got lucky. I got lucky as an actor.\"",
      "Madsen also referenced \"mistakes\" he had made in his life during that speech, which was mainly addressed to his wife, DeAnna Morgan. Madsen pleaded no contest to a DUI charge in 2019, which had come within 10 years of another DUI charge. He was sentenced to four days in jail and five years probation, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "He received a $500 citation for a misdemeanor after allegedly trespassing on a property in 2022, People reported at the time, which came just a month after his son, Hudson, died by suicide at 26. Two years later, he was arrested on a charge of misdemeanor domestic battery and later released after what his representative said was a \"disagreement between Michael and his wife,\" People reported.",

    "summary": "The verdict in the Sean \"Diddy\" Combs trial comes after the high-profile proceedings started in May.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was found guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his federal trial in New York City, but the music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Combs will remain in detention while he awaits his sentencing. Judge Arun Subramanian said later Wednesday he denied bail because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "Combs was convicted of two counts of the prostitution-related charge. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. Prosecutors said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years.",
      "How did Sean \"Diddy\" Combs react to the verdict?",
      "As the jury foreperson announced not guilty on the racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charge involving Combs' former girlfriend, Casandra Ventura \u2014 the R&B singer known as Cassie \u2014 Combs put his hand to his face, his fingers resting on his temples.",
      "When he heard the word \"guilty\" for Count 3, the first prostitution-related charge, he was startled. But then \"not guilty\" came for the second sex trafficking count involving another former girlfriend who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\" Combs held hands with attorney Teny Geragos and leaned in to talk to her.",
      "Combs looked at his family and made prayer hands. He nodded as each juror affirmed the verdict, shaking his fists triumphantly under the table. He made prayer hands to the jury, hugged Geragos and smiled. He mouthed \"thank you\" to attorney Marc Agnifilo.",
      "Combs turned to his family, clasped his hands together and appeared to say: \"I'm coming home.\"",
      "He looked toward the reporters in the courtroom and again shook his fist under the table. Combs leaned forward and nodded in agreement at the jury as the judge thanked them. He then put his face in his hands and smiled. Combs made prayer hands and mouthed \"thank you\" to the jurors a number of times. Then he clasped his hands and kept thanking them. He leaned back and tilted his head up, again putting his face in his hands as though in disbelief.",
      "Combs\u00a0kneeled down on the ground, put his hands on his chair and prayed. He and his family erupted in loud applause, cheering loudly and whistling.",
      "Following the decision, Combs' lawyers argued for him to be released from custody immediately and be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. Prosecutors opposed the defense's request and urged Judge Arun Subramanian to keep Combs detained until his sentencing.",
      "Subramanian acknowledged that Combs didn't want to return to a federal detention center in Brooklyn where he'd been in custody since his arrest last September. Combs shook his head no.",
      "The judge asked both the prosecution and defense to submit letters as to why Combs should be released Wednesday or remain detained.",
      "Combs' attorneys proposed in their letter that a million-dollar bond be posted for him and that his travel be restricted to parts of Florida, California, New York and New Jersey. New Jersey and New York were included to accommodate Combs traveling to attend court and meet with his attorneys.",
      "Combs' attorneys also proposed surrendering his passport and undergoing drug testing when required by the court.",
      "Prosecutors proposed that Combs continued to be detained and his bail application be denied.",
      "The developments come after jurors said Tuesday they'd agreed on four of the five counts against Combs but disagreed on racketeering conspiracy. They reached a verdict on all five counts Wednesday morning.",
      "Jurors began deliberating in U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan on Monday. They said they'd reached a partial verdict Tuesday, but Subramanian sent them back to continue deliberating on the remaining count.",
      "What were the charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs?",
      "The grand jury indictment against the 55-year-old Combs, unsealed in September 2024, initially charged the hip-hop mogul with three counts following his arrest at a Manhattan hotel. In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",
      "Combs pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "The charges against Combs and each verdict were:",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTYCount 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTYCount 3: Transportation to engage in prostitution (Casandra Ventura) - GUILTYCount 4: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (\"Jane\") - NOT GUILTYCount 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "Count 1: Racketeering conspiracy - NOT GUILTY",
      "Count 2: Sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion (Casandra Ventura) - NOT GUILTY",

      "Count 5: Transportation to engage in prostitution (\"Jane\") - GUILTY",
      "What is the Mann Act?",
      "The prostitution-related charges allege violations of the Mann Act, a law that makes it a federal crime to transport someone across state lines for prostitution.",
      "Before jurors began their deliberations, Subramanian gave them instructions on how to apply the law to the facts presented during the trial. Jurors were told that, in order to find Combs guilty of the prostitution-related charges, prosecutors must have proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he knowingly transported an individual in \"interstate or foreign commerce\" and intended that the individual \"engage in an act of prostitution.\"",
      "Subramanian noted that it wasn't necessary for prosecutors to prove that engaging in prostitution was Combs' sole purpose in transporting a person across a state line or foreign border. However, prosecutors needed to prove that a \"significant or motivating purpose\" of the trip was prostitution.",
      "The charge of racketeering conspiracy requires prosecutors to prove a number of elements: that there was an agreement among two or more people to participate in a pattern of activity that would affect interstate commerce; that the defendant willfully joined it; and that members of the conspiracy committed two or more racketeering acts. The charging document lists a number of alleged racketeering acts, including kidnapping, bribery, sex trafficking and forced labor.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Combs' business empire created a criminal enterprise that he used for years to cover up acts of violence and abuse and to coerce women into fulfilling his sexual desires. Jurors heard from more than 30 witnesses over the course of seven weeks as the prosecution went through its case.",
      "Combs denied the accusations but chose not to take the stand to testify in his defense. His attorneys did not call any witnesses during the trial, though they did conduct extensive cross-examinations of the government's witnesses. Combs' lawyers argued the prosecution failed to prove the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\"Freak-offs\" part of emotional and graphic testimony",
      "The high-profile trial, which started in May, included graphic and emotional testimony from two of Combs' former girlfriends.",
      "Ventura, who spent more than a decade with him, testified about drug-fueled sex sessions that Combs allegedly referred to as \"freak-offs.\" Ventura testified that he directed all the encounters, which could last for days, and that she felt forced to participate to make him happy.",
      "Ventura testified that Combs controlled every aspect of her life, and that she often did things out of fear, since physical abuse was \"frequent.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys argued that the encounters were consensual. During cross-examination, the defense showed the jury a 2009 message from Ventura to Combs that read, \"I'm always ready to freak off.\"",
      "Ventura also testified about a 2016 incident which was caught on surveillance video showing Combs beating and kicking her in a California hotel hallway. Combs apologized at the time, saying his behavior was \"inexcusable\" and that he took \"full responsibility\" for his actions.",
      "Ventura testified that the attack happened as she was trying to leave a \"freak-off\" that had turned violent. A former hotel security officer testified that Combs offered him cash after the attack, which the officer said he understood to be a bribe.",
      "Ventura had filed a civil lawsuit against Combs in 2023, accusing him of physically and sexually abusing her. Combs denied the claims and quickly reached a settlement with her. In his closing argument to the jury Friday, Agnifilo said, \"If you had to pick a winner in this whole thing, it's hard not to pick Cassie.\"",
      "Another former girlfriend of Combs testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" to protect her identity. She told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. Jane testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers displayed messages showing her setting up \"hotel nights.\" Jane said she felt pressured and that she had grown financially dependent on Combs.",
      "In the prosecution's closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik described Combs as \"the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "She said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up. \"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Agnifilo countered by arguing that prosecutors \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes, combining it with recreational drug use and calling it a racketeering conspiracy.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs will remain detained after a jury found him guilty Wednesday of transportation to engage in prostitution in his high-profile trial in New York City. The music mogul was acquitted of the more severe charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he denied bail for Combs because he disagreed with the defense's argument that the crimes shouldn't trigger mandatory detention. Combs was convicted of two counts of prostitution-related charges. Each count carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.",
      "Combs will get 10 months credit for time served so far, the judge said Wednesday, proposing a sentencing date of Oct. 3.",
      "After leaving court, Combs' attorney declined to comment on the bail denial, saying \"a lot of these things are still in process.\"",
      "\"We are not nearly done fighting,\" defense attorney Marc Agnifilo told reporters outside U.S. District Court in lower Manhattan. \"Today was a major, major step in the right direction, but we fight on and we're gonna win, and we're not gonna stop until he walks out of prison a free man to his family.\"",
      "Prosecutors previously said their preliminary calculations indicate Combs should get at least 51 to 63 months imprisonment on the two convictions, or a sentence of roughly four to five years. They told the judge Wednesday that Combs is wealthy and capable of fleeing.",
      "Combs has also shown no remorse or regret in abusing his ex-girlfriend \"Jane,\" the prosecution said, adding that the defense's suggestion that Combs slapping Jane while she was in the shower was in self-defense is \"insulting.\"",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution involving Jane. He was also accused of sex trafficking Jane by force, fraud or coercion, a charge the jury found him not guilty of.",
      "Jane had told the court she often participated in what she called \"hotel nights,\" which also involved drugs. She testified she would have sex with a male escort while Combs watched. She said she told Combs many times that she didn't want to have sex with other men and didn't like the \"hotel nights.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Combs had drugs and supplies for another act of prostitution in the New York hotel where he stayed \u2014 and also invited Jane to come \u2014 before he was arrested.",
      "Following the seven-week jury trial, Combs' attorneys moved to have him released from the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn where he has been held during the trial. They argued that the 55-year-old had been acquitted of the most serious charges and that \"continued detention of Mr. Combs is inappropriate.\"",
      "\"He is a man who's in the process of working on himself. He's been a model prisoner,\" Combs' lawyer told the judge. \"I just think we should trust him\" that he's not going to flee, the defense said.",
      "The defense said Combs should be able to return to his Miami home, emphasizing that this was his first conviction. In a filing submitted to the judge on Wednesday, Combs' legal team said he came to New York to surrender because he was \"committed to showing his innocence\" and that Combs should be released pending sentencing.",
      "The attorneys cited conditions under the Bail Reform Act that states \"a defendant who has been found guilty of an offense is entitled to release pending sentencing if the Court finds by 'clear and convincing evidence' that he 'is not likely to flee or pose a danger to the safety of any other person or the community if released.'\"",
      "Federal prosecutors, however, argued that the Bail Reform Act dictates that Combs should remain in custody.",
      "In their filing to the judge, prosecutors said the crimes Combs was convicted of \"constitute crimes of violence and mandate detention following the defendant's conviction.\"",
      "\"As detention is mandatory following a conviction of a Mann Act offense, the Government has been unable to locate a case in which a defendant was released from custody following such a conviction,\" prosecutors said.",

The foreman told Judge Arun Subramanian that the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the racketeering conspiracy charge because they had jurors \"with unpersuadable opinions on both sides.\" The judge told them to keep deliberating, and the jurors were later dismissed for the day.",
      "According to the jury's verdict sheet, there are eight acts under the federal racketeering conspiracy charge: kidnapping, arson, bribery, witness tampering, forced labor, sex trafficking, transportation and inducement to travel for purposes of prostitution, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.",

In April, before the trial began, prosecutors filed additional charges against Combs in a superseding indictment, bringing the total number of counts against him to five.",

Combs told Judge Subramanian that he decided not to testify, saying: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make.

They trust me with a syringe and a needle. For me, it just felt like the best way to pay it forward was to really help my own clients going through this journey.\"",
      "So Costa began seeing patients after hours, helping with hormone injections completely free of charge.",

      "Penta and her wife both went through IVF cycles in hopes of getting pregnant, attempting to handle injections on their own before eventually turning to Alexa.",
      "\"Bruising happens when you're injecting yourself and hit a certain spot in your body. It was very anxiety-provoking, very stressful to have to do it ourselves,\" Penta said.",
      "When asked how it felt to have someone else administer the injection, Penta described it as \"like a weight being lifted.\"",
      "\"It's a lot of shots, a lot of blood draws, a lot of ultrasounds. The number one reason people drop out of the process is that it's so physically hard,\" said Dr. Pietro Bortoletto, co-founder of Dedham-based Terra Fertility.",
      "\"To paint you a picture: When patients start the IVF process, they get a box at home that has dozens of needles, syringes, medications. If it's overwhelming to Alexa, I can't imagine how it feels for the average patient,\" Bortoletto said.",
      "That's why Bortoletto and Costa are now working on making the process feel a little less overwhelming. Their plan: take the pressure off patients by sending trained nurses to administer injections.",
      "It's something Penta and her wife certainly would have turned to if they hadn't had Alexa. They recently celebrated their daughter Ricci's first birthday, and Penta says she wouldn't change a thing.",

    "story": [
      "Former NFL player Corey Parchman appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" Wednesday to discuss his new book \"IVF Playbook for Men,\" sharing his personal experience with infertility and advocating for greater awareness of male fertility issues.",
      "Parchman, now a real estate developer, wrote the book after struggling to find resources for men going through infertility treatments. At least 30% of infertility cases are related to male factors, yet men are less likely to discuss the issue or seek support.",
      "\"As I went through the process, there was nothing out there for men that were going through the process,\" Parchman said. \"There's a ton of information for women, and it should be, because women carry 99% of the load ... So I wanted to create this book as a resource for men.\"",
      "Parchman and his wife, Elisha, endured five IVF cycles over two-and-a-half years, including multiple miscarriages, before welcoming their son. He described receiving the initial diagnosis of male factor infertility as shocking.",
      "\"I asked the doctor to do a recheck. You're not talking about me, are you?\" Parchman recalled. \"It's a shock because as you grow up you think this is the process of having kids. It's as simple as ABC.'\"",
      "The former athlete said he felt like he was being \"the weakest link on the team,\" and worried he had let his partner down. Throughout the process, he struggled with feeling sidelined during a time when he wanted to be actively involved.",
      "\"I'm a person that's a fixer. I fix things. This situation I had to sit back and put the faith in my doctors and my wife,\" he explained. \"Once you get out of your own way and realize it's not about you, it's about your family, the process becomes easier.\"",
      "Parchman said there's an importance of open communication between partners during fertility treatments. He and his wife created what he called a \"safe space\" where they could express their feelings without judgment.",
      "The book also addresses how to handle well-meaning but often misguided advice from friends and family. Parchman advised giving people grace while recognizing that their suggestions may not be helpful.",
      "\"I had friends tell me, 'Eat three eggs and spin around and jump,'\" he said. \"Thanks for the advice, but I'm listening to the doctors.\"",
      "Beyond becoming a father, Parchman said the IVF journey transformed his understanding of masculinity. He now advocates for men to be more vulnerable and open about their struggles.",
      "\"It's being vulnerable, creating a space to express how you feel with your partner or friends,\" he said. \"I want to speak out and tell men it's okay to speak out about your feelings and thoughts because we all have them.\"",

      "Tesla's stock price slumped Monday after CEO Elon Musk's announced over the weekend that\u00a0he has formed a new political party following his acrimonious split from President Trump.",
      "The electric vehicle company's stock fell 6.8%, to $293.94 per share, by market close.",
      "Musk had threatened to form a new political party if the president's massive policy and spending bill passed. The tech billionaire made good on his promise this past Saturday, a day after Mr. Trump\u00a0signed his signature legislation\u00a0into law on July 4.",
      "\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk said on X.",
      "Musk on Friday hinted that his party would be focused on swaying votes in the House and Senate which currently have a razor-thin Republican majority. He said the America Party would focus \"on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts.\"",
      "President Trump responded on Truth Social on Sunday saying Musk was a \"TRAIN WRECK\" and that he had gone \"completely 'off the rails.'\"",
      "Musk has not offered any details on exactly what steps he's taken toward the creation of a new political party, a complicated process which would require compliance with the diverse laws in each state as well as federal rules.",
      "Still, Musk's talk of an America Party could reignite investor worries over the fate of the Tesla brand, which was badly damaged after Musk took on a central role in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk in late May announced he would step back from the Trump administration. Now, after a public falling out with Mr. Trump over the budget bill, it seems Musk is injecting himself back into the Washington political scene.",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:15:23 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S will impose 25% tariffs on goods from South Korea and Japan by August 1, while also threatening to hit five other nations with import duties of up to 40% by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, is scheduled to expire on July 9.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional five trade partners. Myanmar and Laos both face a 40% tariff rate; South Africa imports will be subject to 30% duties; and goods from both Malaysia and Kazakhstan will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. Those tariffs are scheduled to kick in August 1 as well.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"August 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt added that Mr. Trump plans to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump said in each memo that the letter \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% levies apply to \"any and all Japanese products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,\" Mr. Trump added in his letter to Japan's Ishiba. He also warned that if either South Korea or Japan raises tariffs on the U.S., the Trump administration will reciprocate by adding that figure to the 25% baseline rate.",
      "The 25% tariff is in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump said South Korea and Japan would each face when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",

Japan and South Korea were the first recipients, with letters from the Trump administration sent to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung on Monday indicating that 25% tariffs on their respective countries will go into effect on August 1.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure with the EU's stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything \u2014 from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals \u2014 much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU's executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc's 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program on Sunday that \"the EU was very slow in coming to the table\" but that talks were now making \"very good progress.\"",

      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe was crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment.",
      "Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around.",
      "However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "Less-friendly posture toward longstanding ally",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\"On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \"They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\"",
      "U.S. consumers would likely be hurt most",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \"until further notice.\" The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \"significant increases\" in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\"If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\" Arnault said. \"And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\"",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.",
      "Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \"the U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of 'retaliatory' tariffs well beyond 10%,\" Schmieding said. \"However, the road to get there could be rocky.\"",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",

      "Mr. Trump said the \"tariff letters\" would go out at 12:00 p.m. EST, ahead of a July 9 deadline for the U.S.'s trade partners to negotiate deals or else face country-based tariff rates. President Trump announced so-called \"reciprocal tariff\" rates on April 2, which he dubbed \"Liberation Day.\" He instituted a 90-day pause on the country-specific levies, which expires July 9.",
      "\"I am pleased to announce that the UNITED STATES TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World, will be delivered starting 12:00 P.M. (Eastern), Monday, July 7th,\" Trump said on Truth Social late Sunday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter! DONALD J. TRUMP, President of The United States of America.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on which countries would receive letters notifying them of higher tariff rates.",
      "Similar to club membership fee",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that the country-based levies are akin to membership fees guaranteeing entry into a private club.",
      "\"What's been going on since 'Liberation Day' is Trump has been receiving applications for membership,\" Appleton told CBS MoneyWatch. \"He has countries coming to him with proposals of what they would negotiate in the deal.\"",
      "Similar to a club, Appleton said, \"the administration decides what to charge, whether it's full price, friends and family, or a special friends and family rate,\" in reference to the Trump administration'different levies on different nations. \"It depends on what you're going to give him.\"",
      "Appleton added that the U.S. has the ability to charge \"whatever the market will pay, and a lot of countries desperately want access to the U.S.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to announce which countries will be subject to higher tariffs than the baseline 10% rate currently on all imports to the U.S. Those rates would likely\u00a0go into effect Aug. 1, Mr. Trump said Friday. The president had previously said they would kick in on July 9.",
      "\"Good, bad, ugly\" scenarios",
      "Brian Mulberry, portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told CBS MoneyWatch that countries the Trump administration believes have been engaging in good-faith negotiations will not receive notices Monday.",
      "\"Ultimately, countries that have been actively participating in negotiations already will get some type of reciprocal structure,\" he said.",
      "There are three broad outcomes as far as rates go, he added.",
      "\"We have a good, bad, ugly scenario,\" Mulberry said. A 10% tariff rate would be a \"good\" outcome, whereas 20% tariffs would be bad, and anything higher would be considered \"ugly.\"",
      "\"Countries had an opportunity over the past 90 days to make they're best offers, and if you were not participating, you could end up getting a number,\" he said.",

      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "As many as 15 letters will be going out beginning Monday, President Trump confirmed to reporters before heading back to the White House from his New Jersey club on Sunday. Some will go out on Tuesday and Wednesday, he said, adding that \"some deals have been made.\"",

Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "Initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",

      "Questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Mr. Trump will once more push off imposing the rates.",
      "In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries \"where we don't have very much trade\" and where tariffs are already at the baseline of 10%. The treasury secretary also said that the administration is primarily focused on nations with the largest trade deficit with the U.S.",
      "\"There are 18 important trading relationships that account for 95% of our deficit, and those are the ones we're concentrating on,\" Bessent said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I'm not going to give away the playbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Hassett said that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.",
      "Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \"sort of, get the date rolled.\"",
      "The\u00a0steeper tariffs\u00a0that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "With the freeze on\u00a0sweeping U.S. tariffs\u00a0set to expire Wednesday, July 9, the White House\u00a0has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam.\u00a0But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "Bessent said the U.S. was \"close to several deals,\" and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.",
      "\"I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said.",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS News' MoneyWatch.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a deal with Vietnam. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",
      "That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.",
      "Asked if he expected to reach deals with the\u00a0European Union\u00a0or India, Trump said Friday that \"letters are better for us\" because there are so many countries involved.",
      "\"We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\"",
      "Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.",
      "\"Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,\" Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \"We're going to have a deal that's articulated.\"",

      "Though Hassett wouldn't share any details about the countries set to receive the letters, he said the notices could go to both small and large trading partners.

    "story": [
      "President Trump's promise to eliminate federal income tax on worker tips will become a reality Friday when he signs the\u00a0massive budget package\u00a0into law.",
      "After narrowly squeaking through the House\u00a0on Thursday, the \"big, beautiful bill\" now heads to the president's desk for his signature. As part of the legislation, workers who rely on tips for a large share of their income, such as waiters, bartenders and hairdressers, will see relief from federal income tax on those tips.",
      "The White House has framed the tax cuts as a win for the working class. But critics such as the Independent Restaurant Coalition have pushed back on that notion, saying the benefits for tipped workers would be temporary and that this apparent tax cut wouldn't help most low-wage workers.",
      "How does \"no tax on tips\" work?",
      "The \"no tax on tips\" provision in the spending bill creates a new deduction for tipped workers, eliminating what they owe in federal income tax. Tipped workers still have to pay state and local income tax and payroll taxes.",
      "The House and Senate versions\u00a0of the tax and spending bill vary on a few key points, including how much a worker could claim in deductions. The Senate proposal limits that deduction to $25,000, while the House version is uncapped.",
      "Under the House measure, meanwhile, only people with annual income of $160,000 or less would qualify for the tipping tax break, while the Senate version would phase out benefits for individuals whose income exceeds $150,000 or couples whose income exceeds $300,000.",
      "Notably, however, under the budget bill those tip tax cuts would extend only through 2028, and so Congress could restrict or even abolish the tax break in future.",
      "Who benefits?",
      "A May\u00a0report\u00a0from the White House's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that eliminating taxes on tips for eligible workers would increase their average take-home pay by $1,675 per year.",
      "According to the White House, a June survey found that 83% of hourly workers support eliminating taxes on tips. \"These results suggest that any measure increasing the amount of immediately available income \u2014 such as untaxed tips \u2014 would provide meaningful, stabilizing support for a large segment of the hourly workforce,\" according to that report.",
      "Data\u00a0from the Yale Budget Lab shows that roughly 4 million people \u2014 2.5% of the American workforce \u2014 worked in tipped jobs as of 2023. But given the way the budget bill is written, not all will necessarily benefit. The nonpartisan policy research center notes in a recent\u00a0analysis that over a third of tipped workers in the U.S. are already exempt from federal income tax because their earnings are too low.",
      "\"A deduction for tipped work is actually a pretty horrible way to help low-wage workers,\" Ernie Tedeschi, the director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You're only helping a narrow slice of them, and it's not helping the lowest of low-wage workers because they don't have any federal tax liability to begin with.\"",
      "Only about 4% of workers who earn less than $25 per hour also get tips, the group has found. As a result, low-wage servers at many restaurants could\u00a0qualify for the tax break, but fast-food employees might not\u00a0despite earning similar incomes.",
      "\"It's going to help some very, very high earners, along with some middle earners,\" Sylvia Allegretto, senior economist at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The lion's share of low-wage workers, it's not going to touch because they're not tipped workers.\"",
      "A better way to helps low-wage workers, labor advocates say, would be to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009.",
      "\"It's not that these workers pay too much in taxes or that taxes are a problem,\" Allegretto said. \"The problem is they just don't earn enough money.\"",

Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff\u00a0pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fireworks-fourth-of-july-4-drone-shows-2025/",
    "published": "Fri, 04 Jul 2025 05:00:03 -0400",
    "summary": "Dozens of cities across the U.S. will host drone shows on the Fourth of July this year, seeing them as preferable to fireworks. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "July 4 celebrations may look different in some cities this year as they swap the crackle of fireworks for synchronized drone displays.",
      "Independence Day drone shows are planned for dozens of cities across the country, from Salt Lake City to Sarasota, Florida. The shows, produced by a variety of vendors, involve hundreds of illuminated drones programmed to carry out choreographed routines set to catchy songs like \"Firework\" by Katy Perry.",
      "Not everyone is on board with the shift from old-school pyrotechnics, but the companies behind the drone shows promise to deliver all the pomp and circumstance of traditional fireworks shows and more, using awe-inspiring displays that capture the spirit of American independence.",
      "Salt Lake City will be hosting a drone show for the third year in a row. Andrew Wittenberg, a spokesperson for the city's mayor's office, said the main reason for adopting the new Fourth of July display was safety. Drone shows reduce the risk of fires and are touted as a more environmentally friendly option than fireworks which can leave behind debris.",
      "\"We're in drought conditions right now,\" Wittenberg said. \"And so it's a matter of practicality over any sort of other preference.\"",
      "Drone shows are also far much quieter than fireworks, making them more inclusive for people with PTSD and dogs, Jana Cunningham, a communications manager at the Salt Lake City Public Lands Department, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The city expects some 7,500 people for this year's show, which will include the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, among other iconic American images, she said.",
      "That said, drone shows are not accident-proof. Last year, a 7-year-old boy suffered severe injuries after a\u00a0drone crashed and fell\u00a0onto his head during a holiday light show in Florida. The incident prompted New York Road Runners to cancel a drone show it had planned for its annual New Year's Eve run in Central Park.",
      "Read on for more details about drone shows and what ignited their popularity.",
      "How do drone shows work?",
      "Drone shows use the remotely controlled mini-aircrafts to create patterns and animated scenes in the night sky. In the case of Sky Elements Drones \u2014 a big player in the industry for movie events (Marvel, Star Wars), sports events (Seattle SeaHawks half-time show) and more \u2014 the displays can involve thousands of drones and span up to 400-feet high and 400-feet wide.",
      "To produce the shows, Rick Boss, CEO of Sky Elements, said that his design team works with clients to create storyboards, and then programs the drones to get them ready for flight.",
      "\"A 300-drone show might take as much as 80 hours of programming just to make sure every drone knows exactly where it's supposed to be, what color it's supposed to be, throughout its flight path,\" Boss said.",
      "During the drone show performance, Sky Elements has a pilot and co-pilot monitoring a computer to make sure everything is running smoothly. Drones are programmed to stay within a \"geofence,\" Boss said, which sets limits on where the devices can fly and turns off their motors if they fly outside the boundaries.",
      "Some cities, like Nashville,Tennessee, have opted to combine drones with traditional firework displays as a way of\u00a0 increasing the wow factor. This year, the capital city is incorporating 400 drones into its Independence Day show.",
      "Sky Elements said it also has permits to load its drone shows with traditional pyrotechinics, giving them the ability to shoot off fireworks directly.",
      "Growing business",
      "Drone shows have exploded in popularity in recent years as Americans search for safer and more environmentally friendly ways to mark major events. Among the biggest adopters are\u00a0Major League Baseball and the Grammy Awards.",
      "Industry revenue is around $338 million, according to a recent\u00a0report from the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a public policy think tank.",
      "Drone shows started to appear pre-pandemic and really picked up around four years ago, according to Boss. \"The demand has just gone through the roof,\" he said.",
      "In fact, the only thing stopping Sky Elements from hosting more shows is a lack of supply, he added. The company has a fleet of 7,000, which may sound like a lot, but is still not nearly enough to keep up with demand. The company's Fourth of July shows are already sold for next year, he said.",
      "\"Bringing back the boom!\"",
      "Not all places are not ready to break up with traditional firework displays quite yet.",
      "Tahoe City and Kings Beach, which both border Lake Tahoe in California, introduced drone displays two years ago, but are now reversing course this year amid pushback from residents. Kristen Guinn, marketing director of a nonprofit group called North Tahoe Community Alliance, said the two towns made the call after a community survey found that 80% of respondents wanted regular fireworks back.",
      "\"After two years of doing a drone show for Fourth of July festivities, the community has spoken loud and clear \u2014 and the Tahoe City Downtown Association is bringing back the boom!\" reads a statement\u00a0on the group's website.",
      "Galveston, Texas, also returned to traditional fireworks in 2023 after switching to drones in 2022, according to the Rockefeller Institute of Government.",

    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 147,000 jobs in June, with the labor market remaining resilient despite slowing economic growth this year. That figure is in line with the average monthly gain of 146,000 over the last year,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department.",
      "The numbers",
      "Job growth was stronger\u00a0than expected in June. Payroll gains sailed past the 115,000 predicted by economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The nation's unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, down from 4.2% in May and the lowest since February. The jobless rate came in below economist forecasts of 4.3%, according to FactSet.",
      "What it means",
      "June's employment data shows that the labor market remains solid even amid significant uncertainty over U.S. trade and fiscal policy. The upshot is that employers continued to add jobs at a steady pace.",
      "Government employment rose the most in June with 73,000 jobs added, driven by gains in the state and local government education sectors. The federal workforce continues to shed jobs, with 7,000 lost in June. Massive cuts in federal jobs by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, earlier this year have gutted several key agencies. Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas says DOGE layoffs have accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year.",
      "The health care sector added 39,000 jobs.",
      "The Labor Department also revised up its numbers for April and May by a collective 16,000, a further indication the job market remains on solid ground.",
      "While the labor market remains sturdy, economists expect growth to slow in the second half of the year. Federal Chair Jerome Powell has\u00a0said tariffs could start to hobble economic activity and drive up inflation this summer. At a gathering of central bankers in Portugal earlier this week, Powell said\u00a0the Fed has held off lowering interest rates this year because of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "What the experts are saying",

      "The healthy level of job growth likely means the Fed will hold off cutting rates at its meeting this month, experts say. At its most recent meeting, the central bank penciled in two rate cuts by year-end, although some economists predict just one.",
      "Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, thinks U.S. inflation stemming from tariffs is likely to peak by the fourth quarter, giving the Fed room to lower rates in December to propel economic growth.",

    "summary": "The budget bill passed by Congress on Thursday pulls the plug on federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "The massive tax and spending cut bill that Congress passed Thursday ends federal tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Buyers have until Sept. 30 to qualify for the federal tax credits on EVs before they are terminated. But experts say there are still strong financial reasons to consider buying the vehicles even without those incentives.",
      "Before the bill passed, new electric vehicles came with a $7,500 federal tax credit, and used EVs included up to $4,000. Those incentives were originally designed to help make the vehicles more affordable.",
      "According to the latest data from Kelley Blue Book, the average purchase price of a new EV is roughly $9,000 higher in the United States than the average new gas-powered car. Used EVs on average cost $2,000 more than comparable gas cars.",
      "Pricier EVs",
      "Those credits, paired with other incentives in many states, helped bridge that price gap. Without them, Senior Policy Director Ingrid Malmgren of the nonprofit advocacy group Plug In America said they will become unaffordable to many lower- and middle-income Americans.",
      "\"That's really disappointing because ... they're just a really great way to reduce transportation energy cost burden,\" Malmgren said.",
      "The up-front cost of an electric vehicle might be higher, but for those who can afford to consider the lifetime fuel and maintenance savings, Malmgren said the EV is still a good financial and environmental move in every state.",
      "That is because electric vehicles might not be cheaper to buy, but they are cheaper to drive. Malmgren said that even without the federal tax credits, an electric vehicle owner would still come out ahead.",
      "\"Quickly you'll end up paying less than a gas car because it costs much less to fuel, and it needs almost nothing for maintenance,\" Malmgren said.",
      "Malmgren said the point at which an EV driver's savings on fuel and maintenance outweigh the higher initial price varies. It depends on the kind of car and how often they are driven, as well as the cost of gasoline and electricity in an area. She said EV owners pay less in upkeep because the cars typically have fewer moving parts to maintain and require less frequent servicing. There are multiplecalculators online that pinpoint that moment based on some of those criteria.",
      "How much you save",
      "A 2020 study in the academic journal Joule found that the average EV in the U.S. charged with a typical mix of public and private chargers saves the driver $7,700 in fuel costs over a 15-year life span, compared to filling a car with gas.",
      "Savings vary by state. The study found that someone charging a car at home during off-peak hours, deemed as a best-case scenario, could save more than $14,000 over 15 years in Washington, where electricity is relatively affordable. The study said that an EV driver in any state exhibiting typical driving and charging behavior would save money on fuel costs. The study did not account for the car's purchase price, its maintenance cost or associated tax credits.",
      "Manufacturing an electric vehicle typically creates more pollution than making a traditional gas-powered one. But experts say that driving an EV over the long-term is still less polluting than a gas car.",
      "Once they both drive about 15,000 miles (24,000 km) \u2014 slightly more than the average American drives in a year \u2014 the total pollution that has gone into making and driving each type of car has evened out, said Peter Slowik, U.S. Passenger Vehicles Lead for the International Council on Clean Transportation.",
      "Every mile after that widens the gap between the cleaner electric car and the more pollutive gas car. By the end of the car's life, emissions caused by the average EV are roughly half the average gas car, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Cleaner machine",
      "So unless you buy a new car each year, the EV is the cleaner choice, he said.",
      "\"They are a no-brainer,\" Slowik said. \"Electric vehicles are already inherently so much more efficient.\"",
      "A 2023 analysis by Yale Climate Connections found that electric vehicles are responsible for less carbon dioxide pollution even in areas where the electricity used to charge them comes from coal. An EV in West Virginia, which is one of the most coal-reliant states, still pollutes 31% less than an equivalent gas-powered car, according to the analysis.",
      "Slowik said that is because electric cars are better at translating energy into forward motion. For example, the most popular EVs in the U.S., the Tesla Model Y and the Tesla Model 3, can drive more than 100 miles (161 km) on energy equivalent to what is provided by a gallon of gasoline.",
      "\"If you compare that to a 25-mpg gasoline vehicle, that's already four to five times more efficient,\" Slowik said.",

      "The administration is holding back over $6 billion in federal grants for after-school and summer programs, English language instruction, adult literacy and more as it conducts a review to ensure grants are aligned with President Trump's priorities.",
      "The move creates uncertainty for states and schools as they budget for programs this summer and in the upcoming school year because they don't know if or when they'll receive the funding. Democrats say the administration is flouting the law by holding back congressionally appropriated money.",
      "Without the funds, schools say they won't be able to provide free or affordable after-school care for low-income kids while their parents work and may not be able to hire staff to teach children who are learning English. Classes or camps underway this summer could be in jeopardy, too.",
      "The Boys and Girls Clubs of America depend on some of this funding to run their camps and other summer programming for low-income students. If it's not restored soon, the programming could end mid-season, said Boys and Girls Club President Jim Clark.",
      "After-school programming in the fall could also take a hit. \"If these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\" Clark said. As many as 926 Boys and Girls Clubs could close, affecting more than 220,000 kids, the group said.",
      "Programs relying on the money were expecting it to be distributed July 1, but an Education Department notice issued Monday announced the money would not be released while the programs are under review. The department didn't provide a timeline and warned that \"decisions have not yet been made\" on grants for the upcoming school year.",
      "\"The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,\" Education Department officials wrote in the notice, which was obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The department referred questions to the Office of Management and Budget, which did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "In Gadsden City Schools in Alabama, officials say they'll have no choice but to shutter their after-school program, which serves more than 1,200 low-income students, if federal funds aren't released. There's no other way to make up for the frozen federal money, said Janie Browning, who directs the program.",
      "Families who rely on after-school programs would lose an important source of child care that keeps children safe and engaged while their parents work. The roughly 75 employees of the district's after-school programs may lose their jobs.",
      "\"Those hours between after school and 6 o'clock really are the hours in the day when students are at the most risk for things that may not produce great outcomes,\" Browning said. \"It would be devastating if we lost the lifeline of afterschool for our students and our families.\"",
      "Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, said withholding the money could cause lasting damage to the economy.",
      "Some advocates fear the grants are being targeted for elimination, which could force schools to cut programs and teachers. Mr. Trump's 2026 budget proposal called on Congress to zero out all of the programs under review, signaling the administration sees them as unnecessary.",
      "Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington pressed the Trump administration to spend the money as Congress intended.",
      "\"Every day that this funding is held up is a day that school districts are forced to worry about whether they'll have to cut back on afterschool programs or lay off teachers instead of worrying about how to make sure our kids can succeed,\" Murray said in a statement.",
      "The six grant programs under review include one known as 21st Century Community Learning Centers. It's the primary federal funding source for after-school and summer learning programs and supports more than 10,000 local programs nationwide, according to the Afterschool Alliance. Every state runs its own competition to distribute the grants, which totaled $1.3 billion this fiscal year.",
      "Also under review are $2 billion in grants for teachers' professional development and efforts to reduce class size; $1 billion for academic enrichment grants, often used for science and math education and accelerated learning; $890 million for students who are learning English; $376 million to educate the children of migrant workers; and $715 million to teach adults how to read.",
      "These programs account for over 20% of the federal money the District of Columbia receives for K-12 education, according to an analysis by the Learning Policy Institute, a think tank. California alone has over $800 million in limbo, while Texas has over $660 million.",
      "\"Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year,\" said Tony Thurmond, California's state superintendent, in a statement. \"The Administration is punishing children when states refuse to cater to Trump's political ideology.",
      "The loss of funds could \"put several more school districts in extreme financial distress,\" said Chris Reykdal, superintendent of public instruction in Washington state. Districts have already adopted budgets, planned programming and hired staff, assuming they'd receive the money, Reykdal said.",
      "If the funding freeze remains, children learning English and their parents would be especially affected. Some districts use the money to pay for summer programming designed for English learners, family engagement specialists who can communicate with parents and professional development training for staff. Rural districts would be hit the hardest.",
      "\"They're trying to send a message,\" said Amaya Garcia, who oversees education research at New America, a left-leaning think tank. \"They don't believe that taxpayer funding should be used for these children.\"",
      "Umatilla School District in rural eastern Oregon \u2014 with a sizable population of migrant families and students learning English \u2014 relies heavily on federal funding for its after-school and summer school programs. Superintendent Heidi Sipe says she is meeting with state officials soon to find out if the district will have to plan an early end to summer school, an option 20% of students are using. Come this fall, if federal money stays frozen, she'll have to lay off staff and eliminate after-school programs attended by around half the district's students.",
      "\"It's an essential service in our community because we don't have any licensed child care centers for school-age children,\" she said.",
      "Sipe said it's particularly frustrating to deal with these funds being put into limbo because the school district was in the middle of a five-year grant period.",
      "\"It feels preventable,\" she said, \"and it feels as though we could have done a better job planning for America's children.\"",
      "Associated Press correction: In a story published July 1 about the Trump administration withholding more than $6 billion for schools, The Associated Press erroneously reported the amount of money in limbo in California and Texas. California has at least $800 million in limbo, not $800,000, and Texas has more than $660 million in limbo, not $660,000. This article has been updated.",

      "Firings by the task force led to a spike in federal worker cuts earlier this year at the\u00a0Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Education, USAID\u00a0and other agencies.\u00a0Thousands also departed through a deferred resignation program.",

      "Tariff hit",
      "An economic slowdown and rocky financial markets has led companies to shed more than 154,000 jobs this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024.",
      "\"Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,\" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. \"If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry.\"",

      "Facing hefty tariffs on parts shipped from China, one small business owner took the hit by redeeming over 1.8 million reward points on his American Express card. Robert Keeley, owner of Keeley Electronics, a roughly 33-person guitar pedal company in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told CBS MoneyWatch he used the points, rather than cash, to cover the tariffs.",
      "That unusual approach, first reported by Bloomberg, highlights the challenges many smaller enterprises are facing in coping with higher import duties.",
      "Keeley's operation makes pedals used to create effects for electric and some acoustic guitars in a 17,000 square-foot warehouse in Oklahoma. But he's been unable to source one of the pedals' key components, a so-called potentiometer from anywhere other than China, leading to ballooning tariff charges.",
      "\"We manufacture and build nearly every part of the pedals in our factory, including the aluminum enclosures and all the circuit boards,\" Keeley told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I really love manufacturing and giving someone a job.\"",
      "Keeley said his team has tried to find a provider of potentiometers, which control voltages, outside of China, but to no avail.",

      "$11,000 credit card bill",
      "Tariffs on the key component have surged since the start of President Trump's second term in January, according to Keeley. His business was on the hook for tariffs of 25% until March, when the duties temporarily shot up to more than 100%. Now the company pays a rate of 55% for potentiometers, he said.",
      "A 90-day freeze on country-based tariffs, including those in place on China, expires on July 9. Keeley is hoping the current rate will come down, but uncertainty lingers. Trade experts also say Mr. Trump could again extend the tariff pause if trade deals are not reached by the deadline.",
      "Keeley's most recent credit card bill, which included shipping and tariff fees, totaled nearly $11,000, according to a copy of the statement viewed by CBS MoneyWatch. Instead of paying cash, Keeley used the credit card points he'd accrued by paying previous tariff charges with plastic.",
      "\"I decided to use my points because I wasn't redeeming them for other things like gift cards. So I thought it would be clever to apply them to my bills for tariffs,\" Keeley said, noting that the charge is only a sliver of his tariff-related cost. \"It sounds like a lot of points, and that gives you a sense of how much I am paying in tariffs.\"",
      "Keeley emphasized he doesn't like depending on China for manufacturing his company's wares, saying that amounts to what he described as a \"single point of failure.\" Although he hasn't yet raised prices for customers to offset the higher costs, the business may have no choice but to do so if stiff tariffs on Chinese imports remain in place, he told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "summary": "New study\u200b ranks the best job markets in the U.S. based on commute times, access to employer health insurance and other factors.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to finding a job, where you look can be just as important as who you know.",
      "A new analysis by SmartAsset sought to identify the best job markets around the U.S. by ranking 348 cities based on six metrics: unemployment rate; rate of income growth; percentage of workers with employer-sponsored health insurance; typical commute time; percentage of remote workers; and median housing payments as a share of income.",
      "Read on to find which cities have the most to offer U.S. workers.",
      "Which cities have the best overall job market?",
      "Bend, Oregon, has the top job market in the United States, according to SmartAsset. The West Coast city notched points for its low unemployment rate (3.1%) and high income growth. From 2020 to 2023, the median income in Bend grew 44% \u2014 the fourth highest rate after Richmond, Virginia, (50%); Nampa, Idaho, (47%); and Dayton, Ohio, (45%).",
      "A hub for outdoor recreation, Bend also stands out for its work-life balance. The median commute time for workers in Bend is 16 minutes, with just over a quarter of the city's population working remotely.",
      "Trailing Bend in the No. 2 and No. 3 spots for best overall job markets are Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington.",
      "Which cities have the highest percentage of health care coverage for workers?",
      "For workers looking for solid health care coverage, a move to Santa Clara, California, may be worth considering. Over 88% of the population in the southern Bay Area city have private health insurance plans through their employer. Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Bellevue, Washington, follow close behind with roughly 87% of their residents having health coverage through their employers.",
      "Which cities have the shortest commutes?",
      "Spending large chunks of time sitting on a train or stuck in traffic is not conducive to good work-life balance. For that reason, cities with the shortest commute times contribute to top job market rankings in SmartAssets' study.",
      "With a median commute time of roughly 14 minutes, workers in Wichita Falls, Texas, have one the shortest commute times in the country, according SmartAsset. Abilene, Texas, and Topeka, Kansas, workers also spend less time in transit than others, with median commutes of around 14 and 15 minutes, respectively.",
      "Which cities are remote-work friendly?",
      "When it comes to cities with the highest percentage of remote workers, Frisco, Texas, part of the Dallas-Fort Worth metro, stands out from the crowd, with over 32% of workers conducting their jobs remotely. Berkeley, California, and Charlotte, North Carolina, also embrace work from home with a total 29% and 28% remote workers, respectively.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/big-beautiful-bill-social-security-tax-trump/",
    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:15:23 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said the U.S will impose 25% tariffs on goods from South Korea and Japan by August 1, while also threatening to hit five other nations with import duties of up to 40% by next month.",
      "Mr. Trump posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, is scheduled to expire on July 9.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional five trade partners. Myanmar and Laos both face a 40% tariff rate; South Africa imports will be subject to 30% duties; and goods from both Malaysia and Kazakhstan will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. Those tariffs are scheduled to kick in August 1 as well.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"August 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt added that Mr. Trump plans to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump said in each memo that the letter \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% levies apply to \"any and all Japanese products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,\" Mr. Trump added in his letter to Japan's Ishiba. He also warned that if either South Korea or Japan raises tariffs on the U.S., the Trump administration will reciprocate by adding that figure to the 25% baseline rate.",
      "The 25% tariff is in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump said South Korea and Japan would each face when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",
      "Trump administration officials have said stiff U.S. tariffs can ensure fair global trade while also boosting the American manufacturing sector.",

But President Trump, who ran on mass deportation and hardline immigration policies, has sought to severely limit TPS, as his administration works towards what the president has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.",

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said to Justice Department attorney Bridget O'Hickey, \"You made three arguments, defendants, and none are availing \u2026 meritless.\"",
      "Xinis, who had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. after he was sent to El Salvador in March, questioned O'Hickey about whether the U.S. had indicted him in order to facilitate his return. The government did not notify Xinis or Abrego Garcia's attorneys when he was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was part of a group of more than 250 Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador and held in CECOT, a maximum security prison, in mid-March. Soon afterward, he sued the government over his deportation. His amended suit asks Xinis that he be held in custody in Maryland, rather than in Tennessee, where he's currently being detained, as well as to block his deportation.",
      "\"Obviously you did have power to produce Mr. Abrego because you produced him less than a week later.\" Xinis told the government, citing the May 21 date of a sealed indictment against Abrego Garcia in Tennessee filed six days after a motion in Maryland that said the government had no power to return him to the U.S.",
      "Xinis said she found it \"highly problematic\" that there had been a plan by the government to investigate Abrego Garcia and bring him back for prosecution without informing her court that it was doing so. \"We knew it was coming because eventually it was unsealed,\" she said. Abrego Garcia's attorneys told Xinis they found out about his return to the U.S. from news reports.",
      "Abrego Garcia was transported to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted on human trafficking charges in Tennessee that stemmed from a traffic stop in 2019. He is being held in Tennessee pending trial.",
      "Arguing that Abrego Garcia's lawsuit should be dismissed, O'Hickey said the government had been in ongoing conversations with El Salvador to bring him back to the U.S. at the same time the Justice Department filed its motion to dismiss.",
      "\"How can this representation be one I can credit,\" Xinis asked.",
      "\"At some point, don't you have an obligation to me to say, 'Judge, we have the power, we produced him, moot,'\" she asked O'Hickey.",
      "She questioned whether the department's attorneys in Abrego Garcia's case knew the indictment in Tennessee was coming.",
      "O'Hickey said that at the time, the U.S. was still negotiating with El Salvador, and \"it was uncertain what agreement would be released with the foreign sovereign and how all that would play out.\"",
      "\"The proceedings were moving in tandem and negotiations were ongoing,\" O'Hickey said. She told Judge Xinis, \"Defendants certainly took steps to facilitate his return.\"",
      "\"Is the indictment one of those steps? Since we are talking about my court order,\" Xinis replied.",
      "Abrego Garcia \"wasn't under investigation until April \u2026 a month after this case started,\" Xinis said, a contention O'Hickey denied.",
      "\"I don't believe that's true, your honor,\" O'Hickey responded, contradicting law enforcement statements in Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee.",
      "Xinis also denied a second motion to dismiss by the Justice Department, which argued that the lawsuit is now moot, since Abrego Garcia is now in the U.S.",
      "She expressed concern that if Abrego Garcia were released from custody, he could be removed again, but listed actions the government could take to assure the court that her order would be followed.",
      "The government could \"name a specific country (where Abrego Garcia could be deported) and then give a reasonable amount of time\" to challenge that removal, Xinis said. And she offered that the government could \"clarify all of this\" in a \"binding way,\" if it stipulated that he would receive due process \u2014 that he would not be removed without notice and would have the opportunity to be heard before a court.",
      "Referring to his deportation as an \"isolated error,\" O'Hickey said, \"We've acknowledged this was an error and have now acknowledged that error and have no intention of making that error a second time.\"",
      "\"For three months your clients told the world they weren't going to do anything to bring him back,\" Xinis responded. \"Doesn't that matter?\" The president said it in two interviews. [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi] Noem said it. Arguably, [Attorney General Pam] Bondi said it. Am I really supposed to ignore all that?\"",
      "\"I have been told that there was no error,\" Xinis said, and denying the government's second motion to dismiss, ruled, \"I don't find at the moment that this case is moot.\"",
      "Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn said that if Abrego Garcia were released from pretrial detention in Tennessee while his criminal case unfolds, that the Department of Homeland Security intends to remove him from the U.S., but the government has not yet decided whether to remove him to a third country or challenge a previous court order that bars his removal to El Salvador.",

      "The Justice Department and FBI said in their memo that video footage reviewed by bureau investigators\u00a0 \u2014 and made available to the public \u2014 confirmed that Epstein was locked in his cell and nobody entered tiers of the unit where he was housed at the time of his death.",

Files related to Epstein's case, as well as the circumstances surrounding his death, have been the subject of conspiracy theories for years.

      "While Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, the purported document never materialized.",
      "In February, a group of 15 right-wing social media influencers went to the White House and were given binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The influencers said they received the binders from Bondi during a meeting that Mr. Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance also attended.",
      "But any hopes of new information were quickly dashed, as the social media figures said the binders contained documents that were already in the public domain. Bondi confirmed that the first tranche of declassified files largely contained records that were leaked but had not been made public by the federal government.",
      "Still, after Elon Musk and Mr. Trump had a falling out last month, the billionaire entrepreneur claimed that the administration had withheld the so-called Epstein files because the president was named in them. In response, Mr. Trump shared a social media post that rebuffed Musk's claim.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that any alleged links between him and Epstein were \"old news,\" and said he had not been friendly with the convicted sex offender for 18 years before his death.",

      "\"That's why the attorney general and the FBI director pledged, at the president's direction, to do an exhaustive review of all of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and his death, and they put out a memo in conclusion of that review,\" she said. \"There was material they did not release, because, frankly, it was incredibly graphic and it contained child pornography, which is not something that's appropriate for public consumption. But they committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did, and they provided the results of that.\"",
      "When asked about the \"client list\" that Bondi said was on her desk, Leavitt said the attorney general was referring to \"the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "The FBI and Justice Department said in their memo that the review confirmed that Epstein harmed more than 1,000 victims, each of whom suffered \"unique trauma.\"",

      "Initially comprised of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, the group now also includes Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "Mr. Trump did not specify what exactly would trigger the added BRICS tariff.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also told reporters Sunday that higher tariffs could go into effect Aug. 1 for countries that don't make a deal by Wednesday.",
      "Questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether Mr. Trump will once more push off imposing the rates.",
      "In an interview with CNN on Sunday, Bessent said about 100 letters will be sent to small countries \"where we don't have very much trade\" and where tariffs are already at the baseline of 10%. The treasury secretary also said that the administration is primarily focused on nations with the largest trade deficit with the U.S.",
      "\"There are 18 important trading relationships that account for 95% of our deficit, and those are the ones we're concentrating on,\" Bessent said.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday.",
      "\"We'll see,\" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. \"I'm not going to give away the playbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Hassett said that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations.",
      "Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could \"sort of, get the date rolled.\"",
      "The\u00a0steeper tariffs\u00a0that Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "With the freeze on\u00a0sweeping U.S. tariffs\u00a0set to expire Wednesday, July 9, the White House\u00a0has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam.\u00a0But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "Bessent said the U.S. was \"close to several deals,\" and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details.",
      "\"I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,\" Bessent said.",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS News' MoneyWatch.",
      "Mr. Trump last week announced a deal with Vietnam. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. would levy 20% tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam, and a 40% tariff on \"any transshipping.\" The president said Vietnam would \"'OPEN THEIR MARKET TO THE UNITED STATES,' meaning that, we will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff.\"",
      "That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April \u2014 one of his so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit.",
      "Asked if he expected to reach deals with the\u00a0European Union\u00a0or India, Trump said Friday that \"letters are better for us\" because there are so many countries involved.",
      "\"We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.\"",
      "Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed.",
      "\"Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,\" Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. \"We're going to have a deal that's articulated.\"",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures.",
      "Hoekstra would not commit to a date for a trade agreement and said even with a deal, Canada could still face some tariffs. But \"we're not going to send Canada just a letter,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",
      "Later on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-new-america-political-party-trump-feud-harder-than-it-sounds/",
    "published": "Sun, 06 Jul 2025 21:22:32 -0400",
    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk is floating a new political party dubbed the \"America Party\" \u2014 but the idea could face major hurdles.",
    "story": [
      "As billionaire Elon Musk feuds with President Trump over his signature tax and domestic policy legislation, Musk has reupped his calls to launch a new political party \u2014 a daunting task even for the wealthiest person on Earth.",
      "Musk first floated launching a third party, dubbed the \"America Party,\" earlier this month, part of a nasty back-and-forth between the president and the Tesla CEO that marked the likely end of their political alliance. The billionaire raised the idea of a third party again last week as lawmakers raced to send the One Big Beautiful Bill Act to Mr. Trump's desk \u2014 saying he would start the party if Congress passed what he\u00a0described as\u00a0an \"insane spending bill.\"",
      "On Saturday, a day after Mr. Trump signed the bill into law, Musk wrote in a social media post that the \"America Party\" had formed after\u00a0polling his followers on X.",
      "\"By a factor of 2 to 1, you want a new political party and you shall have it!\" Musk said in the post. \"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy.  Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Mr. Trump reacted to the idea of Musk's new party, saying it would cause \"total disruption and chaos.\" The president also said Musk is \"off the rails\" and was \"becoming a train wreck\" over the past five weeks.",
      "Musk did not offer any other details on the formation of the \"America Party\" this weekend, and it's unclear what steps he has taken so far.",
      "Since Musk decided to launch a new political party, he'll need to contend with a thicket of complicated state laws, time-consuming ballot access rules and intense litigation.",
      "\"Only the richest person in the world could make a serious effort at creating a new American political party,\" Brett Kappel, a veteran election lawyer, told CBS News last week.",
      "Navigating 50 different state laws \u2014 and federal rules",
      "\"Political parties are creatures of the states,\" Kappel said.",
      "Each state has different legal rules for recognizing which political parties can appear on the ballot, and those hurdles \"range from high to extraordinarily difficult to overcome,\" he noted. In some cases, a nascent state party may need to get candidates onto the ballot by submitting large numbers of signatures and then win a certain percentage of the vote across election cycles.",
      "For example, to qualify in California, a new political party needs to either sign up 0.33% of the state's voters \u2014 or about 75,000 people \u2014 as registered members, or submit signatures from 1.1 million voters. After that, in order to remain qualified, parties have to either maintain that 0.33% registration threshold or win at least 2% of the vote in a statewide race.",
      "And to gain recognition at the national level, each state-level political party would need to seek an advisory opinion from the Federal Election Commission.",
      "These efforts would almost certainly face intense pushback from the Democratic and Republican parties, including legal challenges over signatures in each state, requiring Musk \u2014 or any other aspiring third-party founder \u2014 to spend scores of money on litigation.",
      "\"The state laws in all of the states are biased towards the two major political parties, and make it as difficult as possible for the emergence of a third political party,\" Kappel told CBS News.",
      "The process of creating a political party with national ambitions would be time-consuming, too. Kappel says it might be doable \u2014 albeit difficult \u2014 for Musk to get a few favored candidates onto the ballot in certain states, but building an entirely new national party would likely take years, and would not be possible by the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Musk wrote on X Friday\u00a0that a nascent political party could \"laser-focus on just 2 or 3 Senate seats and 8 to 10 House districts,\" arguing, \"that would be enough to serve as the deciding vote on contentious laws.\" On Sunday, Musk said he initially plans to focus on congressional races, but\u00a0\"Backing a candidate for president is not out of the question.\"",
      "For evidence of how challenging the process of forming a new national party is, look no further than the struggles that existing third parties have faced. The Green Party and Libertarian Party were each founded decades ago, and still engage in state-by-state pushes for ballot access and party recognition.",
      "\"The hurdles for creating a new party and getting it on the ballot are extremely high. It can be done if you have endless amounts of money, but it's a multi-year project and will cost hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Kappel said.",
      "Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge the issues himself on Sunday, saying Musk \"even wants to start a Third Political Party, despite the fact that they have never succeeded in the United States - The System seems not designed for them.\"",
      "Musk's campaign cash",
      "The high cost of launching a political party may not be a big stumbling block for Musk, whose net worth exceeds $350 billion according to Forbes and Bloomberg's valuations.",
      "The Tesla and SpaceX leader spent a staggering $277 million to aid Mr. Trump and other Republican candidates in the 2024 election cycle. The bulk of that spending, roughly $239 million, was routed through America PAC, a political action committee founded by Musk that underwrote a sprawling get-out-the-vote effort across the swing states.",
      "Since then, Musk has hinted that he plans to dial back his involvement in politics. His tenure leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency ended in May, a month after telling Tesla shareholders his work with the federal government will \"drop significantly.\" He also said at the Qatar Economic Forum in May that he will \"do a lot less\" political spending moving forward, noting he doesn't \"currently see a reason\" to keep opening his wallet.",
      "If Musk follows through on his proposal to launch a competitor to the two mainstream parties, it would mark an expensive return to the fray \u2014 and the laws around how to finance it are complex.",
      "Before new political parties are formally recognized, they are typically organized as not-for-profit groups, and their financial backers do not face any dollar limits to their donations, Kappel says. But once a party gains national recognition, donors like Musk would be subject to the FEC's caps on political contributions. Currently, individuals can only give $10,000 a year to a state political party, or $44,300 a year to a national party committee, the FEC says.",
      "The rules governing when organizations are subject to those limits are byzantine. Almost two decades ago, the FEC said a group called Unity08 \u2014 which aimed to create a bipartisan presidential ticket \u2014 must register as a political committee if it spends over $1,000 trying to get ballot access. After a lengthy legal battle, an appeals court reversed that decision.",
      "Another way for Musk to keep wielding political influence would be through America PAC. The group is organized as a super PAC, which allows Musk to donate unlimited sums of money but requires the group to remain officially independent from candidates or political parties.",
      "Even as he mused about launching a third party, Musk implied this week he could remain engaged in Republican politics. The billionaire suggested he will back primary challenges against GOP lawmakers who voted for the Trump-endorsed One Big Beautiful Bill Act. He also vowed to lend support to Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who voted against the bill and is facing a Trump-backed primary contest.",
      "The president, for his part, has said in recent days that Musk appears to be \"upset\" that his signature tax and domestic policy bill would phase out electric vehicle tax credits \u2014 which could\u00a0cost Tesla billions. Some of Musk's criticisms of the bill have focused on its steep cuts to green energy incentives, though he has also argued the bill is too expensive.",
      "\"I think Elon is a wonderful guy, and I know he's going to do well always,\" Mr. Trump told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in an interview that aired in late June. \"But he got a little bit upset, and that wasn't appropriate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said Sunday on Truth Social that Musk previously told him that he \"had no problems\" with the elimination of the electric vehicle mandate, \"which would have forced everyone to buy an Electric Car in a short period of time.\"",

      "I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday, as you know. That 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the president announced back in April is set to end. So far, the U.S. has announced a few deals, the U.K., Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China.",

      "And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the U.S. And exactly what the numbers will be will be things that you will find out in the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And, Kevin, you said there are going to be deals.",
      "For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the president going to extend this pause?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines and there are things that are close. And so maybe things will push back the dead \u2013 past the deadline, or maybe they won't.",
      "In the end, the president is going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them.",
      "Do you \u2013 can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I'm sorry, I can't, because \u2013 because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening, right, is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making in the deal, and so we're saying, OK, fine we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too.",
      "Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both.",
      "But also don't forget that, when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday.",
      "Less than two weeks ago, the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So I wonder if \u2013 how can companies plan if the goalposts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right.",
      "Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals, like the U.K. and the Vietnam deal, that are starting to be, I guess, guidelines for what might happen.",
      "But one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me is that people are just onshoring production to the U.S. at a record rate. And so we have had record job creation, record capital spending. And this is even ahead of the Big Beautiful Bill. And so I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs, more than two million jobs since he took office, and raising wages.",
      "You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so I think there's a race right now to get activity into the U.S. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I remember, after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there are about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the president.",
      "How close \u2013 if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes, you will have \u2013 you will have to get that from Jamieson and the president. I think that we have seen lots of deals that have been finalized by negotiators, and then the president finds things that can make them better.",
      "And so it's \u2013 I'm not going to get ahead of the president on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK, thanks, Kevin. We will look out for that.",
      "I want to move now to the One Big Beautiful Bill that\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Yes.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 of course, the president signed into law on Independence Day.",
      "You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors an interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit.",
      "I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand\u2026",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Sure.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: \u2026 why there is such a drastic difference between your numbers and all those others.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well \u2013 well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy.",
      "Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time when I was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said \u2013 and we were criticized soundly \u2013 that we would get 3 percent growth.",
      "And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3 percent growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that, if you get 3 percent growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for.",
      "They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But the thing that disappoints me is that, if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3 percent growth, and then it turns out it's 1.5 percent growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss?",
      "These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table and said, we're going to get that 3 percent growth, and then we got it right last time. And we believe we're going to get it right this time.",
      "But if you think that 1.8 percent growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that, if we don't pass the bill, then it's the biggest tax hike in history.",
      "And with that big tax hike, then, of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4 percent drop in GDP and lose nine million jobs. If we had a 4 percent drop in GDP and we lost nine billion jobs, what would happen to the deficit?",
      "And so I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist in Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I want to talk to you, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the president disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about.",
      "And that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Well, yes, let's unbundle that a little bit, because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing?",
      "So what we're doing is, we're asking for a work requirement, but the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance doesn't make a lot of sense to us.",
      "And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers they say that people are going to lose insurance, about five million of those are people who have other insurance. There are people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured.",
      "And so the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all, but, on the other side, go back to 2017, when we had work requirements for Obamacare, and they said that we'd lose about four million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up, went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million, over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job.",
      "And we have got a Big Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance. And the CBO is just not accounting for that.",
      "And, again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20 percent. They should look back at all the things they got wrong and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future and to do a better job. And if they do that, we will take them more seriously.",
      "But, right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they have done so wrong \u2013 been so wrong for so long. Even back \u2013 if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid and so on.",
      "And so their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could kind of roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, a better history, track record history, than CBO.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too, that the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance?",
      "That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud and abuse that I know you and the president have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with these subsidies gone.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well \u2013 well, what \u2013 what \u2013 if you're \u2013 if you're looking at the \u2013 the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals, what has happened is that, rather than let the states \u2013 the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital, and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away.",
      "In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them money, so really it's the federal government giving them money. And that's why we have been overspending Medicaid by 20 percent since this trick started happening.",
      "And so what we have done is that we have put a haircut on that, but we have also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And so I think this is a prudent reform. It's sound budgetary politics, and I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages.",
      "Thank you very much. Really appreciate your time.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: And if I get it wrong, we will check and we will talk about why I got it wrong, I promise.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: OK.",
      "Thank you. We will have you back. Thank you very much, Kevin.",
      "DIRECTOR KEVIN HASSETT: Thanks, Weijia Jiang.",
      "We now turn to Congressman \u2013 Face the Nation will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi.",
      "Congressman, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI (D-New York): Yes, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett.",
      "You know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history.",
      "You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the Big Beautiful Bill.",
      "It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does is, that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money to do the things that they want to do.",
      "In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know that the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation.",
      "And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the president's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly. On day one, we're going to cut the costs.",
      "Well, costs are not going down. Inflation \u2013 inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able-bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92 percent of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8 percent that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children.",
      "Remember that two-thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine.",
      "And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans, while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans? It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest-income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country.",
      "Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75 percent of what's in this package. That's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25 percent that you don't like?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating.",
      "I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are paying \u2013 providing tax breaks to lower-income folks and hardworking middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class.",
      "I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing \u2013 and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease, tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in \"The Wall Street Journal\" last week saying Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a \u2013 quote \u2013 \"loud wakeup call for Democrats.\"",
      "What lessons do you think your party can learn from \u2013 from his campaign?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist.",
      "And \u2013 but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country.",
      "And, too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school.",
      "So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani, not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem, that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right-wing conservative or a left-wing progressive, should believe that, in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life.",
      "You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.",
      "I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE TOM SUOZZI: It's a combination.",
      "Number one, the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy. They care about immigration. They care about taxes. They care about crime. They care about health care.",
      "But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured. And Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media, like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts.",
      "Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right- leaning, 100 are left-leaning, and of the 100 left-leaning ones, half of them beat the you-know what out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use.",
      "So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers. And we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: All right, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can visit our YouTube page or subscribe to our podcast. It's available on all platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Amazon.",

      "A day ahead of America's 249th birthday, \"CBS EVENING NEWS\" co-anchor John Dickerson met up with filmmaker and historian Ken Burns at Monticello, Virginia, the home of our third president, Thomas Jefferson. Burns has a new film out this November on PBS entitled \"The American Revolution,\" and he gave us a preview.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You call the \u2013 the revolutionary period a civil war.",
      "KEN BURNS (Documentary Filmmaker): It is.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Was that always your conception of the \u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: No.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How did you come to think of it that way?",
      "KEN BURNS: I think because there's no photographs and there's no news reels and they're in, you know, stockings and breaches and powdered wigs there's a sense of distance from them. I think we also are so proud, rightfully, of the power of the big ideas that we \u2013 we just don't want to get into the fact that it was this bloody civil war, patriots against loyalists, disaffected people, native people, enslaved and free people within it, foreign powers that are in \u2013 ultimately engaged in this. This is a big world war by the end.",
      "I think we \u2013 we \u2013 we perhaps are fearful that those big ideas are diminished and they're not in any way. They're, in fact, become even more inspiring, that they emerge from the turmoil.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: How should we think about the Declaration of Independence this period in America in our present day?",
      "KEN BURNS: First of all, I think the American Revolution is the most important event since the birth of Christ in all of world history.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Why?",
      "KEN BURNS: I mean it turned the world upside down, which is the cliche. Before this moment, everyone was a subject. Essentially under the rule of somebody else. We had created in this moment a very brand-new thing called a citizen. And this has had powerful effects. It's going to set in motion revolutions for the next two plus centuries all around the world, all attempting to sort of give a new expression to this idea that all men are created equal, that they're endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights. And that's a big, big deal in world history.",
      "So, what happens here is I suppose you could, you know, miss the point and say it's a quarterfinal between Englishmen, but it is the beginning of something absolutely new in the world. And \u2013 and that is something to celebrate. And to understand, too, that it comes out of so much division that's going on between the states. People in New Hampshire and Georgia are \u2013 they're \u2013 they're from different countries. They believe different things, that you could have the divisions of \u2013 of loyalists and patriots, you could have this \u2013 all the \u2013 the things that are rolling in these colonies and understand that out of that we could still figure out a way to come together.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Americans think they're pretty divided right now. They weren't nearly as divided as they were during the revolutionary period.",
      "KEN BURNS: Here is the simple thing. We're always divided. So, it \u2013 it ebbs and flows a little bit, but we're always have big differences.",
      "You know, Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal is not met with universal approval. The Civil War kills 750,000 Americans we think over the issue of slavery. We have our own revolution. There are lot of periods. The Vietnam period, when we're so particularly divided.",
      "So, I think there's a little bit of chicken little, you know, oh, the sky is falling because now things are always worse now than they ever were. The only \u2013 the reason why historians, and God knows I'm an amateur historian, feel a kind of optimism is because there's something familiar. There's, you know, the Bible says there's nothing new under the sun, human nature essentially doesn't change, and that's true.",
      "What's great about the revolution is, for a moment things actually \u2013 there was something new in the world. And that's the thing that we need to use. That's the leverage we have to bring us back to the ability to speak to one another, to understand how you solve your differences, as opposed to the sort of soup of anger and \u2013 and distrust that seemed to be, you know, everywhere now.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is a citizen's obligation now?",
      "KEN BURNS: A citizen's obligation now is the same as it's ever been. And that's the most important thing. There's a wonderful phrase, a little bit later from the famous words, where Jefferson says, \"all experience has shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable.\" Meaning, we all kind of have gravitated to be under authoritarian rule. You know, the trains running on time, or we get at least this. But we're going to require of you to be a citizen something more. It's got to be active.",
      "The pursuit of happiness is not the acquisition of things in a marketplace of objects, but lifelong learning in a marketplace of ideas. That's what the founders said. To be virtuous, to live a virtuous life, to continually educate yourself is what was required to sustain this republic. And I think that's what we've gotten away from. Everything is sort of all individualized. We're all free agents. We don't realize that freedom, the thing that we tout, is not just what I want, but also that's intention with what we need.",
      "And I think what happens is that when we study these words, we can go back to the sense of newness and freshness that they represented and rededicate ourselves. And that means me, for me, and you for you, to this idea that the pursuit of happiness is about lifelong learning. It's about becoming ever more educated to the responsibility of citizenship. And that's a huge, huge responsibility. Not just to take your feed, not just to go with the flow, not just to get your information that \u2013 that sort of ratifies what you already thought, but to actually explore what my neighbor thinks.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Being an American, as Jefferson saw it, as the founders saw it, was a continuing obligation to engage with its history.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. And \u2013 and this is really important, in order to form the government, they had to reach back through the middle ages, through the dark ages, back to antiquity, to bring up these ideas like virtue and temperance and moderation and all of the things that all of them were looking for.",
      "I mean, the amazing things is, we're here at Thomas Jefferson's house, but we don't have a country without his words, but also we don't have a country without George Washington. And yet we know about all of these men. They're deeply flawed, in many important ways. And I think today, in our binary culture, you know, where everything's a one or a zero, or it's a red state or a blue state, it's my way or the highway, we've forgotten that it's possible to tolerate, as we do among \u2013 with the people we love, their strengths and their weaknesses.",
      "So, heroism is not perfection if we can take an historical view that permits us to see a Jefferson and a Washington in \u2013 in these very complicated understanding of them, then it's possible to then breathe, to have some room to understand who we are now, who we were then, and where we might be, which is, of course, the most important thing. All the anxiety about this present moment is really not so much about the present moment, but about, will we survive.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Can you talk about the genius and brilliance of his words without sitting right in the middle Jefferson's owning of slaves, enslaved people?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. I think this is the important thing. And somehow we've \u2013 we've gotten to the idea that you just don't want to mess with the good stuff and let's just pretend \u2013 pay no attention to that man behind the \u2013 you can't do that. A good story is a good story is a good story. And this is a really good part of the story. It's complicated. It's dark. There are human beings in this house who are owned by a person who has articulated universal rights for everyone. And what's so great is that the vagueness of the words has allowed everybody to plow through and make it their own. Not just here, but all around the stuff.",
      "So \u2013 so, when he says \"pursuit of happiness,\" that may be the key word. When we say a \"more perfect union\" in the Constitution later on, that may be the key word, that this is a process that we're engaged in. And so maybe the \u2013 the poetry, but also the vagueness of the words have opened a door that have \u2013 have \u2013 have allowed women to come through, that have allowed enslaved people to have citizenship, that have expanded in so many different ways. And all around the world, that that's \u2013 this is progress.",
      "And so, I think going back and understanding them for the deep undertow that's present, and sometimes really discomforting undertow about it, is OK. It's \u2013 nothing is diminished. Don't make a Madison Avenue version of - - of \u2013 of our past, but celebrate the grittiness. And I think in this case, the violence of the American Revolution, we do a service to those ideas that we think need to be protected. I mean, with \u2013 this is not ideas that are fixed in amber, you know, this is \u2013 this is \u2013 this is gritty, gritty stuff. People died. Lots of people died fighting for this in \u2013 in just horrific struggles when the main form of killing was a bayonet. That's not fun.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: President Trump has issued an executive in which he says basically history has gotten out of balance as of the American government, either funds it through museums or national parks, and he said instead that \u2013 that this federal role in history should instead \"focus on the greatness of the achievements and the progress of the American people.\"",
      "So, President Trump thinks there's an imbalance in the way we talk about history. How do you see that?",
      "KEN BURNS: I don't see the imbalance. I think we need to celebrate the greatness of the American people. The greatness of the American people comes from telling these compensated stories. And \u2013 and \u2013 and that's a good story is a good story is a good story. That's what you're looking for. You don't want to just say is, otherwise it's just sort of slogans that are \u2013 that are put up on the wall.",
      "We want to feel that we know who Thomas Jefferson is. We need to understand the internal struggles that Abraham Lincoln had. We have to understand what was going through Rosa Parks' mind when she, you know, refused to give up her seat on the bus. This in no way take away from the glory (ph), it makes the story fuller and richer and \u2013 and permits purchase for everyone. You - - you want a \u2013 a history to be complicated because it gives everybody a chance to own or have access to it.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Diversity of voice in storytelling was important to you. That also is under assault at the moment. The president basically is trying to remove all efforts to keep diversity in mind. Is there something that is lost in that?",
      "KEN BURNS: Well, you know, there's a strength in the wagon wheel of all the different spokes into the hub. We're all looking for the hub, whatever the hub is. Meaning, you know, something that pulls us together, that chorus. That's what we're all about.",
      "And so that \u2013 the strength of that wheel has to do with having the spokes and having a multitude of perspective. The impulse for some is to say there's only one perspective. And that's true of many different things. Sometimes say it's got to be only from this perspective. It's got to be Freudian or it's got to be Marxist economic or it's got to be symbolic or it's got to be, you know, post-modern, or whatever the thing is. You don't need that.",

      "JOHN DICKERSON: Going back to this idea of ongoing nourishment of history, part of, go back to the Revolution, to learn who we are now. Do you ever think of this work as an intervention?",
      "People don't re-read The Declaration every Fourth of July, as Thomas Jefferson wanted. People, in your telling, seem to have lost sight of some of the parts of our founding. Maybe we don't even know them because we've been told different kinds of stories. Is this an intervention?",
      "KEN BURNS: No. Intervention imposes between the storyteller, that would be us, and the story we're trying to tell and our audience, some sort of larger, high-fluting purpose. A good story is a good story is a good story. And that's all we're interested in doing.",
      "The Fourth of July is my favorite holiday because you sit there on a blanket, on a field, looking at these fireworks with all of these other people in the dark and you share with them in common that we agree to basically a sentence in a \u2013 in a \u2013 in a document, written, you know, by a Virginian who lived here, you know, 249 years ago. That's really powerful stuff.",
      "So, the fact that it can be misinterpreted by some, this is always going to be the case. Manipulated by others, this will always be the case. Sort of, you know, genuinely embraced but for the wrong reasons, this will always be the case. But we still, we know. We understand that we hold these truths to be self-evident, even though they weren't, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It doesn't get any better of that.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: You've told a lot of your stories on PBS. PBS is under threat.",
      "KEN BURNS: All off them. All of them. All of them (INAUDIBLE).",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Are you worried about the future of PBS?",
      "KEN BURNS: Of course I am. And I've always been worried about it. In the 1990s, I think I testified in the House or the Senate, in appropriations or authorization about the endowments are about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting a half dozen times.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Make the case for PBS.",
      "KEN BURNS: It is the Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world. It's a bottom up. It's the largest network in the country. There's 330 stations. It mostly serves, and this is where the elimination of funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is so shortsighted, it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only they get. They also have not only our good children's and primetime stuff, they have Classroom of the Air continuing education, homeland security, crop reports, weather, emergency information. That we're going to take away? This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left wing thing when this is the place that for 32 years gave William F. Buckley a show. And it's \u2013 I mean it's \u2013 and it's - - that show is, by the way, is still going on and moderated by a conservative.",
      "So, I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. And I couldn't do \u2013 let me personalize it. And I didn't want to. John, I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS. I \u2013 I could go into a streaming service or a premium cable tomorrow and get every one of the millions of dollars it took to do this in one pitch. But they wouldn't give me ten years. They want it in a year or a year and a half. And that's \u2013 I can't do that. Same with Vietnam. Same with the Civil War. Same with jazz. Same with the national parks. Same with, you know, the Roosevelts. All these \u2013 country music. All of those have taken time to incubate. And that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out. Kind of like the national parks, or the Declaration of Independence, applied to the landscape.",
      "These are really good, American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about. That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: As someone who worked so hard on telling the story of slavery and enslaved people in various different ways, what did you learn about slavery in America from working on this?",
      "KEN BURNS: It's so complicated and so interesting. I \u2013 I think the thing that was most striking that's come to me is that it was really clear that our founders, even those founders who owned other human beings, knew that the institution of slavery was indefensible. It's only later in the 19th century that you'll sort of make \u2013 you try to make excuses for why it's OK. And that they're really wrestling with ways. But there are human beings that are owned by other human beings. It's very, very complicated. And you can never say a categorical them about anybody. And that's all we do.",
      "Look, I have \u2013 I have made films about the U.S. for all of my professional life. But I've also made films simultaneously about us. All of the intimacy of that and all the majesty and complexity and contradiction and controversy of the U.S. And the thing I've learned, if I've learned anything, is that there's only \"us.\" There's is no \"them.\" And we're constantly being told there's a them. There is no them.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: If there is only \"us,\" and no \"them,\" it is also a strain in American history, look at them, go get them.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's right. It's the simplest thing. It's the authoritarians' playbook.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: There's a lot of talk about \"them\" these days. Are you hoping to pierce that with this telling of America's beginning?",
      "KEN BURNS: I \u2013 I don't have a conscious desire to do this. This implies a kind of agenda, a kind of a political agenda.",
      "We consciously understand, as we're working on a film, how many \u2013 how much is rhyming in the present and it changes a little bit and changes that. But we don't ever try to put neon signs going, look how much this is so much like today. We just want to let that resonate. And you go, oh my goodness, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, they may have wigs and they may have breaches. They're very much like us.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Because if you put too much of a thumb on the scale, you ruin the story and then you kill the power of the story.",
      "KEN BURNS: That's exactly right. You have to let it tell the story. Our job is to be a good storyteller, period, full stop, end of sentence.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: Which means telling a story well enough that somebody might take a conclusion that's totally different than the one \u2013",
      "KEN BURNS: Oh, absolutely. You \u2013 I \u2013 you know, I remember watching this and going, oh, my God, there's \u2013 there's actually places for all different kinds of people to find purchase. You know, this is a big \u2013 a good story is a big house with lots of different doors. And we tend to go through the front door and think that's it. Somebody may be coming in the side door. Somebody may be coming \u2013 climbing up and \u2013 and breaking in from the second story. However you get in, you're in. And that's all you want is the \u2013 it \u2013 you know, stories are invitations. Like, honey, how was your day, right? It doesn't begin, I backed slowly down the driveway, avoiding the garbage can at the curb. You \u2013 you just edit human experience and that's what we spent the last ten years doing. We were saying, this story of the American founding, our \u2013 our creation myth, is as important a story to get right as anything. And we've spent ten years trying to get it right.",
      "JOHN DICKERSON: What is the difference between the Revolutionary War and the American Revolution?",
      "KEN BURNS: Benjamin Rush, who is the great physician of the time, one of the signors of The Declaration, said that when it was over, that the \u2013 the American war is over, but the American revolution is going on. I think if you accept the idea of pursuit of happiness, if you accept the idea of a \"more perfect union,\" you realize, as we do in our own lives and our own work, in our own relationships, that it's about process. That we're engaged in an ongoing desire to achieve these things. This perfection is what you want to tilt for. It's unattainable, obviously. But if you're not engaged in the active pursuit of perfection, self, relationship, community, country, world, then you're stopped. You're static. And you're not going forward. And I think there's not an American that does not want to go forward.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that \"rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear\" ahead of a key tariff deadline this week, with agreements like the U.K. and Vietnam deals serving as \"guidelines for what might happen\" with other countries.",
      "\"There's going to be quite a bit of news this week, and I think the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized,\" Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "With President Trump's 90-day freeze on sweeping U.S. tariffs set to expire Wednesday, the White House has touted new trade agreements with countries in recent weeks, like China, the U.K. and Vietnam. But there are still questions heading into the week with other deals yet to be announced.",
      "The president on April 2 unveiled a 10% baseline tariff on almost all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of other countries. Days later, as investors appeared spooked, Mr. Trump announced a 90-day pause on most of his new tariffs, keeping the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "Hassett said Sunday that there are a \"whole number\" of deals that U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, along with letters to be sent to countries where \"deals aren't advanced enough\" this week. Mr. Trump told reporters Friday that the U.S. will start sending letters Monday to around a dozen countries.",
      "Though Hassett wouldn't share any details about the countries set to receive the letters, he said the notices could go to both small and large trading partners. Hassett outlined the possibility of getting a deal \"at the last minute\" with the letters, saying \"until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.\"",
      "Asked by senior White House correspondent Weijia Jiang whether the president will extend the pause for some of the most important trading partners if deals don't come together by Wednesday, Hassett said \"the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world.\"",
      "\"There are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back past the deadline, or maybe they won't,\" Hassett said. \"In the end, the president's going to make that judgment.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday that he would likely start the tariffs on Aug. 1. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the president would send the letters, informing countries that \"'if you don't move things along, then, on Aug. 1, you will boomerang back to your April 2 tariff level.'\" Bessent clarified that \"it's not a new deadline,\" but rather \"we are saying this is when it's happening.\"",
      "Hassett touted the trade strategy Sunday, saying \"people are responding to President Trump's potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the U.S., which is creating jobs.\"",
      "\"I think there's a race right now to get activity into the U.S., and in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump,\" Hassett added.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: We turn now to Kevin Hassett. He is the director of the National Economic Council and one of President Trump's top advisors. He's also very popular on that driveway where I'm usually alongside about a dozen reporters. So, Kevin, thank you so much for your time this morning. I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday. As you know, that 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the President announced back in April is set to end. So far, the US has announced a few deals; the UK, Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China. Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah. First, I do have to take- take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story, and Kristi Noem and the President have instructed the federal government to throw everything they've got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place. So, anyway, I'm really heartbroken today to see these stories, and I want you to know that in the White House, everybody is putting every effort they can into helping the people of Texas today. On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And, I think, the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jameson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, and then they're going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go, because the deals aren't advanced enough. And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products, and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the US. At exactly what the numbers will be, will be things that you'll find out in the news this week,.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, you said there are going to be deals. For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the President going to extend this pause?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back the dead- past the deadline, or maybe they want- in the end, the President's going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them. Do you- can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Because- because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening right is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making at the deal, and so we're saying, okay, fine, we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too. Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both. But also, don't forget, that when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday. Less than two weeks ago, the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So, I wonder, you know, if- how can companies plan if the goal posts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals like the UK, and the Vietnam deal that are starting to be, you know, I guess, guidelines for what might happen. But, one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me, is that people are just on-shoring production of the US at a record rate. As we've had record job creation, record capital spending, and this is even ahead of the Big, Beautiful Bill. And so, I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's, you know, potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the US, which is creating jobs, more than 2 million jobs, since he took office, and raising wages. You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so, I think there's a race right now to get activity into the US. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I remember after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there were about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the President. How close, if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah, you'll have- you'll have to get that from Jameson and the President. I think that, you know, we've seen lots of deals that have been finalized by our negotiators, and then the President finds things that could make them better. And so, it's- I'm not going to get ahead of the President on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Okay, thanks, Kevin. We'll look out for that. I want to move now to the One Big, Beautiful Bill that, of course, the President signed into law on Independence Day. You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors in interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit. I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand why there is such a drastic difference between your number and all those others.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy. Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time, when I was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said, and we were criticized soundly, that we would get 3% growth. And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3% growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that if you get 3% growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for. They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But, the thing that disappoints me is that if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3% growth. And then it turns out it's 1.5% growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss? These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table, said we're going to get that 3% growth, and then we got it right last time, and we believe we're going to get it right this time. But, if you think that 1.8% growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But, there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that if we don't pass the bill, that it's the biggest tax hike in history. And with that big tax hike, that of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4% drop in GDP and lose 9 million jobs. If we had a 4% drop in GDP and we lost 9 million jobs, what would happen to the deficit? And so, I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist at Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years, and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I want to talk too, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the President disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about, and that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, yeah. Let's- let's unbundle that a little bit. Because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing? So, what we're doing is we're asking for a work requirement. But, the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work, or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so, the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance, doesn't make a lot of sense to us. And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers, they say that people are going to lose insurance. About 5 million of those are people who have other insurance. They're people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured. And so, the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all. But, on the other side, go back to 2017 when we had work requirements for Obamacare, they said that we lose about 4 million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up. It went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job. And we've got a Big, Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance, and the CBO is just not accounting for that. And again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20%. They should look back at all the things they got wrong, and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future, and to do a better job. And if they do that, we'll take them more seriously. But right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they've done so wrong, and wrong for so long. Even back- if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid, and so on. And so, their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could, kind of, roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, better history, track record than CBO.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too? That the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance. That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud, and abuse that I know you and the President have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with the subsidies gone.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well- well, if you're- if you're looking at the- the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals. What has happened is that, rather than let the states- the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away. In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them the money, so really, it's the federal government giving them the money. And that's why we've been overspending Medicaid by 20% since this trick started happening. And so, what we've done is that we've put a haircut on that. But, we've also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick. So, I think this is a prudent form. It's sound budgetary politics. And I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages. Thank you very much. Really appreciate --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: - And if I get it wrong, we'll check, and we'll talk about why I got it wrong. I promise.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Thank you. We'll have you back. Thank you very much, Kevin.",

      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett- you know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history. You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the 'big, beautiful bill.' It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does, is that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money, to do the things that they want to do. In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act- Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation. And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the President's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly on day one, we're going to cut the costs. Well, costs are not going down, inflation- inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92% of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8% that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children. Remember that two thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine. And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans. It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country. Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75% of what's in this package, that's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25% that you don't like?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating. I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are providing tax breaks to lower income folks and hard working middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class. I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing- and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease- tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week saying, Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a quote, 'loud wake up call for Democrats.' What lessons do you think your party can learn from- from his campaign?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist. And- but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country. And too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school. So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right wing conservative or a left wing progressive, should believe that in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life. You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that 'Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.' I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: It's a combination. Number- the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy, they care about immigration, they care about taxes, they care about crime, they care about health care. But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured, and Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts. Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right leaning. 100 are left leaning. And of the 100 left leaning ones, half of them beat the, you know what, out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use. So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers, and we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Alright, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

      "Filmmaker Ken Burns said it's \"shortsighted\" to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting as public media has become a target of the White House in recent months.",
      "\"This seems foolhardy and seems misguided, mainly because there is a perception among a handful of people that this is somehow a blue or a left-wing thing,\" Burns said of cutting funds to PBS in an interview that aired Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in May instructing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private nonprofit that serves as the steward of the funding to public media, to cease federal funding for PBS and NPR. Then in June, the House approved a request from the White House to claw back $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The package is expected to be taken up by the Senate in the coming weeks as the White House has targeted the public media entities, claiming they have \"spread radical, woke propaganda disguised as 'news.'\"",
      "Burns, whose upcoming film \"The American Revolution\" is expected to air on PBS in November and has had more than 40 documentaries on the public broadcaster, told \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson that he's worried about PBS' future, noting that he's \"always been worried about it.\"",
      "The filmmaker recalled testifying before congressional committees in the 1990s about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. He likened PBS to the \"Declaration of Independence applied to the communications world,\" saying it's \"bottom up.\"",
      "The funding cuts are \"shortsighted,\" Burns said, because \"it mainly serves rural areas in which the PBS signal may be the only signal they get.\"",
      "Burns stressed that PBS has children's programming, continuing education, information on homeland security, crop reports and weather emergencies, saying, \"that, we're going to take away?\"",
      "\"I just think that maybe we're throwing the baby out with the bath water,\" Burns said.",
      "The filmmaker also noted that his films wouldn't be possible without PBS, saying he wouldn't be afforded the time it takes to produce his films elsewhere.",
      "\"I couldn't do any of the films I've done without them being on PBS,\" Burns said, noting that streaming services or cable \"wouldn't give me 10 years.\"",
      "Of his work, Burns said many of the projects have \"taken time to incubate, and that has been under the system that has one foot tentatively in the marketplace and the other proudly out, kind of like the National Parks or the Declaration of Independence applied to the landscape.\"",
      "\"These are really good American institutions that represent everybody from the bottom up, which is what it's always about,\" Burns said. \"That's the essence of what Thomas Jefferson was talking about.\"",

    "story": [
      "A\u00a090-day freeze\u00a0on sweeping U.S. tariffs is set to expire on July 9, sowing economic uncertainty as the Trump administration works to revamp the terms of global trade.",
      "The stakes for millions of U.S. consumers and businesses are high. Economists warn that the barrage of import duties announced on April 2, which President Trump called \"Liberation Day,\" could trigger another bout of inflation, put smaller companies out of businesses and dent financial markets.",
      "As next week's deadline approaches, the Trump administration has touted new trade agreements with countries including China, the U.K. and\u00a0Vietnam, while the status of other pacts remains under wraps. Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that the the U.S. is likely to start informing some countries on Friday what tariffs their exports will face. Earlier in the week, he said doesn't plan to extend the July 9 deadline, leaving little time to clinch bilateral deals with dozens of other countries.",
      "Under the April 2 tariffs, imports from some nations would only face a 10% universal tariff, while some Asian nations, such as Cambodia, would also be subject to duties of 49%. If the new tariffs take effect next week, country-specific rates would be added to the baseline 10% charge on all U.S. imports.",
      "That 10% duty has been in effect since early April, while the so-called reciprocal rates have largely been temporarily suspended. Additionally, many goods from Canada and Mexico have been exempted from 25% tariffs under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement.",
      "Chinese goods, which were temporarily subject to levies of as high as 145%, are currently subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs.",
      "If the U.S. fails to arrange trade deals with some nations by the deadline, country-specific tariffs would take effect after midnight on July 9, substantially hiking duties on billions of dollar in foreign imports from all corners of the globe.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a question about whether it could announce more trade deals by the July 9 deadline.",
      "Kicking the can?",
      "Given the complexity of trade deals, some experts think the U.S. is likely to extend the tariff\u00a0pause for some nations.",
      "\"It can take a lot more time [than 90 days] to truly iron these things out,\" Clark Packard, a trade policy expert and research fellow at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Countries that Trump administration officials see as negotiating in good faith could be given a longer runway, while tariffs are likely to rise on July as scheduled for nations viewed as less compliant, he added.",
      "\"I think countries the administration believes are not bending at the knee or kissing the ring are likely going to face tariff snapbacks,\" Packard said.",
      "Although imposing sharply higher tariffs on dozens of countries could scare some investors and fuel concerns about higher prices in the U.S., extending the tariff freeze would prolong uncertainty for millions of U.S. businesses.",
      "\"The threat of tariffs, and this uncertainty, causes capital to sit on the sidelines. You cannot plan out a year from now if you if you can't even figure out what your costs are going to be in a week,\" Packard said. \"All of that causes uncertainty, and that's the enemy of investment and broader economic growth, which are the kinds of things we want in the economy.\"",
      "3 buckets",
      "Patrick Childress, an international trade police attorney at law firm Holland & Knight, expects the countries subject to higher U.S. tariffs to fall into three different broad categories as the clock strikes on July 9.",
      "First, he thinks \"a modest number\" of trade agreements will be finalized before the deadline. Under the new U.S. deal with Vietnam, for example, Mr. Trump said the country's imports would be subject to levies of 20%, plus a 40% tariff on goods that pass through Vietnam from other countries. In return, Vietnam will allow the U.S. to sell products in the country tariff-free, Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has also announced the framework of what he called a \"breakthrough\"\u00a0deal with the U.K. that includes \"billions of dollars of increased market access for American exports.\" Mr. Trump added that the under the terms of the deal, the U.K. would \"reduce or eliminate\" numerous nontariff barriers. A broad agreement with China has also been reached, according to both nations.",
      "A number of other nations are likely to fall into a second category in which the U.S. keeps a 10% baseline tariff in place as trade talks continue, Childress said.",
      "A third group of U.S. trading partners, having either failed to nail down a trade deal or viewed as uncooperative by American trade officials, will be hit with sharply higher tariffs as of 12:01 a.m. on July 9.",
      "\"We don't know which trading partners will fall into which of the three buckets, or how many trading partners will end up in each of three groups,\" Childress said.",
      "What could happen next",
      "\"If no action is taken by the executive, the higher rates automatically go into effect,\" David Murphy, a customs and trade attorney with law firm GDLSK, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If he makes deals like he's done with the U.K., that pulls them out of the whole mess \u2014 their deal stands. So if he comes up with other deals and announces them before July 9, they are in that bucket as well.\"",
      "Countries that fail to come to terms with the Trump administration face potentially large tariff increases. For example, Mr. Trump has threatened to hit EU members with a 50% flat tariff.",
      "\"If this happens, the EU will likely feel compelled to respond in kind, potentially sparking a full trade war and market instability,\" analysts with investment adviser Gavekal said in a report.",
      "Because trade policy experts don't expect all, or even most, deals to be finalized by Mr. Trump's deadline, uncertainty will likely persist, they say.",
      "\"The most likely outcome seems to be some combination of very limited agreements which would allow the U.S. to grant further extensions without losing face,\" analysts with Capital Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report. \"Indeed, Trump has stated that a longer pause would be 'no big deal'. But given his unpredictability, we wouldn't rule out the possibility that some countries face Liberation Day tariffs from next week.\"",
      "Some experts also think a number of countries are unlikely to fold to U.S. pressure regardless of Mr. Trump's self-imposed deadline. That includes the European Union's 27-member nations, which account for a quarter of all U.S. exports, giving them significant leverage.",
      "Meanwhile, much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda could end up in tatters after the U.S. Court of International Trade in May ruled that most of his tariffs were illegal. Although a federal appeals count in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked, a final ruling is pending.",

      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

    "summary": "From the Clotilda to the Titanic, archaeologist James Delgado shares insights from his 50-year career.",
    "story": [
      "Renowned underwater archaeologist James Delgado appeared on \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday to discuss his new book, \"The Great Museum of the Sea,\" and reflect on more than 50 years of searching for historic shipwrecks around the world.",
      "Delgado, who has investigated more than 100 shipwrecks globally, gained international attention in 2019 when he discovered the Clotilda, the last known slave ship to arrive in the United States. The discovery was later featured in a \"60 Minutes\" segment with Anderson Cooper.",
      "The archaeologist's fascination with shipwrecks began in childhood while growing up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he learned about ships from the 1849 Gold Rush. He said locating shipwrecks requires extensive preparation.",
      "\"It takes a team. And that team includes oceanographers, people that understand currents. We're also looking at old records and charts. You're also trying to understand the forensics of it,\" he said.",
      "The process involves analyzing factors like ship speed and sailing patterns. Once located, the wrecks often don't match popular expectations.",
      "\"We have great images that people think of as shipwrecks, but there are a pile of rockets and timber and anchor, and then you go, all right, what exactly am I looking at here,\" he said.",
      "In his book, Delgado describes the sea as \"the largest museum on Earth\" and argues that every shipwreck has a story to tell.",
      "\"I think the most important thing for people to remember about shipwrecks is that it's okay for them to have different meanings,\" Delgado said. \"Some people like them because they inspire you with the stories of bravery. Others are tragic and sad. For some, they're the graves of family. But for others, they're a great opportunity to dive and to explore.\"",
      "The archaeologist has also explored the Titanic, describing the experience as overwhelming despite the ship's fame.",
      "\"Nothing prepares you for seeing 'Titanic,'\" he said.",
      "After a 2.5-hour descent in a Russian submersible, with pressure so intense that \"a regular styrofoam coffee cup gets squeezed down\" when strapped to the outside, Delgado said the anticipation suddenly disappeared when the ship appeared.",
      "\"There it was looming out of the darkness,\" he recalled. \"This massive hull rising twice as high as the ceiling here. Still painted but streaked with rust and rusticles that are orange and yellow and red. And then a porthole that's open and another closed.\"",
      "Delgado described one particularly eerie moment: \"One of the spookiest moments \u2014 because 'Titanic' is a ship of the dead \u2014 is when I first looked through the porthole, 2.5 miles down, the lights \u2014 I could see a face looking back at me in the porthole. It was my own reflection.\"",
      "He reflected on the ship's enduring power: \"This ship sitting on the bottom ruined and deteriorating still is the stage upon which some of the most powerful drama played out that we all know about with the shipwreck. And you're there.\"",
      "\"The Great Museum of the Sea\" is available wherever books are sold.",

    "published": "Wed, 02 Jul 2025 14:17:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The move is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from the New World screwworm fly, which could devastate its beef industry and even kill household pets.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. government is preparing to breed billions of flies and dump them out of airplanes over Mexico and southern Texas to fight a flesh-eating maggot.",
      "That sounds like the plot of a horror movie, but it is part of the government's plans for protecting the U.S. from a bug that could devastate its beef industry, decimate wildlife and even kill household pets. This weird science has worked well before.",
      "\"It's an exceptionally good technology,\" said Edwin Burgess, an assistant professor at the University of Florida who studies parasites in animals, particularly livestock. \"It's an all-time great in terms of translating science to solve some kind of large problem.\"",
      "The targeted pest is the flesh-eating larva of\u00a0the New World Screwworm fly.\u00a0The U.S. Department of Agriculture plans to ramp up the breeding and distribution of adult male flies \u2014 sterilizing them with radiation before releasing them. They mate with females in the wild, and the eggs laid by the female aren't fertilized and don't hatch. There are fewer larvae, and over time, the fly population dies out.",
      "It is more effective and environmentally friendly than spraying the pest into oblivion, and it is how the U.S. and other nations north of Panama eradicated the same pest decades ago. Sterile flies from a factory in Panama kept the flies contained there for years, but the pest appeared in southern Mexico late last year.",
      "The USDA expects a new screwworm fly factory to be up and running in southern Mexico by July 2026. It plans to open a fly distribution center in southern Texas by the end of the year so that it can import and distribute flies from Panama if necessary.",
      "The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "Threats to the beef industry",
      "Most fly larvae feed on dead flesh, making the New World screwworm fly and its Old World counterpart in Asia and Africa outliers \u2014 and for the American beef industry, a serious threat. Females lay their eggs in wounds and, sometimes, exposed mucus.",
      "\"A thousand-pound bovine can be dead from this in two weeks,\" said Michael Bailey, president elect of the American Veterinary Medicine Association.",
      "Veterinarians have effective treatments for infested animals, but an infestation can still be unpleasant \u2014 and cripple an animal with pain.",
      "Don Hineman, a retired western Kansas rancher, recalled infected cattle as a youngster on his family's farm.",
      "\"It smelled nasty,\" he said. \"Like rotting meat.\"",
      "Scientists plan to use the fly's biology against it",
      "The New World screwworm fly is a tropical species, unable to survive Midwestern or Great Plains winters, so it was a seasonal scourge. Still, the U.S. and Mexico bred and released more than 94 billion sterile flies from 1962 through 1975 to eradicate the pest, according to the USDA.",
      "The numbers need to be large enough that females in the wild can't help but hook up with sterile males for mating.",
      "One biological trait gives fly fighters a crucial wing up: Females mate only once in their weekslong adult lives.",
      "Why does the U.S. want to breed more flies?",
      "Alarmed about the fly's migration north, the U.S. temporarily closed its southern border in May to imports of live cattle, horses and bison and it won't be fully open again at least until mid-September.",
      "But female flies can lay their eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal, and that includes humans.",
      "Decades ago, the U.S. had fly factories in Florida and Texas, but they closed as the pest was eradicated.",
      "The Panama fly factory can breed up to 117 million a week, but the USDA wants the capacity to breed at least 400 million a week. It plans to spend $8.5 million on the Texas site and $21 million to convert a facility in southern Mexico for breeding sterile fruit flies into one for screwworm flies.",
      "Raising hundreds of millions of flies",
      "In one sense, raising a large colony of flies is relatively easy, said Cassandra Olds, an assistant professor of entomology at Kansas State University.",
      "But, she added, \"You've got to give the female the cues that she needs to lay her eggs, and then the larvae have to have enough nutrients.\"",
      "Fly factories once fed larvae horse meat and honey and then moved to a mix of dried eggs and either honey or molasses, according to past USDA research. Later, the Panama factory used a mix that included egg powder and red blood cells and plasma from cattle.",
      "In the wild, larvae ready for the equivalent of a butterfly's cocoon stage drop off their hosts and onto the ground, burrow just below the surface and grow to adulthood inside a protective casing making them resemble a dark brown Tic Tac mint. In the Panama factory, workers drop them into trays of sawdust.",
      "Security is an issue. Sonja Swiger, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Extension Service, said a breeding facility must prevent any fertile adults kept for breeding stock from escaping.",
      "Risks associated with dropping flies from an airplane",
      "Dropping flies from the air can be dangerous. Last month, a plane freeing sterile flies crashed near Mexico's border with Guatemala, killing three people.",
      "In test runs in the 1950s, according to the USDA, scientists put the flies in paper cups and then dropped the cups out of planes using special chutes. Later, they loaded them into boxes with a machine known as a \"Whiz Packer.\"",
      "The method is still much the same: Light planes with crates of flies drop those crates.",
      "Burgess called the development of sterile fly breeding and distribution in the 1950s and 1960s one of the USDA's \"crowning achievements.\"",
      "Some agriculture officials argue now that new factories shouldn't be shuttered after another successful fight.",
      "\"Something we think we have complete control over \u2014 and we have declared a triumph and victory over \u2014 can always rear its ugly head again,\" Burgess said.",

    "story": [
      "A satellite program that has historically been a key source of weather forecasting data will be discontinued by July 31, as the United States enters peak hurricane season, according to the already resource-strapped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "The federal agency, which includes the National Weather Service, initially said last week that it was going to lose access to the satellite data by June 30. But in an update\u00a0posted online on Monday, NOAA said the deadline to decommission the satellite system was pushed to July 31, at the request of a top official at NASA.",
      "Operated by the U.S. Department of Defense, the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program has since the 1960s collected environmental information each day from satellites orbiting Earth, in order to provide real-time details about conditions in the atmosphere and oceans to the military. The data was made available to weather scientists for traditional forecasting purposes, after being processed by a branch of the Navy that focuses on meteorology and oceanography.",
      "Starting Aug. 1, that naval branch will no longer process or upload satellite data to the computing interface where meteorologists previously accessed it, according to NOAA.",
      "In an email that the agency reposted online, the deputy director of its Office of Satellite and Product Operations said the Navy decided to implement that change in efforts \"to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk\" but would continue to distribute the data through the end of next month. A Navy spokesperson told CBS News in an email that it is \"discontinuing contributions\" to the satellite program \"given the program no longer meets our information technology modernization requirements.\"",
      "NOAA spokesperson Kim Doster called it a \"routine process of data rotation and replacement\" in a statement to CBS News on Monday, adding that remaining data sources remaining \"are fully capable of providing a complete suite of cutting-edge data and models that ensure the gold-standard weather forecasting the American people deserve.\"",
      "\"The DMSP is a single dataset in a robust suite of hurricane forecasting and modeling tools in the NWS portfolio,\" said Doster, citing several other satellites that feed into the National Weather Service's forecasting models, including one launched recently that,\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. Space Force, \"advances weather monitoring.\"",
      "The data cutoff from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program comes after NOAA lost a substantial chunk of its staff to layoffs and buyouts earlier this year, stemming from President Trump's initiative to reduce government spending in part by shrinking the federal workforce.",
      "Former NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad, who served in that role during the Biden administration, told CBS News in an email that \"there's no logical explanation\" for the cutoff, \"other than some downstream benefit to the private sector\" \u2014 which would align with goals outlined in Project 2025 to move toward privatizing NOAA and the Weather Service. Losing that data puts the agency's current capabilities at risk, Spinrad said, especially during hurricane season.",
      "\"NWS is working feverishly to start using other data from a satellite DoD launched last year,\" he added. \"This is ill-timed, poorly planned, and dangerous.\"",
      "Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30, and NOAA forecasters said in May that they expected this one to be more active than an average year. The season typically reaches its \"peak,\" its most active period, around August and September.",

His death at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles was confirmed by the U.S. Bureau of Prisons on June 24, but authorities have not disclosed the cause. The death of the 32-year-old has shuttered the federal criminal prosecution and thickens the cloud of mystery surrounding the May 17 bombing attack at the American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic in Palm Springs, California.",
      "The alleged bomber and Park's alleged co-conspirator, 25-year-old Guy Bartkus, was killed in the bombing, the FBI said. Four people were injured in the explosion.",
      "Park was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate to be used by Bartkus. He was charged with Attempting to Provide Material Support to Terrorists, Conspiracy to manufacture unregistered destructive devices and aiding and abetting the manufacture of unregistered destructive devices.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Park and Bartkus shared extremist views. In a charging document, the Justice Department said, \"Bartkus's attack was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best.\"",
      "Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said Bartkus had \"nihilistic ideations\" and investigators believe he was attempting to livestream the bombing.",
      "Park's death closes the only prosecution in the fertility clinic bombing. It also comes amid questions about the conditions at the L.A. Metropolitan Detention Center. The prison is where people charged with a crime are held prior to and during court proceedings. It also holds those serving short sentences.",
      "Immigration lawyers in California told CBS News last month that they have been receiving increasing calls about unmet medical needs at the detention center. One lawyer, who chose not to identify herself because she has clients inside the detention center, said there are reports of \"inhumane\" conditions, including food shortages, cramped confinement, freezing temperatures and environments that are a \"ticking-time bomb.\"",
      "A 2024 report by the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General raised concerns about the Bureau of Prisons' response to inmate emergencies.",
      "\"We found significant shortcomings in BOP staff's emergency responses to nearly half of the inmate deaths we reviewed,\" the report said. \"These shortcomings ranged from a lack of urgency in responding, failure to bring or use appropriate emergency equipment, unclear radio communications, and issues with naloxone administration in opioid overdose cases.\"",
      "Responding to the inspector general's findings, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told CBS News: \"Any unexpected death of an inmate is tragic.",
      "\"As noted in the Inspector General's report, we have already taken many steps to mitigate these deaths, and we welcome Inspector General's recommendations as a way to further our efforts. We will continue to work with the Office of Inspector General,\" the spokesperson said.",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:15:23 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump pushed to eliminate taxes on Social Security. Does his \"one big, beautiful bill\" deliver?",
    "story": [
      "As Congress was approving President Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\" on Thursday, the Social Security Administration touted the legislation by stating that it \"eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries.\"",
      "That claim, which echoes\u00a0previous promises by Mr. Trump to remove taxes on Social Security, may have come as welcome news for the millions of older and disabled people who depend on the program for income. So does the bill deliver? Not entirely.",
      "In a press release, the SSA said that the tax and spending package, which the president is set to sign into law on Friday, \"ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits.\"",
      "That figure draws on a June\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House's Council of Economic Advisers that said 88% of seniors \u2014 or 51.4 million people \u2014 on Social Security will pay no tax on their payments under the measure because their deductions would exceed their taxable benefits. More than 70 million Americans collect Social Security benefits, according to the SSA.",
      "The bill \"includes the largest tax break in American history for our nation's seniors,\" CEA said, adding that \"the deductions ensure that seniors who earned their Social Security through years of hard work get more money back in their pockets.\"",
      "Yet while it's true that the bill offers fresh tax relief for some people on Social Security, it is misleading to suggest that the measure does away with taxes on Social Security benefits, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch. Rather, the bill offers relief by creating a new \"bonus\" tax deduction for beneficiaries.",
      "\"While the deduction does provide some relief for seniors, it's far from completely repealing the tax on their benefits,\" Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank, told The Associated Press this week ahead of Congress approving the bill.",
      "The Social Security Administration did not respond to a request for comment. The White House declined to comment.",
      "How does the \"big, beautiful bill\" impact Social Security?",
      "The bill doesn't eliminate taxes on Social Security, but rather introduces a temporary deduction that beneficiaries can claim to lower their federal income tax. Notably, that deduction applies to all of a senior's income \u2014 not just to Social Security benefits.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS MoneyWatch the bill doesn't change the taxation of Social Security benefits. Eliminating taxes on Social Security under the bill was impossible because of a congressional restriction (dubbed the Byrd Rule\u00a0after late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd) that limits what the Senate can include in a reconciliation bill like the Republican budget measure.",
      "What the bill does do is provide a temporary tax deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors aged 65 and older. The tax break is available to people with an adjusted gross incomes of $75,000 or less and $150,000 or less for couples filing jointly. The deduction is set to expire at the end of 2028.",
      "\"Each spouse can take the deduction, for a total of $12,000, if both are 65-plus,\" AARP explains in its analysis of the budget bill. The deduction phases out for people who earn above those amounts.",
      "Social Security recipients under 65 and people above the specified income thresholds are ineligible to claim the new tax deduction. It also won't benefit the many low-income seniors who already pay no federal income tax because they earn too little.",
      "\"Boosting the amount that you get to write off when you already get to write off everything does not help you at all,\" Kogan said.",
      "The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan policy research group, said in a June\u00a0report\u00a0that exempting Social Security benefits from taxation would not change the after-tax income for the bottom 20% of taxpayers, noting that \"those taxpayers are already exempt from taxation on their Social Security benefits.\"",
      "The biggest beneficiaries of the bill will be higher-income seniors, said Martha Shedden, president and co-founder of the National Association of Registered Social Security Analysts, which focuses on Social Security education.",
      "\"The people who benefit by definition have to be richer, and the people who benefit the most are the richest people, before the tax cut phases out,\" Kogan added.",
      "The tax cut is fully phased out for individuals making $175,000 and for couples making $250,000.",
      "More pressure on Social Security?",
      "Providing a temporary tax deduction is likely to help some Social Security recipients, but it could also worsen the retirement program's fragile financial state, Kogan said. Social Security is on track to\u00a0deplete its trust fund by 2034 if Congress does not take action.",
      "\"We already have a problem of not enough money going into the trust fund. This bill makes even less money go into the trust fund,\" he said.",
      "The Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies fiscal issues, estimates that eliminating income taxes on Social Security benefits would lower federal revenue by $1.5 trillion over 10 years and increase the federal debt by 7%\u00a0 by 2054.",
      "As the debate continues over how to shore up Social Security while offering tax relief to older Americans, one thing is clear, and perhaps politically unpalatable: cutting benefits. According to a AARP-funded survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance released in January, 85% of Americans think benefits should not be reduced, or that they should be increased, even if it means raising taxes on some or all Americans.",
      "\"Virtually all Americans want their Social Security benefits to be preserved and are willing to do what it takes to ensure the program continues to provide meaningful support for future generations,\" said AARP Chief Public Policy Officer Deb Whitman in a statement after the survey was released.",

      "Mr. Trump posted\u00a0two nearly identical letters, addressed to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung, on his Truth Social media platform outlining the new tariffs. A 90-day freeze on country-specific U.S. tariffs on dozens of nations, including Japan and South Korea, is scheduled to expire on July 9.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday afternoon also announced separate tariffs on an additional five trade partners. Myanmar and Laos both face a 40% tariff rate; South Africa imports will be subject to 30% duties; and goods from both Malaysia and Kazakhstan will be taxed at 25%, Mr. Trump said in letters posted on Truth Social. Those tariffs are scheduled to kick in August 1 as well.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a press briefing Monday that Mr. Trump is set to sign an executive order extending the July 9 tariff freeze. The order delays the deadline to \"August 1 so the reciprocal tariff rate, or these new rates that will be provided in this correspondence to these foreign leaders, will be going out the door within the next month,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt added that Mr. Trump plans to send tariff letters to \"approximately 12 other countries\" informing them of new U.S. levies on their goods. She did not indicate when the notices will be sent out, but said Mr. Trump will post them on Truth Social \"so you can enjoy them yourself.\"",
      "Trump is also expected to announce more deals with U.S. trade partners before the beginning of August, she said.",
      "Mr. Trump said in each memo that the letter \"demonstrates the strength and commitment of our Trading Relationship,\" and that \"we invite you to participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United States.\"",
      "The 25% levies apply to \"any and all Japanese products sent into the United States, separate from all Sectoral Tariffs,\" Mr. Trump added in his letter to Japan's Ishiba. He also warned that if either South Korea or Japan raises tariffs on the U.S., the Trump administration will reciprocate by adding that figure to the 25% baseline rate.",
      "The 25% tariff is in line with the so-called \"reciprocal\" rates Mr. Trump said South Korea and Japan would each face when he unveiled country-specific duties on April 2. At the time, the Trump administration said it would impose tariffs of 24% and 25% on imports from Japan and South Korea, respectively.",
      "25% tariff would bog down trade",
      "Trade policy expert Barry Appleton, co-director of the Center for International Law at New York Law School, told CBS MoneyWatch that Monday's announcements \"are simply indications that he is making them pay full admission price to access the U.S. market.\"",
      "\"At 25%, it is possible, but challenging, to trade with Japan and Korea. This rate was carefully set at the higher side of the spectrum. In essence trade with the U.S. now is a pay to play proposition for Japan, Korea and likely others to come,\" he said.",
      "Appleton added that the country-specific rates announced Monday do not bode well for other nations looking to strike deals with the U.S., including EU countries, Canada and Switzerland.",
      "Economists warn that wide-ranging U.S. tariffs on trading partners could spark another bout of inflation and hinder economic growth, while global financial markets have heaved at the prospect of significantly higher trading costs.",

      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area say water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "Death toll is expected to rise as campers remain missing",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said that there were dozens of people unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, at least 75 people, including 27 children, died, officials said Monday morning. Fatalities in nearby counties brought the total number of deaths to at least 95 as of Monday afternoon.",
      "Ten girls and a counselor were still unaccounted for at Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river.",
      "Three girls from Dallas\u00a0\u2014 8-year-olds Hadley Hanna and Eloise Peck and 9-year-old Lila Bonner \u2014 were identified as missing Camp Mystic campers. Bonner's family confirmed to\u00a0CBS Texas\u00a0on Saturday that she was among the children confirmed dead and Peck's family on Sunday posted a note at their home saying she had died as well.",
      "Two sisters from Dallas\u00a0\u2014 13-year-old Blair Harber and 11-year-old Brooke Harber \u2014 were also confirmed dead by the St. Rita Catholic Community church in Dallas.",
      "Camp Mystic's owner and director Dick Eastland died while trying to save girls at the camp, according to local media reports. The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Eastland.",
      "For past campers, the tragedy turned happy memories into grief.",
      "Beyond the Camp Mystic campers unaccounted for, the number of missing from other nearby campgrounds and across the region had not been released.",
      "\"We don't even want to begin to estimate at this time,\" Kerrville City Manager Dalton Rice said Saturday, citing the likely influx of visitors during the July Fourth holiday.",
      "Officials face scrutiny over flash flood warnings",
      "Survivors have described the floods as a \"pitch black wall of death\" and said they received no emergency warnings.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \"nobody saw this coming.\" Various officials have referred to it as a \"100-year-flood,\" meaning that the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don't always account for human-caused climate change. Though it's hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say that a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kelly said authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods. \"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Kerr county officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost.",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "Search for victims and monumental cleanup",
      "With more rain on the way, the risk of life-threatening flooding was still high in central Texas on Monday even as crews search urgently for the missing. Volunteers, search dogs and drones have joined the effort \u2014 with some rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain filled with snakes.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving more than 200 people, as dramatic\u00a0video\u00a0showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville, while dark water covered the ground.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It's going to be a long time before we're ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",
      "Other massive flooding events have driven residents and business owners to give up, including in areas struck last year by Hurricane Helene.",
      "President Donald Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County and said he would likely visit Friday: \"I would have done it today, but we'd just be in their way.\"",
      "\"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible,\" he told reporters.",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday mass, saying, \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe river in Texas in the United States.\"",

      "The first weather emergency alert sent by the National Weather Service with urgent language instructing people to \"seek higher ground now\" was sent at 4:03 a.m. CT, according to CBS News review of every alert sent to cellphones from July 2 to July 5. At this point the river was rising, roughly 1.74 feet high. But there were no alerts sent to cellphones in the area by Kerr or Bandera local government officials. The only information the public could rely on was National Weather Service announcements that were sent in the middle of the night and early morning.",
      "During the most critical hours \u2014 from 5 a.m. until nearly 7 a.m. CT, when the river rose from 1.82 feet to 34.29 feet because of the 5-10 inches of rain that had fallen \u2014 the National Weather Service sent out three critical cellphone messages to Kerr County, which includes Camp Mystic, saying \"This is a PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION. SEEK HIGHER GROUND NOW!\"",
      "Some Kerrville residents told CBS News they received no phone warnings before the flood hit, or that they don't pay much attention to the weather warnings they do receive.",
      "\"We get alerts regularly about flash flood warnings,\" Kerrville resident Heidi Easton told CBS News. \"I kind of just swipe \u2026 because it usually doesn't mean much.\"",
      "The Integrated Public Alert Warning System, known as IPAWS, is software used to send emergency text alerts to cellphones, but none were initiated by Kerr County, according to CBS News' analysis. The only notifications sent to the public were the ones from the National Weather Service.",
      "Meteorologists defend National Weather Service forecasts",
      "Local officials have claimed the forecasts were not accurate, and the most extreme rainfall totals did exceed what was predicted. But many experts have come out and defended the work of the National Weather Service.",
      "\"There have been claims that NOAA/NWS did not foresee catastrophic TX floods--but that's simply not true,\" said climate scientist Daniel Swain of UCLA in a social media post, \"This was undoubtedly an extreme event, but messaging rapidly escalated beginning ~12 hrs prior.\"",
      "Concerns about staffing and budget cuts at the National Weather Service have been in the news since the Trump administration took office in January.",
      "The San Antonio and San Angelo weather forecasts offices, which issued warnings for the affected areas, are currently operating with 23 meteorologists on staff, according to union officials for the National Weather Service. The two offices have a combined total of 10 vacancies, including a warning coordination meteorologist in San Antonio, leaving them slightly short of being fully staffed. The warning coordination meteorologist plays a crucial role in coordinating with local officials about severe weather emergencies.",
      "Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott was asked about concerns over staffing levels and budget cuts at the National Weather Service during a Sunday press conference and said he \"knows nothing\" about its staffing, although he said he did speak to Kristi Noem, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, about budgeting for weather offices. Abbott said there are plans to hold a special session of the Texas State Legislature to investigate what happened in Kerrville.",
      "When asked if the federal government should hire back more meteorologists, Mr. Trump said, \"I really wouldn't, I think not.\" He spoke to reporters on Sunday about the Texas flooding, saying, \"Nobody expected it, nobody saw it.\"",
      "But the White House defended the work of the National Weather Service to CBS News and shared numerous reports of statements from other meteorologists, including Jason Runyon, who works for the National Weather Service and said that its office in New Braunfels, which contributes forecasts for Austin, San Antonio and other areas affected by the flooding, had extra staff on duty during the storms.",
      "\"The National Weather Service weather forecasts offices in San Angelo and San Antonio got the forecast right,\" said Tom Fahy, the legislative director for the National Weather Service Employees Organization, the union that represents weather service workers. \"The forecasters did their jobs.\"",
      "But Fahy has taken issue with some budget cuts enacted by this administration. He told CBS News that reduced funding for critical weather programs focused on the last level of warnings disseminated to the public are to blame for much of what happened in Texas.",
      "\"Tragically, people will die\" if funding and increased staffing of meteorologists and other staff are not restored, he told CBS News.",
      "Some of the programs Fahy cited that have been suspended relate to coordinating between NWS meteorologists and state, local and county emergency management officials and public safety officers. He also raised concern about cuts to research labs that are responsible for studying catastrophic weather events to better understand why they happen and how the public can be better prepared for them.",
      "\"This comes down to the warnings and more staff,\" Fahy told CBS News, \"This is why we do this training stuff, and that's why funding has to be restored to strengthen collaborative exercises with the emergency management community to prevent tragedies like this weekend.\"",

    "summary": "Almost a dozen people from a children's summer camp in Kerr County remain missing, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "At least 95 people are dead and dozens are still missing after devastating flash floods slammed Texas Hill Country, with water rescues taking place along the Guadalupe River, which rose rapidly early Friday morning to the height of a two-story building. Almost a dozen are still missing from Camp Mystic\u00a0in Kerr County, a girls' summer camp, officials said.",
      "Of the fatalities so far, 75 have occurred in Kerr County, its sheriff, Larry Leitha, said at a news conference Monday morning. The dead include 48 adults and 27 children, with 15 of the adults and nine of the children unidentified. Camp Mystic, located along the river in Hunt, Texas,\u00a0confirmed Monday that at least 27 campers and counselors died in the flooding.",
      "\"Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy. We are praying for them constantly,\" the camp said in a statement. \"We have been in communication with local and state authorities who are tirelessly deploying extensive resources to search for our missing girls. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from community, first responders, and officials at every level.\"",
      "At least 10 Camp Mystic campers are still missing, along with one counselor, Leitha said. That was the first solid number officials provided regarding campers who remained unaccounted for, after previously estimating that it could be as high as 27. There were about 750 children at Camp Mystic when the floods hit, the sheriff said earlier.",
      "President Trump signed a major disaster declaration for Kerr County, at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's request. On Saturday, Abbott said he visited the summer camp for the first time, calling the scene \"horrendously ravaged\" in a social media post.",
      "\"Today I visited Camp Mystic. It, and the river running beside it, were horrendously ravaged in ways unlike I've seen in any natural disaster,\" Abbott wrote. \"The height the rushing water reached to the top of cabins was shocking. We won't stop until we find every girl who was in those cabins. \"",
      "The governor said at a briefing Sunday afternoon that operations would continue around the clock to search for anyone affected by the deadly storm. In addition to the dead, officials have not been able to account for 41 people in various parts of the state, according to Abbott, who noted that figure may underrepresent how many people are truly missing.",
      "\"Especially in the Kerrville area, there were so many people camping out near the river, people in RVs and things like that,\" he said. \"There are people that are not known, confirmed missing because we do not know yet who they are.\"",
      "Abbott said searches will persist throughout the Guadalupe River system in hopes of locating anyone else and asked the public to contact local officials with information about friends or relatives believed lost.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday he ordered three swiftwater rescue teams to Texas.",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday told reporters he would visit Texas \"probably on Friday,\" noting he had wanted to go Sunday but would have been \"in their way.\"",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday mass, saying, \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe river in Texas in the United States.\"",
      "Although Kerr County was hit hardest by flooding, at least 13 others have been confirmed dead in different parts of Texas. About 150 miles east of Camp Mystic, Travis County has confirmed at least seven deaths, according to local officials. Travis County includes the Texas capital city of Austin.",
      "At least four people were confirmed dead in Burnet County on Monday, said Captain Mike Sorenson of the county sheriff's office. Abbott said two people remain missing in Burnet: a 17-year-old girl and the county fire chief. Derek Marchio, the emergency management coordinator for the county, previously said more than 50 rescues had been conducted countywide since the flooding crisis unfolded.",
      "Emergency management officials in Kendall County confirmed six deaths as of Monday and said rescue and recovery operations were still underway, and another two deaths were confirmed in Williamson County by county officials. Earlier, in Tom Green County, the San Angelo Police Department confirmed Saturday the death of a 62-year-old woman identified as Tanya Burwick. Police said Burwick was driving when her vehicle became submerged by floodwaters.",
      "Officials have conducted more than 160 air rescues, Leitha said in an earlier update, adding that 850 uninjured and eight injured people have been rescued overall as of Saturday. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving 223 of those people, as dramatic\u00a0video showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville, while dark water covered the ground.",
      "Noem also said Coast Guard rescue swimmer and Petty Officer Scott Ruskin \"saved an astonishing 165 victims in the devastating flooding in central Texas.  This was the first rescue mission of his career and he was the only triage coordinator at the scene.\" She called Ruskin \"an American hero.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security oversees the Federal Emergency Management Agency.",
      "\"We've been rescuing people out of these camps by the hundreds, you know, all day,\" said Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerville, on Saturday night. \"There's a lot of folks that are shelter in place, so we leave them in place to make sure that we get them food, water.\"",
      "Abbott originally signed a federal disaster declaration in the immediate aftermath of the floods early Friday, which he later updated to include several other counties in Texas that were damaged by storms.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said in Saturday's briefing that his property was also devastated by the flooding and he \"barely got home\" on Friday. Kelly also said he had visited a funeral home and \"got to see firsthand many of the body bags\" before going on a helicopter ride with Sen. John Cornyn and Kerrville Mayor Joe Herring to survey the damage.",
      "\"It's gonna be a long time before we're ever going to be able to clean it up much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said. \"We didn't know. We knew we'd get rain, we know the river rises but nobody saw this coming.\"",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said in a news briefing on Friday that there hadn't been \"a drop of rain until the tragedy struck\" earlier in the day, and that the Guadalupe River had risen about 26 feet in 45 minutes. An alert went out around 4 a.m. and 5 a.m. local time Friday, he said.",
      "As questions circulate as to whether the flood warnings and alerts were sufficient and effective, another summer camp near the Guadalupe River, Presbyterian Mo-Ranch Assembly, has received praise for its rapid evacuation. Lisa Winters, the communications director for the camp, told The Associated Press\u00a0that the facilities manager at Mo-Ranch noticed the river beginning to rise at about 1 a.m. local time Friday. Although camp leadership said they had not received evacuation guidance from local authorities, they quickly relocated about 70 children and adults who were staying overnight in a building near the water.",
      "Speaking to reporters late Friday night aboard Air Force One, Mr. Trump called the floods a \"terrible thing.\" On Saturday, he said his administration was working with state and local officials \"on the ground\" in Texas to respond to the flooding.",
      "\"Melania and I are praying for all the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,\" Mr. Trump wrote\u00a0in a Truth Social post. \"Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!\"",
      "How did the Guadalupe River flood so quickly?",
      "Meteorologists say storms in the area converged with remnant moisture from what was formerly\u00a0Tropical Storm Barry, which made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and moved northward. That produced exceptionally high rainfall totals in a region that is susceptible to flooding.",
      "Rice, Kerrville's city manager, explained how the Guadalupe River flooded so quickly.",
      "\"When you look at the headwaters of the Guadalupe ... there's a north and a south fork,\" Rice said Friday night. \"Since 1987, under normal conditions, if you can call it that, you'll hit water in one of those areas, and those two forks will converge into the Guadalupe, which comes through the city of Kerrville.\"",
      "\"This rain event sat on top of that and dumped more rain than what was forecasted on both of those forks,\" Rice continued. \"When we got the report, it was about 7 feet or so on the south fork, and within a matter of minutes it was up to 29 feet, and all of that converged at Guadalupe.\"",
      "The Guadalupe River at Hunt reached its second-highest height on record, higher than the famous 1987 flood,\u00a0the city said, citing the National Weather Service.",
      "The Texas Division of Emergency Management had multiple meetings since Thursday to prepare, but the National Weather Service \"did not predict the amount of rain\" that actually fell, officials said, adding that forecasters originally estimated up to 8 inches of rainfall for the area.",
      "Kerr County judge Rob Kelly said the area does \"not have a warning system,\" and authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods.",
      "\"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Texas issued flash flood emergencies in five counties in West Texas on Friday as Hill Country continued to be slammed by severe rain and flooding. Between 5 and 11 inches of rain have fallen in northwestern Bandera County, Central Kerr County, Northeastern Tom Green County, East Central Kerr County and West Central Kendall County,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Weather Service.",
      "Search and rescue operations are ongoing",
      "There are hundreds of people on the ground from various units helping with search and rescue operations, officials said. The operations have included drones, helicopters, rescue divers, boats and high-water vehicles, after Abbott signed a disaster declaration for several counties hit by flooding.",
      "At a news conference, the governor said his declaration \"ensures all the counties will have access to every tool, strategy, personnel that the state of Texas can provide to them, which will be limitless.\"",
      "\"We will stop at nothing to ensure that every asset and person and plane, whatever is needed, is going to be involved in the process of rescuing every last person and ensure everybody involved in this is going to be fully accounted for,\" Abbott said.",
      "Lorena Gullen, who owns a restaurant right next to an RV park that was affected by the floods, said \"raging water\" swept away vehicles, some with people still inside. Residents at the park had been celebrating the Fourth of July.",
      "\"You could also see vehicles coming from up the river with the lights on and hear somebody honking, and they were washing away but they kept going,\" she told \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It was impossible.\"",
      "Over 2 dozen people still missing",
      "Three girls from Dallas \u2014 8-year-olds Hadley Hanna and Eloise Peck   and 9-year-old Lila Bonner \u2014 were identified as missing Camp Mystic campers. Bonner's family confirmed to CBS Texas on Saturday that she was among the children confirmed dead in the flood and Peck's family on Sunday posted a note at their home saying she had died as well.",
      "Two sisters from Dallas \u2014 13-year-old Blair Harber and 11-year-old Brooke Harber \u2014 were also confirmed dead Saturday by the St. Rita Catholic Community church in Dallas. The sisters were not attending Camp Mystic, but were staying with their grandparents in an area along the Guadalupe River where the flooding occurred. Their grandparents remain unaccounted for, according to the church. The girls' parents were in a separate cabin and were not harmed.",
      "Meanwhile, Rep. August Pfluger of Texas said Saturday that two of his three children were evacuated from Camp Mystic.",
      "\"The last day has brought unimaginable grief to many families and we mourn with them as well as holding out hope for survivors,\" Pfluger said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Patrick addressed the parents of children at Camp Mystic. The lieutenant governor, who briefly acted as governor while Abbott was on vacation, said they are praying for all those missing \"to be found alive.\"",
      "\"If they are alive and safe, we will find them and bring them home to you,\" Patrick said Friday.",
      "Camp Mystic is an all-girls summer camp, which runs several camps attended by thousands of children during the summer, Patrick said. In a statement read Friday by the lieutenant governor, the camp said they did not have power, water or Wi-Fi in the aftermath of what it called a \"catastrophic level\" of flooding. The statement added that \"the highway has washed away, so we are struggling to get more help.\"",
      "Here's where you can donate to help Central Texas flood recovery",
      "Here's where you can donate to help Central Texas flood recovery",
      "The camp sits on a strip known as \"flash flood alley,\" Austin Dickson, the CEO of the Community Foundation of the Texas Hill Country, told The Associated Press. The foundation is a charitable endowment that collects donations to help nonprofits responding to the disaster.",
      "\"When it rains, water doesn't soak into the soil,\" Dickson said. \"It rushes down the hill.\"",
      "Elinor Lester, 13, told the AP that she and her cabinmates were evacuated by helicopter. Her cabin was on elevated ground, but younger campers bunked in cabins situated along the riverbank, she said. Those were the first to flood. Younger campers came up the hill for shelter.",
      "\"The camp was completely destroyed,\" she said. \"It was really scary. Everyone I know personally is accounted for, but there are people missing that I know of and we don't know where they are.\"",
      "Her mother, Elizabeth Lester, told the AP her son was at Camp La Junta, a nearby summer camp, and also survived after a counselor woke up, saw rising water and helped the boys swim out through a window.\u00a0Camp La Junta and another camp on the river,\u00a0Camp Waldemar, said in Instagram posts that all campers and staff there were safe.",
      "\"My kids are safe, but knowing others are still missing is just eating me alive,\" Elizabeth Lester told the AP.",

      "U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis said to Justice Department attorney Bridget O'Hickey, \"You made three arguments, defendants, and none are availing \u2026 meritless.\"",
      "Xinis, who had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. after he was sent to El Salvador in March, questioned O'Hickey about whether the U.S. had indicted him in order to facilitate his return. The government did not notify Xinis or Abrego Garcia's attorneys when he was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, was part of a group of more than 250 Venezuelan and Salvadoran men who were deported from the U.S. to El Salvador and held in CECOT, a maximum security prison, in mid-March. Soon afterward, he sued the government over his deportation. His amended suit asks Xinis that he be held in custody in Maryland, rather than in Tennessee, where he's currently being detained, as well as to block his deportation.",
      "\"Obviously you did have power to produce Mr. Abrego because you produced him less than a week later.\" Xinis told the government, citing the May 21 date of a sealed indictment against Abrego Garcia in Tennessee filed six days after a motion in Maryland that said the government had no power to return him to the U.S.",
      "Xinis said she found it \"highly problematic\" that there had been a plan by the government to investigate Abrego Garcia and bring him back for prosecution without informing her court that it was doing so. \"We knew it was coming because eventually it was unsealed,\" she said. Abrego Garcia's attorneys told Xinis they found out about his return to the U.S. from news reports.",
      "Abrego Garcia was transported to the U.S. in June and immediately indicted on human trafficking charges in Tennessee that stemmed from a traffic stop in 2019. He is being held in Tennessee pending trial.",
      "Arguing that Abrego Garcia's lawsuit should be dismissed, O'Hickey said the government had been in ongoing conversations with El Salvador to bring him back to the U.S. at the same time the Justice Department filed its motion to dismiss.",
      "\"How can this representation be one I can credit,\" Xinis asked.",
      "\"At some point, don't you have an obligation to me to say, 'Judge, we have the power, we produced him, moot,'\" she asked O'Hickey.",
      "She questioned whether the department's attorneys in Abrego Garcia's case knew the indictment in Tennessee was coming.",
      "O'Hickey said that at the time, the U.S. was still negotiating with El Salvador, and \"it was uncertain what agreement would be released with the foreign sovereign and how all that would play out.\"",
      "\"The proceedings were moving in tandem and negotiations were ongoing,\" O'Hickey said. She told Judge Xinis, \"Defendants certainly took steps to facilitate his return.\"",
      "\"Is the indictment one of those steps? Since we are talking about my court order,\" Xinis replied.",
      "Abrego Garcia \"wasn't under investigation until April \u2026 a month after this case started,\" Xinis said, a contention O'Hickey denied.",
      "\"I don't believe that's true, your honor,\" O'Hickey responded, contradicting law enforcement statements in Abrego Garcia's criminal case in Tennessee.",
      "Xinis also denied a second motion to dismiss by the Justice Department, which argued that the lawsuit is now moot, since Abrego Garcia is now in the U.S.",
      "She expressed concern that if Abrego Garcia were released from custody, he could be removed again, but listed actions the government could take to assure the court that her order would be followed.",
      "The government could \"name a specific country (where Abrego Garcia could be deported) and then give a reasonable amount of time\" to challenge that removal, Xinis said. And she offered that the government could \"clarify all of this\" in a \"binding way,\" if it stipulated that he would receive due process \u2014 that he would not be removed without notice and would have the opportunity to be heard before a court.",
      "Referring to his deportation as an \"isolated error,\" O'Hickey said, \"We've acknowledged this was an error and have now acknowledged that error and have no intention of making that error a second time.\"",
      "\"For three months your clients told the world they weren't going to do anything to bring him back,\" Xinis responded. \"Doesn't that matter?\" The president said it in two interviews. [Homeland Security Secretary Kristi] Noem said it. Arguably, [Attorney General Pam] Bondi said it. Am I really supposed to ignore all that?\"",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 14:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A memo from the Justice Department and FBI said that a systematic review of the case involving Jeffrey Epstein \"revealed no incriminating 'client list.'\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A Justice Department and FBI review of the investigation related to disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein found that there was no \"client list\" or evidence that he blackmailed prominent figures, according to a memo detailing the findings.",
      "The review also concluded that Epstein died by suicide while in custody at a Manhattan correctional facility in August 2019. Epstein was facing federal sex trafficking charges, and his death was subsequently investigated by the Justice Department's internal watchdog and the FBI.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI said in their memo that video footage reviewed by bureau investigators\u00a0 \u2014 and made available to the public \u2014 confirmed that Epstein was locked in his cell and nobody entered tiers of the unit where he was housed at the time of his death.",
      "Investigators also \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate any investigation against uncharged third parties,\" according to the memo.",
      "\"This systematic review revealed no incriminating 'client list.' There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions,\" the Justice Department and FBI said in their two-page document detailing the conclusions.",
      "Axios was first to report the memo with the Justice Department's findings.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI leaders had pledged to release information about Epstein after President Trump returned to the White House earlier this year. Files related to Epstein's case, as well as the circumstances surrounding his death, have been the subject of conspiracy theories for years. Among the speculation about the records involving Epstein was that the federal government was concealing information to shield powerful and prominent figures who were allegedly named in them.",
      "While Bondi suggested during a Fox News interview in February that a \"client list\" was sitting on her desk, the purported document never materialized.",
      "In February, a group of 15 right-wing social media influencers went to the White House and were given binders labeled \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1.\" The influencers said they received the binders from Bondi during a meeting that Mr. Trump, FBI Director Kash Patel and Vice President JD Vance also attended.",
      "But any hopes of new information were quickly dashed, as the social media figures said the binders contained documents that were already in the public domain. Bondi confirmed that the first tranche of declassified files largely contained records that were leaked but had not been made public by the federal government.",
      "Still, after Elon Musk and Mr. Trump had a falling out last month, the billionaire entrepreneur claimed that the administration had withheld the so-called Epstein files because the president was named in them. In response, Mr. Trump shared a social media post that rebuffed Musk's claim.",
      "The president told NBC News in an interview that any alleged links between him and Epstein were \"old news,\" and said he had not been friendly with the convicted sex offender for 18 years before his death.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the administration's approach to Epstein's case on Monday, telling reporters that it is \"committed to truth and to transparency.\"",
      "\"That's why the attorney general and the FBI director pledged, at the president's direction, to do an exhaustive review of all of the files related to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes and his death, and they put out a memo in conclusion of that review,\" she said. \"There was material they did not release, because, frankly, it was incredibly graphic and it contained child pornography, which is not something that's appropriate for public consumption. But they committed to an exhaustive investigation. That's what they did, and they provided the results of that.\"",
      "When asked about the \"client list\" that Bondi said was on her desk, Leavitt said the attorney general was referring to \"the entirety of all of the paperwork, all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes.\"",
      "The FBI and Justice Department said in their memo that the review confirmed that Epstein harmed more than 1,000 victims, each of whom suffered \"unique trauma.\"",
      "\"One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends,\" the memo said.",
      "The Justice Department and FBI added that while they have \"labored to provide the public with maximum information\" about Epstein and examine evidence in the government's possession, they determined that \"no further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\"",

    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' lawyer says the music mogul got a standing ovation from fellow prisoners when he returned to the federal lockup in Brooklyn after the verdict.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs got a standing ovation from fellow inmates when the music mogul returned to jail after being acquitted of sex trafficking and racketeering in his federal trial in New York, providing what his lawyer says might have been the best thing he could do for incarcerated Black men in America.",
      "Combs, 55, was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, but was acquitted on the most serious charges, which carried potential life-in-prison sentences.",
      "\"They all said: 'We never get to see anyone who beats the government,'\" attorney Marc Agnifilo told The Associated Press in a weekend interview days after the jury reached its verdict.",
      "The music mogul remains jailed at a federal lockup in Brooklyn after his conviction Wednesday on the prostitution-related charges, which could put him in prison for several more years. Any sentence will include credit for time served, which currently amounts to almost 10 months.",
      "After federal agents raided Combs' homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area in March 2024, Agnifilo said he told the \"I'll Be Missing You\" singer to expect to be arrested on sex trafficking charges.",
      "\"I said: 'Maybe it's your fate in life to be the guy who wins,'\" he recalled during a telephone interview briefly interrupted by a jailhouse call from Combs. \"They need to see that someone can win. I think he took that to heart.\"",
      "Blunt trial strategy works",
      "The verdict in Manhattan federal court came after a veteran team of eight defense lawyers led by Agnifilo executed a trial strategy that resonated with jurors. Combs passed lawyers notes during effective cross-examinations of nearly three dozen witnesses over two months, including Combs' ex-employees.",
      "The lawyers told jurors Combs was a jealous domestic abuser with a drug problem who participated in the swinger lifestyle through threesomes involving Combs, his girlfriends and another man.",
      "\"You may think to yourself, wow, he is a really bad boyfriend,\" Combs' lawyer Teny Geragos told jurors in her May opening statement. But that, she said, \"is simply not sex trafficking.\"",
      "Agnifilo said the blunt talk was a \"no brainer.\"",
      "\"The violence was so clear and up front and we knew the government was going to try to confuse the jury into thinking it was part of a sex trafficking effort. So we had to tell the jury what it was so they wouldn't think it was something it wasn't,\" he said.",
      "Combs and his lawyers seemed deflated Tuesday when jurors said they were deadlocked on the racketeering count but had reached a verdict on sex trafficking and lesser prostitution-related charges. A judge ordered them back to deliberate Wednesday.",
      "\"No one knows what to think,\" Agnifilo said. Then he slept on it.",
      "Morning surprise awakes lawyer",
      "\"I wake up at three in the morning and I text Teny and say: \"We have to get a bail application together,\" he recalled. \"It's going to be a good verdict for us but I think he went down on the prostitution counts so let's try to get him out.\"",
      "He said he \"kind of whipped everybody into feeling better\" after concluding jurors would have convicted him of racketeering if they had convicted him of sex trafficking because trafficking was an alleged component of racketeering.",
      "Agnifilo met with Combs before court and Combs entered the courtroom rejuvenated. Smiling, the onetime Catholic schoolboy prayed with family. In less than an hour, the jury matched Agnifilo's prediction.",
      "The seemingly chastened Combs mouthed \"thank you\" to jurors and smiled as family and supporters applauded. After he was escorted from the room, spectators cheered the defense team, a few chanting: \"Dream Team! Dream Team!\" Several lawyers, including Geragos, cried.",
      "\"This was a major victory for the defense and a major loss for the prosecution,\" said Mitchell Epner, a lawyer who worked with Agnifilo as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey over two decades ago. He credited \"a dream team of defense lawyers\" against prosecutors who almost always win.",
      "Agnifilo showcased what would become his trial strategy \u2014 belittling the charges and mocking the investigation that led to them \u2014 last September in arguing unsuccessfully for bail. The case against Combs was what happens when the \"federal government comes into our bedrooms,\" he said.",
      "Lawyers gently questioned most witnesses",
      "During an eight-week trial, Combs' lawyers picked apart the prosecution case with mostly gentle but firm cross-examinations. Combs never testified and his lawyers called no witnesses.",
      "Sarah Krissoff, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan from 2008 to 2021, said Combs' defense team \"had a narrative from the beginning and they did all of it without putting on any witnesses. That's masterful.\"",
      "Ironically, Agnifilo expanded the use of racketeering laws as a federal prosecutor on an organized crime task force in New Jersey two decades ago, using them often to indict street gangs in violence-torn cities.",
      "\"I knew the weak points in the statute,\" he said. \"The statute is very mechanical. If you know how the car works, you know where the fail points are.\"",
      "He said prosecutors had \"dozens of fail points.\"",
      "\"They didn't have a conspiracy, they just didn't,\" he said. \"They basically had Combs' personal life and tried to build racketeering around personal assistants.\"",
      "Some personal assistants, even after viewing videos of Combs beating his longtime girlfriend, Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, had glowing things to say about Combs on cross examination.",
      "Once freed, Combs likely to reenter domestic abusers program",
      "For Combs, Agnifilo sees a long road ahead once he is freed and resumes work on personal demons, likely reentering a program for domestic batterers that he had just started before his arrest.",
      "\"He's doing OK,\" said Agnifilo, who speaks with him four or five times daily.",
      "He said Combs genuinely desires improvement and \"realizes he has flaws like everyone else that he never worked on.\"",
      "\"He burns hot in all matters. I think what he has come to see is that he has these flaws and there's no amount of fame and no amount of fortune\" that can erase them,\" he said. \"You can't cover them up.\"",
      "For Agnifilo, a final surprise awaited him after Combs' bail was rejected when a man collapsed into violent seizures at the elevators outside the courtroom.",
      "\"I'm like: 'What the hell?'\" recalled the lawyer, who has experience in treating seizures.",
      "Agnifilo straddled him, pulling him onto his side and using a foot to prevent him from rolling backward while a law partner, Jacob Kaplan, put a backpack under the man's head and Agnifilo's daughter took his pulse.",
      "\"We made sure he didn't choke on vomit. It was crazy. I was worried about him,\" he said.",
      "The man was eventually taken away conscious by rescue workers, leaving Agnifilo to ponder a tumultuous day.",
      "\"It was like I was getting punked by God,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Russia's state-run media say ex-Minister of Transport Roman Starovoy likely killed himself hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin.",
    "story": [
      "Russia's Minister of Transport reportedly killed himself just hours after being fired by President Vladimir Putin, according to the country's state-run news agency, which cited the national Investigative Committee. A second senior Transport Ministry official reportedly died soon after, for reasons which remain unclear.",
      "Roman Starovoy fatally shot himself Monday in his car in Odintsovo, a city west of Moscow, according to a statement from the committee that was reported by Russia's TASS news agency.",
      "\"The circumstances of the incident are being established,\" TASS cited the Investigative Committee as saying. \"The main hypothesis is suicide.\"",
      "Forbes Russia reported that Starovoy, 53, died \"presumably overnight between Saturday and Sunday,\" citing an anonymous source close to state investigators. It was not possible to explain the discrepancy between the times of death reported by Forbes and the official Russian media.",
      "Putin had dismissed Starovoy just hours earlier, according to a decree published by the Kremlin. No official reason was given, but ongoing Ukranian drone attacks on Russia caused chaos for air traffic in the country over the weekend, prompting the cancellation of hundreds of flights and stranding passengers.",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense claimed to have intercepted at least 120 drones over 10 different regions of the country between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "Officials in Ukraine, meanwhile, said Monday that at least 11 civilians were killed and more than 80 others injured, including seven children, in Russian drone attacks. Russia has intensified its missile and drone strikes, including many that hit civilian areas, in recent days.",
      "President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that over the past week alone, Russia had launched about 1,270 drones, 39 missiles and nearly 1,000 glide bombs at Ukraine.",
      "Starovoy became Russia's Transport Minister in 2024, before which he was the governor of the Kursk region on the border with Ukraine.",
      "Another official reportedly \"stood up sharply\u2026 and fell dead\"",
      "Soon after Starovoy's death was reported by Russian media, a lower-ranking official whose job fell within the remit of the Transport Ministry, 42-year-old Andrei Korneichuk, was said to have died suddenly during a meeting.",
      "At his office in eastern Moscow, Korneichuk, who was the deputy head of the Federal Road Agency's Land Fund Department, \"stood up sharply during a meeting and fell dead,\" according to the SHOT news outlet, which is said to be close to the military.",
      "\"The medics could not help him,\" SHOT added. The independent Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta said at least two other Russian government-linked news outlets had reported the same basic details.",
      "The preliminary cause of death was determined to be cardiac arrest, according to the media outlets cited by the Gazeta.",
      "The two deaths come just days after that of the vice-president of Russian state oil company Transneft.",
      "The body of Andrei Badalov, 62, was found \"beneath the window of a house\" in western Moscow on Friday, TASS cited law enforcement officials as saying. The state news agency said he had written a farewell message to his wife.",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 15:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Researchers were able to date the fossil of the flying reptile, a close cousin of dinosaurs, back to more than 209 million years ago.",
    "story": [
      "For paleontologist Ben Kligman, the question was: Is this fragile jawbone a pterosaur or not?",
      "Other researchers also had questions about the fossil, unearthed along with thousands of others during a decades-long archaeological dig at a remote bone bed in the Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona. Some thought the bone could've been a mammal, Kligman told CBS News.",
      "Now, their new research offers insight into North America's oldest known flying reptile that Kligman and other paleontologists say was the size of a \"small seagull.\"",
      "The Smithsonian-led paper,\u00a0published Monday\u00a0in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, details the new pterosaur fossil discovery along with several others, providing insight into the late Triassic period.",
      "Kligman remembers looking at the jawbone under a microscope at the Smithsonian \u2014 where he is a Peter Buck postdoctoral fellow and where the fossil had been sent \u2014 and running through his \"Rolodex\" of Triassic jaw anatomy, thinking about what species could have a similar jaw. He wanted to solve the mystery of where the delicate jawbone belonged.",
      "Through the process of elimination, and thinking of the features pterosaurs have that no other animal has, Kligman said he and other researchers were able to conclude that, \"Oh yeah, this is definitely a pterosaur \u2014 therefore, this is a very important discovery.\"",
      "The team named the pterosaur the Eotephradactylus mcintireae, which means \"ash-winged dawn goddess.\" The species name references its discoverer, Suzanne McIntire, who volunteered in the Smithsonian's FossiLab for 18 years.",
      "McIntire discovered the pterosaur fossil, which had been brought to the museum from the Petrified Forest National Park along with 1,200 other individual fossils, including bones, teeth, fish scales and coprolites, or fossilized excrement.",
      "Volunteers painstakingly clean each fossil, flag ones of interest and perform other fossil conservation tasks. McIntire unearthed the jawbone and noticed the teeth were still in the bone, making it easier to identify.",
      "The winged reptile \u2014 a close cousin of dinosaurs and the first animals after insects to evolve powered flight \u2014 would've been small enough to comfortably perch on a person's shoulder.",
      "\"It could've sat on your shoulder, like a small seagull,\" Kligman said of the species.",
      "Researchers were able to date the fossil back to 209.2 million years ago \u2014 an unusually precise date, Kligman said, because of the level of volcanic ash where the fossil was found. The finding helps fill in a gap in the fossil record that predates the end-Triassic extinction, he said. Very few pterosaur fossils exist, Kligman said. After their extinction, their fragile bones preserved poorly, so pterosaur fossils are frequently incomplete. They also did not live close to places where fossils tend to form.",
      "\"It helps us understand what a pterosaur was and how they became what they would become,\" Kligman said.",
      "Along with the pterosaur, the study also detailed other findings, including one of the world's oldest turtle fossils, giant amphibians and armored crocodile relatives, which lived alongside evolutionary upstarts like frogs, turtles and pterosaurs.",

    "story": [
      "Indonesia's rumbling Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki erupted twice on Monday, sending a column of volcanic materials up to 11 miles into the sky, dumping ash on villages and causing dozens flight cancellations.",
      "No casualties were immediately reported. The volcano on Flores island has been at the highest alert level since an eruption on June 18, and an exclusion zone was doubled to a 4.3-mile radius as eruptions became more frequent.",
      "Indonesia's Geology Agency recorded an avalanche of searing gas clouds mixed with rocks and lava traveling up to 3 miles down the slopes of the 5,197-foot mountain. Observations from drones showed lava filling the crater, indicating deep movement of magma that set off earthquakes.",
      "The initial column of hot clouds that rose just after 11:00 a.m. local time (0305 GMT) was the volcano's highest since a major eruption in November 2024\u00a0that killed nine people and injured dozens, said Muhammad Wafid, the Geology Agency chief. It also erupted in March.",
      "\"An eruption of that size certainly carries a higher potential for danger, including its impact on aviation,\" Wafid told The Associated Press. \"We shall reevaluate to enlarge its danger zone that must be cleared of villagers and tourist activities.\"",
      "In a statement, Wafid urged the public and tourists to stay at least four miles from the eruption, remain calm and follow the directions of the local government.",
      "\"The public is asked not to believe information from unclear sources,\" Wafid said. \"In addition, people around disaster-prone areas should be aware of the potential for lava floods if heavy rain occurs.\".",
      "The volcano erupted again just after 7:30 p.m. (1100 GMT), spewing lava and sending clouds of ash up to 8 miles into the air, according to the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation.",
      "By Monday afternoon, at least 24 flights between Bali and Australia, Singapore and South Korea were cancelled and many others were delayed. Flights on four domestic routes were cancelled, said Ahmad Syaugi Shahab, spokesperson for Bali's Ngurah Rai international airport.",
      "He said the airport was running normally despite the cancellations, as monitoring showed the volcanic ash had not affected Bali's airspace.",
      "\"Several airlines serving the routes to Labuan Bajo (on Flores), Australia, Singapore, and South Korea have confirmed cancellations and delays,\" he said in a statement.",
      "He said the airlines included Virgin Australia, Jetstar Airways and AirAsia Indonesia.",
      "Australia's Jetstar said several flights were cancelled \"due to volcanic ash caused by an eruption of Mount Lewotobi.\"",
      "Falling ash after the initial eruption blanketed several villages with debris and blocked sunlight for almost half an hour, Hadi Wijaya, head of the Center for Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation, said in a statement.",
      "He said volcanic materials, including thumb-size fragments of gravel and ash, were thrown up to 5 miles from the crater. He warned residents to be vigilant about heavy rainfall that could trigger lava flows in rivers originating from the volcano.",
      "Photos and videos circulated on social media showed the ash cloud expanding into a mushroom shape as tons of volcanic debris covered houses up to their rooftops in nearby villages. Some residents ran in panic under the rain of volcanic material or fled with motorbikes and cars.",
      "Monday's eruptions were the result of the accumulation of energy due to a blockage of magma in the crater, which reduced detectable seismic activity while building up pressure, Wijaya said.",
      "The initial eruption was one of Indonesia's largest since 2010 when Mount Merapi, the country's most volatile volcano, erupted on the densely populated island of Java. That killed 353 people and forced over 350,000 people to evacuate.",
      "Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 280 million people with frequent seismic activity. It has 120 active volcanoes and sits along the \"Ring of Fire,\" a horseshoe-shaped series of seismic fault lines encircling the Pacific Basin.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union expects to find out on Monday whether President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on America's largest trade partner in a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.",
      "President Trump said on social media this weekend that he would start sending tariff increase letters to countries with which the U.S. does not reach satisfactory trade deals beginning at noon on Monday. Japan and South Korea were the first recipients, with letters from the Trump administration sent to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and South Korean President Lee Jae-myung on Monday indicating that 25% tariffs on their respective countries will go into effect on August 1.",
      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure with the EU's stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything \u2014 from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals \u2014 much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU's executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc's 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNN's \"State of the Union\" program on Sunday that \"the EU was very slow in coming to the table\" but that talks were now making \"very good progress.\"",
      "Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union.",
      "\"Most important\" trade relationship",
      "The European Commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as \"the most important commercial relationship in the world.\"",
      "The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat.",
      "The biggest U.S. export to Europe was crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment.",
      "Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. were pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits.",
      "Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around.",
      "However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "Less-friendly posture toward longstanding ally",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\"On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. \"They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\"",
      "U.S. consumers would likely be hurt most",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \"until further notice.\" The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \"significant increases\" in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\"If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\" Arnault said. \"And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\"",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.",
      "Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \"the U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of 'retaliatory' tariffs well beyond 10%,\" Schmieding said. \"However, the road to get there could be rocky.\"",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\"While Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a 'win' for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\" Schmieding said.",

    "summary": "Trump has made it clear that he wants an Israel-Hamas ceasefire to be his next diplomatic achievement. Can he convince Netanyahu the time is right to make a deal?",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv, Israel\u00a0\u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump might look to take a victory lap Monday after their recent joint strikes on Iran, hailed by both as an unmitigated success. But as they meet for the third time this year at the White House, the outwardly triumphant visit will be dogged by Israel's 21-month war against Hamas in Gaza and questions over how hard Mr. Trump will push for an end to the conflict.",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that following the 12-day war between Israel and Iran, he would like to see the Gaza conflict end soon, ideally with a ceasefire agreement reached \u00a0this week. The meeting between Mr. Trump and Netanyahu could give new urgency to a U.S. ceasefire proposal being discussed by Israel and Hamas, but whether it will lead to a deal that ends the war is unclear.",
      "\"The optics will be very positive,\" said Michael Oren, a former Israeli ambassador to Washington. \"But behind the victory lap are going to be some very serious questions.\"",
      "Before departing for Washington on Sunday, Netanyahu praised the cooperation with the U.S. for bringing a \"huge victory over our shared enemy.\" He struck a positive note on a ceasefire for Gaza, saying he was working \"to achieve the deal under discussion, on the terms we agreed to.\"",
      "\"I think that the discussion with President Trump can certainly help advance that result, which all of us hope for,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Israel and Hamas appear to be inching toward a new ceasefire agreement that would bring about a 60-day pause in the fighting, send aid flooding into Gaza and free at least some of the remaining 50 hostages held in the territory, 20 of whom Netanyahu says are still alive.",
      "But a perennial sticking point is whether the ceasefire will end the war altogether. Hamas has said it is willing to free all the hostages in exchange for an end to the war and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Netanyahu has said the war will only end when Hamas is militarily defeated or surrenders, disarms and goes into exile \u2014 something the terrorist group's remaining leaders have refused to do.",
      "Trump's quest to be known as peacemaker",
      "Mr. Trump has made it clear that he wants to be known as a peacemaker. He's repeatedly touted recent peace deals that his administration helped to facilitate \u2014 between India and Pakistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda, and Israel and Iran \u2014 and for years he has made little secret of the fact that he covets a Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "He has been pressuring Israel and Hamas to wrap up their own conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians, ravaged Gaza, deepened Israel's international isolation and made any resolution to the broader conflict between Israel and the Palestinians more distant than ever.",
      "But the precise details of the proposed ceasefire deal, and whether it can lead to an end to the war, are still in flux. In the days before Netanyahu's visit, Mr. Trump seemed less certain of the chances of an imminent breakthrough.",
      "Asked on Friday how confident he was that a ceasefire deal would come together, he told reporters: \"I'm very optimistic \u2014 but you know, look, it changes from day to day.\"",
      "On Sunday evening, he seemed to narrow his expectations, telling reporters that he thought an agreement related to the remaining hostages would be reached in the coming week.",
      "Gaza peace hinged on Trump and Netanyahu's personal ties?",
      "After Mr. Trump's decision to get involved in Israel's war in Iran with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, he and Netanyahu have looked and sounded more in sync than ever. But that's not always been the case.",
      "As recently as Netanyahu's last visit to Washington in April, the tone was markedly different.",
      "Mr. Trump used the photo-op with Netanyahu to announce that the U.S. was entering into negotiations with Iran over its nuclear deal \u2014 appearing to catch the Israeli leader off guard and at the time, slamming the brakes on any Israeli military plan.",
      "He also praised Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a fierce critic of Israel's, in front of Netanyahu, and the two made no apparent progress on a trade deal at the height of Mr. Trump's tariff expansion.",
      "Mr. Trump, whose policies have largely aligned with Israel's own priorities, pledged last week to be \"very firm\" with Netanyahu on ending the war, without saying what that would entail. Pressure by Mr. Trump may have helped to convince Netanyahu in the past, with a previous ceasefire deal having been reached right as the president was taking office for his second term.",
      "Netanyahu has to balance the demands of his American ally with the far-right parties in his governing coalition who hold the key to his political survival and oppose ending the war.",
      "But given the strong U.S. support in Israel's war against Iran, highlighted by joint airstrikes on three key Iranian nuclear sites, Netanyahu may have a tough time saying no.",
      "On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump said one of the matters he expected to discuss with Netanyahu \"is probably a permanent deal with Iran.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also may expect something in return for his recent calls for Netanyahu's corruption trial to be canceled \u2014 a significant interference in the domestic affairs of a sovereign state.",
      "\"Trump thinks that Netanyahu owes him,\" said Eytan Gilboa, an expert on U.S.-Israel affairs at Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. \"And if Trump thinks that he needs to end the war In Gaza, then that is what he will need to do.\"",
      "Trump's vision for a remade Middle East hinged on Gaza",
      "But beyond Iran is Mr. Trump's grand vision for a new Middle East, where he hopes that additional countries will join the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements normalizing relations between Arab countries and Israel brokered during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Netanyahu and Mr. Trump are likely to discuss how to bring Syria into the fold. The country, a longtime enemy of Israel's, has new leadership after the fall of President Bashar Assad, and experts say conditions might be ripe for some kind of nonbelligerency agreement.",
      "Just last week, Mr. Trump signed an executive order lifting a raft of U.S. sanctions against the Syrian government, paving the way for the nation's new leaders \u2014 former Islamist militants who publicly embraced secularism after toppling Assad \u2014 to further cement their governance and join the international community.",
      "But Mr. Trump's ultimate goal is to include regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia.",
      "The Saudis, whose clout could open the door for other Arab or Muslim countries to join, have expressed interest in normalizing ties with Israel but only if it is accompanied by serious steps toward resolving Israel's conflict with the Palestinians. For starters, that would seem to require action in Gaza.",
      "\"The most important thing (for Mr. Trump) is to end the war in Gaza,\" Gilboa said. \"That is the key to all the regional peace in the Middle East.\"",

    "summary": "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it deported a group of eight men convicted of serious crimes in the United States to the conflict-ridden African country of South Sudan, following a legal saga that had kept the deportees stuck in a military base in Djibouti for weeks.",
      "Assistant Department of Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the deportation flight carrying the deportees landed in South Sudan just before midnight Eastern time on Friday. A photo provided by the department showed the deportees, with their hands and feet shackled, sitting inside an aircraft, guarded by U.S. service members.",
      "The deportations to South Sudan \u2014 a country plagued by armed conflict and political instability that the U.S. government warns Americans not to visit \u2014 mark an unprecedented new frontier in President Trump's government-wide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "None of the deportees is from South Sudan. They hail from Cuba, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam, and were ordered deported from the U.S. after being convicted of crimes, including murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery.",
      "The high-profile legal battle over the fate of the men culminated when two federal judges on Friday denied a last-ditch attempt by immigration rights advocates to halt the deportations, saying their hands were tied by recent orders from the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "The deportations signify a major political victory for the Trump administration, which has sought to convince countries around the world \u2014 irrespective of their human rights record \u2014 to accept deportees who are not their citizens, including those convicted of serious crimes.",
      "\"A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,\" said McLaughlin, the DHS spokeswoman. \"This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.\"",
      "The deportations have also alarmed human rights advocates, who fear the men could face jail time, torture or other harms in South Sudan. They've argued the deportations to South Sudan are designed to punish the men for their crimes, even though they have already served criminal sentences in the U.S.",
      "\"The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan, yet deported these men there without any due process,\" said Trina Realmuto, an attorney for the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which tried to halt the deportations. \"Make no mistake about it, these deportations were punitive and unconstitutional.\"",
      "It's unclear exactly how the deportees will be treated in South Sudan. A Justice Department attorney told a federal judge Friday that South Sudan informed the U.S. it would offer the men a temporary immigration status, but the lawyer could not confirm whether they would be detained. The Trump administration has said in court filings that South Sudanese officials have made assurances that the deportees will not face torture.",
      "The men's deportation was made possible by a Supreme Court order earlier this week. At the request of the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified the scope of an earlier order it had issued to pause a lower court ruling barring deportations to third-party countries without a degree of due process and notice.",
      "That April lower court ruling by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Massachusetts had required the Trump administration to give detainees sufficient notice and a chance to be interviewed by a U.S. asylum officer before any deportation to a country where they did not hail from. That case thwarted several deportation efforts, including a plan to send detainees to Libya.",
      "When he learned of the administration's plan to deport the eight men to South Sudan in May, Murphy blocked that effort, mandating the U.S. to retain custody of the detainees and to offer them a chance to contest their deportation. The administration transferred the detainees to the Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti, where U.S. officials described dangerous conditions, including concerns about malaria, rocket attacks, inadequate security protocols and triple-digit outdoor temperatures.",
      "But the Supreme Court last month suspended Murphy's ruling from April. And on Thursday, it said Murphy could no longer require the government to allow the detainees in Djibouti to contest their deportation, since the order underpinning that requirement had been paused.",
      "Hours later, immigrant rights advocates asked a different federal judge, Randolph Moss in Washington, D.C., to halt the deportations to South Sudan. He did so on Friday, but only briefly before saying the request should be handled by Murphy.",
      "Moss expressed concern about risks to the men's \"physical safety\" and said the U.S. government should not be in the business of inflicting \"pain and suffering\" on people who have already served their sentence, even for a \"terrible crime.\" But he said his hands were tied, telling the advocates they needed to ask Murphy for any intervention.",
      "Later on Friday, Murphy denied the advocates' request, saying the Supreme Court orders were \"binding.\"",

    "summary": "Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
    "story": [
      "Melbourne, Australia \u2014 Australian Erin Patterson was found guilty Monday of murdering three of her estranged husband's relatives by deliberately serving them poisonous mushrooms for lunch.",
      "The jury in the Supreme Court trial in Victoria state returned a verdict after six days of deliberations, following a nine-week trial that gripped Australia. Patterson faces life in prison and will be sentenced later, but a date for the hearing hasn't been scheduled.",
      "Patterson, who sat in the dock between two prison officers, showed no emotion but blinked rapidly as the verdicts were read.",
      "Three of Patterson's four lunch guests - her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail's sister Heather Wilkinson - died in the hospital after the 2023 meal at her home in Leongatha, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms.",
      "She was also found guilty of attempting to murder Ian Wilkinson, Heather's husband, who survived the meal.",
      "It wasn't disputed that Patterson served the mushrooms or that the pastries killed her guests. The jury was required to decide whether she knew the lunch contained death caps, and if she intended for them to die.",
      "The guilty verdicts, which were required to be unanimous, indicated that jurors rejected Patterson's defense that the presence of the poisonous fungi in the meal was a terrible accident, caused by the mistaken inclusion of foraged mushrooms that she didn't know were death caps. Prosecutors didn't offer a motive for the killings, but during the trial highlighted strained relations between Patterson and her estranged husband, and frustration that she had felt about his parents in the past.",
      "Victims' relatives asked for privacy in the wake of the jury's decision, police said, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The families \"have asked for privacy at this time,\" Victoria Police said in a statement. \"We will continue to support them in every way possible following this decision.\"",
      "Facts of case weren't disputed so Patterson's intentions were key",
      "The case turned on the question of whether Patterson meticulously planned a triple murder or accidentally killed three people she loved, including her children's only surviving grandparents. Her lawyers said she had no reason to - she had recently moved to a beautiful new home, was financially comfortable, had sole custody of her children and was due to begin studying for a degree in nursing and midwifery.",
      "But prosecutors suggested Patterson had two faces - the woman who publicly appeared to have a good relationship with her parents-in-law, while her private feelings about them were kept hidden. Her relationship with her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, who was invited to the fatal lunch but didn't go, deteriorated in the year before the deaths, the prosecution said.",
      "The simplest facts of what happened that day and immediately afterward were hardly disputed. But Patterson's motivations for what she did and why were pored over in detail during the lengthy trial, at which more than 50 witnesses were called.",
      "The individual beef Wellington pastries Patterson served her guests was one point of friction, because the recipe she used contained directions for a single, family-sized portion. Prosecutors said that she reverted to individual servings so she could lace the other diners' portions, but not her own, with the fatal fungi - but Patterson said that she was unable to find the correct ingredients to make the recipe as directed.",
      "Nearly every other detail of the fateful day was scrutinized at length, including why Patterson sent her children out to a film before her guests arrived, why she added additional dried mushrooms to the recipe from her pantry, why she didn't become ill when the other diners did, and why she disposed of a food dehydrator after the deaths and told investigators she didn't own one.",
      "Patterson acknowledged some lies during her evidence - including that she'd never foraged mushrooms or owned a dehydrator. But she said those claims were made in panic as she realized her meal had killed people.",
      "She said she didn't become as ill as the other diners since she vomited after the meal because of an eating disorder. She denied she told her guests she had cancer as a ruse to explain why she invited them to her home that day.",
      "The case gripped Australia",
      "The bizarre and tragic case has lingered in the minds of Australians and has provoked fervor among the public and media.",
      "During the trial, five separate podcasts analyzed each day of the proceedings and several news outlets ran live blogs giving moment-by-moment accounts of more than two months of evidence.",
      "At least one television drama and a documentary about the case are slated for production. Prominent Australian crime writers were seen in court throughout the trial.",
      "As it became clear half-an-hour before the verdict that court was reconvening, about 40 members of the public queued outside the courthouse in the rural town of Morwell in hope of watching the outcome in person. News outlets reported that no family members of victims were there.",
      "Before the verdict, newspapers published photos of black privacy screens erected at the entrance to Erin Patterson's home. Dozens of reporters from throughout Australia and from news outlets abroad crowded around friends of Patterson's as they left the courthouse Monday.",
      "\"I'm saddened, but it is what it is,\" said one friend, Ali Rose, who wore sunglasses and fought back tears. Asked what she thought Patterson felt as the verdicts were read, Rose said, \"I don't know.\"",
      "Details on the poisonous mushrooms that were served",
      "\"Death caps\" -- or amanita phalloides - are the deadliest mushrooms in the world, causing some 90 percent of fungus-related fatalities, according to AFP.",
      "It's easy to mistake the brown-and-white mushrooms for others, and they're said to have a\u00a0 pleasant taste when cooked.",
      "But toxicologist Dimitri Gerostamoulos testified that they're saturated with deadly chemicals known as amatoxins.",
      "\"They can lead to someone experiencing symptoms of diarrhoea, vomiting, feeling really unwell and they progressively get worse if the toxins are not removed,\" Gerostamoulos said."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 6, 2025.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: We turn now to Kevin Hassett. He is the director of the National Economic Council and one of President Trump's top advisors. He's also very popular on that driveway where I'm usually alongside about a dozen reporters. So, Kevin, thank you so much for your time this morning. I want to start with trade, because there's a big deadline coming up on Wednesday. As you know, that 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs that the President announced back in April is set to end. So far, the US has announced a few deals; the UK, Vietnam, and you're inching closer to a final agreement with China. Do you expect to get any more deals done with America's biggest trading partners by Wednesday?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah. First, I do have to take- take a pause and share your thoughts and prayers with the people of Texas. It's an incredible, heartbreaking story, and Kristi Noem and the President have instructed the federal government to throw everything they've got at helping the survivors and helping clean up that place. So, anyway, I'm really heartbroken today to see these stories, and I want you to know that in the White House, everybody is putting every effort they can into helping the people of Texas today. On trade, there's going to be quite a bit of news this week. And, I think, the headline of the news is that there are going to be deals that are finalized. There are a whole number that Jameson Greer has negotiated with foreign governments, and then they're going to be letters that are sent to countries saying, here's how we think it ought to go, because the deals aren't advanced enough. And the headline is going to be that countries are agreeing around the world to open their markets up to our products, and to allow us to put some kind of tariff on their products when they come into the US. At exactly what the numbers will be, will be things that you'll find out in the news this week,.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, you said there are going to be deals. For those really important trading partners, if there's not a deal by Wednesday, is the President going to extend this pause?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: You know, the United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything that's going on in the world. And there are deadlines, and there are things that are close, and so maybe things will push back the dead- past the deadline, or maybe they want- in the end, the President's going to make that judgment.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: And you also mentioned those letters that will start going out tomorrow, according to President Trump. He said about 10 to 12 countries will receive them. Do you- can you tell us who's going to get one and what they say?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Because- because, again, the part of the letter that could be happening right is that we're close to a deal, we're not really satisfied with the progress that we're making at the deal, and so we're saying, okay, fine, we're going to send a letter, but maybe you get a deal at the last minute too. Until we see everything that plays out, I think that we need to just hold our fire and watch for the news this week.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Is it fair to say that those notices are going to go to our smaller trading partners, as you negotiate with our bigger ones?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: I think that it could be that it'll be both. But also, don't forget, that when we have great trade deals, our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners. And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I have to ask you about the deadlines, Kevin, to make these deals, because you just mentioned you're always open. The president said there's not really any flexibility left between now and Wednesday. Less than two weeks ago, the Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that deals would be wrapped up by Labor Day. So, I wonder, you know, if- how can companies plan if the goal posts keep moving? How can countries negotiate if they don't even know how much time they have left?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well, the rough outlines of the deals are becoming clear to everybody, because we have some deals like the UK, and the Vietnam deal that are starting to be, you know, I guess, guidelines for what might happen. But, one of the things that we're seeing that's really interesting to me, is that people are just on-shoring production of the US at a record rate. As we've had record job creation, record capital spending, and this is even ahead of the Big, Beautiful Bill. And so, I think what's happening is that people are responding to President Trump's, you know, potential threats to have high tariffs on countries by moving their activity here into the US, which is creating jobs, more than 2 million jobs, since he took office, and raising wages. You know, wage growth is heading up towards the really, really high pinnacles that we saw in 2017. And so, I think there's a race right now to get activity into the US. And, in part, that race has been kicked off by President Trump.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I remember after these reciprocal tariffs were announced, you told me that there were about 15 deals that countries were bringing to the President. How close, if you could give us any number at all, what number are we going to see this week?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Yeah, you'll have- you'll have to get that from Jameson and the President. I think that, you know, we've seen lots of deals that have been finalized by our negotiators, and then the President finds things that could make them better. And so, it's- I'm not going to get ahead of the President on the number of deals.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Okay, thanks, Kevin. We'll look out for that. I want to move now to the One Big, Beautiful Bill that, of course, the President signed into law on Independence Day. You have it, and now you have to pay for it. And there's a consensus that this bill adds tremendously to the deficit. I know that you are so familiar with these numbers. The Yale Budget Lab estimates it will add $3 trillion to the debt. The Tax Foundation says this tax portion of the bill could also add $3 trillion to the deficit. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which factors in interest on the debt, says it could add up to $5 trillion over the next decade. And on this very program, even Speaker Johnson answered in the affirmative when asked if this bill would add over $4 trillion to the deficit. I know that the administration says the bill will actually shrink the deficit by $1.5 trillion. Help me understand why there is such a drastic difference between your number and all those others.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, first of all, let's remember that science is not democracy. Truth is not democracy. Our estimates are based on modeling that we used last time, when I was Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers to say what would happen if we had a bill, how much growth we would get. And we said, and we were criticized soundly, that we would get 3% growth. And we even had the really technical macroeconomic models that said that we would get 3% growth. We run the same models through this tax bill, it's even better. And what we're seeing is that if you get 3% growth again, then that's $4 trillion more in revenue than the CBO and these other bodies are giving us credit for. They have been wrong in the past, and they're being wrong again, in our belief. But, the thing that disappoints me is that if I put out a model and I say, hey, here's what's going to happen, we're going to get 3% growth. And then it turns out it's 1.5% growth, then, as an academic economist, as a scientist, then it's my duty to say, what did I get wrong? What did my model miss? These people aren't doing that. And that's the thing that I find disappointing, because we put peer-reviewed academic stuff on the table, said we're going to get that 3% growth, and then we got it right last time, and we believe we're going to get it right this time. But, if you think that 1.8% growth is what's going to happen over the next 10 years, then you should agree with the CBO number. But, there's another part of the CBO number that you need to worry about. And that is that if we don't pass the bill, that it's the biggest tax hike in history. And with that big tax hike, that of course, we would have a recession. The CEA says that we'd have about a 4% drop in GDP and lose 9 million jobs. If we had a 4% drop in GDP and we lost 9 million jobs, what would happen to the deficit? And so, I don't think that the CBO has a very strong record. I don't think these places have a very strong record. And what they need to do is get back to the basics of looking at macroeconomic models. There's a really famous macroeconomist at Harvard named Jim Stock. They should go back and read everything Jim Stock has written for the last 15 years, and fold those into their models, and then maybe we could talk.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: I want to talk too, Kevin, about another number that I know you and the President disagree with, but that Democrats and many Republicans are worried about, and that's the CBO's projection that as many as 12 million Americans could lose Medicaid coverage because of this law. What is the NEC's estimate for how many people could lose coverage?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Well- well, yeah. Let's- let's unbundle that a little bit. Because, first, on the CBO coverage, so what are we doing? So, what we're doing is we're asking for a work requirement. But, the work requirement is that you need to be looking for work, or even doing volunteer work, and you don't need to do it until your kids are 14 or older. And so, the idea that that's going to cause a massive hemorrhaging in availability of insurance, doesn't make a lot of sense to us. And then, if you look at the CBO numbers, if you look at the big numbers, they say that people are going to lose insurance. About 5 million of those are people who have other insurance. They're people who have two types of insurance. And so, therefore, if they lose one, they're still insured. And so, the CBO numbers on that side don't make any sense to us at all. But, on the other side, go back to 2017 when we had work requirements for Obamacare, they said that we lose about 4 million insured between 2017 and 2019, and about double that over the next 10 years. And, in fact, the number of insured went up. It went up quite a bit, by more than 10 million over those two years, because the bottom line is, the best way to get insurance is to get a job. And we've got a Big, Beautiful Bill that's going to create a lot of job creation and a lot of insurance, and the CBO is just not accounting for that. And again, they need to go back and look at all the things that they got wrong. You realize that they're underestimating Medicaid spending by 20%. They should look back at all the things they got wrong, and explain what they're going to do to get it right in the future, and to do a better job. And if they do that, we'll take them more seriously. But right now, I don't think any serious thinker could take them seriously, because they've done so wrong, and wrong for so long. Even back- if you go back to when President Obama passed Obamacare, they got every single number there wrong about how many people would get private insurance and how few people would get Medicaid, and so on. And so, their record in this modeling space is about as bad as it's possible to be. In fact, you could, kind of, roll the roulette wheel and come up with a better set of numbers, better history, track record than CBO.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin, what about the enhanced subsidies? Is that number wrong too? That the ACA allows about $705 for people to help pay for their health insurance. That doesn't sound like the waste, fraud, and abuse that I know you and the President have talked about eliminating. That just sounds like people who cannot afford coverage, and now it's going to be even more so with the subsidies gone.",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: Right. Well- well, if you're- if you're looking at the- the change in the tax on the providers, which is something that has been a key talking point for the Democrats, they say that that's going to close down rural hospitals. What has happened is that, rather than let the states- the states have this game where they give a dollar to a hospital and then the federal government matches the dollar, and then the state taxes some of the dollar away. In other words, that we have an agreement with the states that they're going to match, but then they have this they have this trick where they tax the hospitals after they give them the money, so really, it's the federal government giving them the money. And that's why we've been overspending Medicaid by 20% since this trick started happening. And so, what we've done is that we've put a haircut on that. But, we've also put $50 billion into a trust fund to make sure that the rural hospitals are there to treat the sick. So, I think this is a prudent form. It's sound budgetary politics. And I think that nobody's going to lose their insurance.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Kevin Hassett, we will watch for how that ages. Thank you very much. Really appreciate --",
      "KEVIN HASSETT: - And if I get it wrong, we'll check, and we'll talk about why I got it wrong. I promise.",
      "WEIJA JIANG: Thank you. We'll have you back. Thank you very much, Kevin.",

      "WEIJIA JIANG: We turn now to New York Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi. Congressman, thank you so much for your time this morning.",
      "REP. TOM SUOZZI: Yeah, thanks so much for having me.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, you just heard from Kevin Hassett- you know, like President Trump, he said, without this bill, it would be one of the greatest tax hikes for the American public. They say it is the greatest tax cut in American history. You sit on the Ways and Means Committee, so I have to wonder how you describe it.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: I describe it as the big, ugly bill, not the 'big, beautiful bill.' It's going to do a lot of things that are going to hurt a lot of people in our country. The biggest one, which you talked about with Mr. Hassett, is increase the deficit enormously in the country. And what that does, is that creates inflation, that keeps interest rates high, that makes it hard for people to buy homes, makes it hard for them to borrow money, to do the things that they want to do. In addition, it's going to knock a bunch of people off of health care. We know the Republicans have tried for a decade to undo the Affordable Care Act- Obamacare, and this is kind of a backdoor way to take health insurance away from people that really need it the most here in our nation. And it's going to cause health insurance costs to go up for a lot of people. One of the President's biggest issues he campaigned on was reducing prices rapidly on day one, we're going to cut the costs. Well, costs are not going down, inflation- inflation is going to be affected by this deficit. Interest rates are going to stay high, and this is going to have a negative impact on health insurance costs for many people in our country.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: I know that you just brought up Medicaid and potential loss of coverage. What do you say to some Americans who might wonder, well, why should the able bodied not have to work in order to access Medicaid?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you have to understand that 92% of the people that are able to work are currently working, and the 8% that are not are often people that are taking care of disabled children. Remember that two thirds of the people in nursing homes are on Medicaid. One-tenth of all the veterans in the United States of America are on Medicaid. Medicaid is a lifeline for so many people that are facing such difficult circumstances that we can't even possibly imagine. And why would we be taking health insurance and food benefits away from some of the most needy Americans while we're providing what I believe is an unnecessary tax break for some of the wealthiest Americans. It just doesn't make sense that you're reducing taxes for some of the wealthiest people, hurting some of the lowest income people, while blowing the biggest deficit in the budget that we've had in the history of the country. Those things just don't add up.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, just last week, you said you agree with 75% of what's in this package, that's a pretty significant number. So why isn't it worth the 25% that you don't like?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Because those things that I just mentioned are so devastating. I like the idea that we're investing more money to secure the border. I like the idea that we are providing tax breaks to lower income folks and hard working middle class folks and people aspiring to the middle class. I like the idea of providing tax breaks for those folks. But why are we providing- and when the economy is doing as well as it has been over the past several years, why would we be providing a tax decrease- tax breaks for some of the wealthiest Americans in our country, while blowing a massive hole in the deficit?",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Congressman, I want to turn to an op-ed that you wrote in The Wall Street Journal last week saying, Zohran Mamdani's win in the New York City's Democratic mayoral primary should be a quote, 'loud wake up call for Democrats.' What lessons do you think your party can learn from- from his campaign?",
      "REP. SUOZZI: Well, you know, I disagree with Mr. Mamdani. I have to make that very clear that, you know, I'm a Democratic capitalist. I'm not a Democratic socialist. And- but you have to recognize that he tapped into something. He tapped into the same thing that Donald Trump tapped into, which is that people are concerned that the economy is not working for them. Affordability and the economy is the number one issue in the country. And too often, Democrats are not perceived as being focused on affordability and the economy and the middle class, and people aspiring to the middle class and their economic concerns. They see Democrats as being primarily focused on reproductive rights and on LGBT protections, which are important issues, but they're not the issues that people think about every night when they're lying in bed thinking about paying their bills or when they're talking about how they're going to send their kids to school. So Democrats have got to do a better job learning from both Trump and Mamdani not with their solutions, which I think are wrong, but with the diagnosis of the problem that we're frustrated, we're concerned. Everybody in America, whether you're a right wing conservative or a left wing progressive, should believe that in return for working hard, you make enough money so you can live a good life. You can buy a home, you can educate your children, you can pay for your health insurance, you can retire one day without being scared. People don't feel that currently, and we have to do a better job of communicating that.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Well, I'm glad you brought up the perception, because you also wrote that 'Democrats must recognize the future starts with a message of economic security for American families.' I covered the Biden campaign. I covered the Harris campaign. That was the center of their messages. So what's the problem here? Is it the messenger? Is it the messaging? Because they have that message already.",
      "REP. SUOZZI: It's a combination. Number- the Democratic Party as a whole has to have this platform that focuses on what the people care about. They care about the economy, they care about immigration, they care about taxes, they care about crime, they care about health care. But then we have to recognize that the media infrastructure is fractured, and Trump figured it out before the Democrats have, which is that it's not just traditional media like your shows and newspapers, but it's social media. It's podcasts. Podcasts, the top 500 podcasts in America, 400 of the top 500 are right leaning. 100 are left leaning. And of the 100 left leaning ones, half of them beat the, you know what, out of the Democrats. Then you have other national media, and then you have some of this ethnic and underground media related to WeChat and WhatsApp and different types of apps that people use. So we have to communicate across all those platforms, because people are getting their messages in these fractured environments and living in these echo chambers, and we have to do a better job communicating across all these platforms and getting Democrats as a whole to focus on the economy, immigration, et cetera.",
      "WEIJIA JIANG: Alright, Congressman, we are all trying to learn all those new languages. Thank you so much for your time this morning. And we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us.",

    "summary": "The Dalai Lama says he'll have a successor, after all, ending years of speculation that he might be the last person to hold the role and meaning he'd be reincarnated.",
    "story": [
      "Dharamshala, India \u2014 The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the centuries-old Tibetan Buddhist institution will continue after his death, ending years of speculation that started when he indicated he might be the last person to hold the role. His having a successor would mean he would be reincarnated.",
      "The Nobel Peace Prize-winning spiritual head of Tibetan Buddhism said at prayer celebrations ahead of his upcoming 90th birthday that the next Dalai Lama should be found and recognized as per past Buddhist traditions, while signaling that China should stay away from the process of identifying his successor.",
      "The Dalai Lama's succession plan is politically consequential for most Tibetans who oppose China's tight control of Tibet and have struggled to keep their identity alive, in their homeland or in exile. It is also profound for Tibetan Buddhists who worship him as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion.",
      "The decision, however, is expected to irk China, which has repeatedly said that it alone has the authority to approve the next religious leader. It insists the reincarnated figure must be found in China's Tibetan areas, giving Communist authorities power over who is chosen.",
      "Many observers believe there eventually will be rival Dalai Lamas \u2014 one appointed by Beijing, and one by senior monks loyal to the current Dalai Lama.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning at a daily news briefing Wednesday said \"the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must adhere to the principles of domestic search in China\" and \"approval by the central government.\"",
      "Mao said the process must \"follow religious rituals and historical settings, and be handled in accordance with national laws and regulations.\"",
      "Tenzin Gyatso became the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama in 1940. He fled Tibet when Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959 and has been living in the town of Dharamshala in India since then, helping establish a democratic government-in-exile while also traveling the world to advocate autonomy for the Tibetan people.",
      "Tibetan Buddhists believe the Dalai Lama can choose the body into which he is reincarnated, as has happened on 14 occasions since the creation of the institution in 1587. He has reiterated in the past that his successor would be born outside China.",
      "The Dalai Lama laid out his succession plan in a recorded statement that was televised at a religious gathering of Buddhist monks in Dharamshala. He said the process of finding and recognizing his reincarnation lies solely with the Gaden Phodrang Trust \u2014 a non-profit he founded in 2015 that oversees matters related to the spiritual leader and the institute of the Dalai Lama.",
      "\"No one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter,\" he said, adding that the search for a future Dalai Lama should be carried out in \"accordance with past tradition.\"",
      "The Dalai Lama has often urged his followers to reject anyone chosen by Beijing. The self-proclaimed Tibetan government-in-exile he once headed before relinquishing his political role in 2011 also supports this stance.",
      "Penpa Tsering, the president of the government-in-exile, said Tibetans from around the world made \"an earnest request with single-minded devotion\" that the position of the Dalai Lama should continue \"for the benefit of all sentient beings in general and Buddhist in particular.\"",
      "\"In response to this overwhelming supplication, His Holiness has shown infinite compassion and finally agreed to accept our appeal on this special occasion of his 90th birthday,\" he said at a press conference.",
      "Tsering, however, warned China not to meddle in the process of the Dalai Lama's succession, saying it is a \"unique Tibetan Buddhist tradition.\"",
      "\"We not only strongly condemn the People's Republic of China's usage of reincarnation subject for their political gain, and will never accept it,\" he said.",
      "The search for a Dalai Lama's reincarnation begins only upon the incumbent's death.",
      "In the past, the successor has been identified by senior monastic disciples, based on spiritual signs and visions, and it can take several years after the next Dalai Lama is identified as a baby and groomed to take the reins.",

      "The next day, Fisher shared an Instagram post in which he thanked Jenner for giving him an unexpected shoutout on social media. Jenner's mother Kris Jenner, 69, then took to the comments to praise Fisher as a \"superstar class act.\"",
      "Kris revealed that Fisher was also her surgeon when she had her first facelift in 2011, which she described as the \"most amazing experience ever.\"",
      "During a 2023 episode of \"The Kardashians,\" Jenner first confirmed rumors that she had breast augmentation surgery after previously denying the speculation. Jenner admitted that she had the procedure at 19, the year before she gave birth to her first child with rapper Travis Scott, daughter Stormi, now 7.

      "\"The myth of the \u2018genetic lottery\u2019 is getting slaughtered \u2013 celebrities are forced to admit their beauty is bought, not purely born,\" the PR expert said. \"Pretending your face is a miracle of DNA is dead \u2013 now it\u2019s all receipts, and surgical invoices.

      "\"Celebrity candor about 445-cc implants isn\u2019t altruism; it\u2019s influencer inventory \u2013 every cubic centimeter reveal pumps the resale value of their own brand merch,\" Schiffer continued. \"Kylie Jenner publishing her implant specs is the new press-release for celebrity plastic surgeons like Dr. Garth Fisher. When Kristin Cavallari live-blogs a rupture revision, she\u2019s not oversharing \u2013 she\u2019s quarantining brand risk before the tabloids weaponize the X-ray.\"",

      "\"The increased transparency from celebrities like Kylie Jenner and Kristin Cavallari about their plastic surgery is certainly driving patient interest, with some specifically requesting \u2018The Kylie Jenner\u2019 or \u2018The Kristin Cavallari\u2019 breast augmentation for their signature enhanced yet natural-looking results,\" he said.",
      "KYLIE JENNER FACES BACKLASH FOR CONTROVERSIAL LION HEAD DRESS",
      "\"This openness helps normalize discussions about cosmetic procedures and empowers patients to explore their options,\" Feldmar added. \"However, expecting identical results to a celebrity\u2019s is often unrealistic due to individual differences in anatomy, healing and lifestyle.\"",
      "\"As surgeons, we guide patients toward personalized outcomes that enhance their unique features while prioritizing safety and realistic expectations, drawing inspiration from celebrity aesthetics without promising an exact replica.\"",

      "Betteridge shared a breakdown of procedures that he believed Karshashian has had, including a face and neck lift, a chin implant, Rhinoplasty, lip filler and more. He shared his view that Kardashian \"looks dramatically different from a few years ago.\" However, Betteridge included the disclaimer that his list was \"purely speculative and based on my professional opinion.\"",
      "\"I have no personal knowledge of any treatments Khloe Kardashian may or may not have had,\" he added.",
      "While Kardashian praised the doctor for the \"great compliment\" in the comments section of his post, she was quick to clarify the work she's actually had done.",
      "\"First off I think these photos are about 15 years apart, But here's a list of things that I have done. I've been very open in the past about what I have done so here we go,\" she continued.",
      "According to Kardashian, she\u2019s had a nose job, \"laser Hair for the hairline and everywhere else,\" \"Botox and sculptra where my face tumor was removed in my cheek,\" \"soft wave laser for skin tightening\" and \"filler in the past but not any over the last few years.\"",
      "Kardashian added that she's \"lost 80 pounds over the years (slow and steady).\"",

      "As more celebrities are coming forward about their cosmetic work, plastic surgeon Dr. Josef Hadeed, who has offices in Beverly Hills and Miami, shared his view on whether their candor would have a lasting impact on the industry.",
      "\"Generally speaking, most people want to look like a better version of themselves,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Certainly, there are some people who do want to look like a certain celebrity or an influencer they have seen on social media, so we may see a temporary uptick in requests for a breast augmentation to look like a certain celebrity who has admitted to having theirs done.\"",
      "\"However, it is not very realistic to look like someone else,\" Hadeed added. \"Every woman starts off with a different breast size, volume, shape and anatomy.\u00a0A good breast augmentation should result in a natural look that compliments the chest and body, and since there are so many options for breast implants, it is important to find the right implant for each patient depending on what her aesthetic goals are.\"",

      "Schiffer\u00a0and Eldridge also shared their opinions on how pulling back the veil on their plastic surgeries would impact celebrities in the eyes of their fans.",
      "\"Confession can be a PR triumph or a social media bloodbath \u2013 there\u2019s no middle ground,\" Schiffer said. \"Some fans applaud the honesty, others see it as normalizing vanity. For each fan who praises transparency, there\u2019s one who calls it a desperate plea for attention.\"",
      "He continued, \"Owning up to surgery humanizes a celebrity \u2013 or expose them as just another insecure narcissist. It\u2019s negative if the work looks botched \u2013 transparency can\u2019t rescue bad art direction on your epidermis.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"You can also think of it as pre-emptive crisis insurance: disclose the nip-tuck details before TMZ finds the OR log, and the headline reads \u2018empowered,\u2019 not \u2018exposed,'\" Schiffer added. \"In the TikTok courtroom, hiding a facelift is securities fraud against your own face.\"",
      "\"Brands love it: a star who posts her surgeon\u2019s handle turns personal downtime into a paid referral pipeline \u2013 affiliate marketing, but with scalpels.\"",
      "PR experts weighed in on whether celebrities' transparency about their plastic surgeries would hurt or help their images. (Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic)",
      "Eldridge told Fox News Digital that the uptick in celebrities' transparency about their plastic surgeries was a \"good move.\"",
      "\"Getting \u2018work done\u2019 is inevitable in Hollywood; until recently, \u2018giving credit\u2019 was not,\" he said. \"As social media continues to be a tool to close the gap between celebrities and their fans \u2013 by providing the illusion of proximity, authenticity and relatability \u2013 then this is the logical \u2018update\u2019 for those apps: candor.\"",

      "Experts were divided over whether the wave of candor was a passing fad. (Chris Polk/Variety/Penske Media via Getty Images)",
      "As for whether the trend would continue, Schiffer told Fox News Digital that he believed \"the transparency arms race has just begun.\"",
      "\"Expect even more grotesque detail and surgical oversharing,\" he said. \"Confession is contagious; each celebrity who comes clean drags a dozen more into the lights.\"",
      "Schiffer continued, \"Transparency is now a competitive sport \u2013 who can be more brutally honest, more raw? This isn\u2019t a trend \u2013 it\u2019s a permanent mutation in celebrity culture. The next frontier is not just admitting surgery, but live-streaming it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence and robotics may help with nursing shortage.",
      "A breakthrough in medical technology could soon change how sinus infections are treated. Scientists have created micro-robots for sinus infection treatment that can enter the nasal cavity, eliminate bacteria directly at the source, and exit without harming surrounding tissue. This drug-free, targeted approach may reduce our dependence on antibiotics.",

      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What are micro-robots for sinus infection treatment?",
      "These microscopic robots are smaller than a speck of dust. They are made of magnetic particles enhanced with copper atoms. Doctors insert them through a narrow duct in the nostril. Once inside, the micro-robots are guided by magnetic fields to reach the infected area.",
      "At that point, a fiber optic light heats the particles and triggers a chemical reaction. This reaction breaks through thick mucus and destroys harmful bacteria at the infection site. As a result, treatment becomes faster, more precise, and far less invasive.",
      "This latest advancement comes from a collaboration of researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, along with universities in Guangxi, Shenzhen, Jiangsu, Yangzhou, and Macau. Their work, published in\u00a0\"Science Robotics,\" has helped move micro-robotic medical technology closer to real-world applications.",
      "Why use micro-robots instead of antibiotics?",
      "Traditional antibiotics circulate throughout the entire body. In contrast, micro-robots target only the infected area. This reduces side effects and lowers the risk of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, patients may recover faster because the treatment goes straight to the source.",
      "A woman with a sinus infection. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Are micro-robots safe?",
      "So far, animal trials have shown promising results. Micro-robots successfully cleared infections in pig sinuses and live rabbits, without causing tissue damage. However, scientists still need to ensure that every robot exits the body after treatment. Leftover particles could pose long-term risks.",
      "In addition, public acceptance remains a challenge. The idea of tiny machines inside the body makes some people uncomfortable. Nevertheless, experts believe those fears will fade over time.",
      "What other uses are possible?",
      "Researchers are already exploring how micro-robots could treat infections in the bladder, stomach, intestines, and bloodstream. Several teams around the world are working to make the technology more advanced and adaptable for deep internal use. If successful, these innovations could revolutionize the way we fight bacteria in the human body.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy addresses virtual private network blocks.",
      "Your personal data is a highly valuable commodity. Companies often treat it like a resource to be mined and traded. In practice, this means that everything you do on the Internet, what you search, what you click, where you shop, feeds a vast industry. Many people feel they have little control over this.",
      "In fact, a Pew Research survey found that roughly six in ten Americans say it's not possible to go through daily life without having data collected about them. We may use \"free\" services, but we usually pay in data. As the U.S. Federal Trade Commission explains,\u00a0\"The things we do throughout the course of our day give businesses access to information about our habits, tastes, and activities. Some might use it to deliver targeted ads to you... Others might sell or share that information\".",
      "Let's examine how your data is collected in everyday life, who is buying and selling it, what happens to it afterward, and, most importantly, what you can do to protect yourself.",

      "A person working on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does your data get collected",
      "Almost everything we do online or even offline can generate data. Here are some common sources:",
      "1) Social media platforms:\u00a0Social networks like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter collect a wide array of data from your posts, likes, location check-ins, connections, and more. Social media companies harvest sensitive data about individuals' activities, interests, personal characteristics, and purchasing habits. In short, even casual sharing on these sites adds to a detailed profile about you.",
      "2) Online shopping and loyalty programs:\u00a0Every time you shop online or use a store loyalty card, data about your purchases is recorded. Retailers track what you buy, when, and how (with coupon or card). Even offline purchases using a rewards card feed into databases. Over time, this builds a detailed purchasing history linked to your identity.",
      "3) Browser fingerprinting: This technique collects bits of information about your browser and device (such as which plugins you have, screen size, time zone, etc.) to create a unique \"fingerprint.\" That fingerprint can identify you uniquely across sites, even without cookies.",
      "4) Mobile app identifiers and SDKs:\u00a0On phones, each app often reports usage data back to its developer or advertising partners. For example, iOS and Android assign a unique advertising ID to your device, and apps can read that ID and log your activity. Many apps also include third-party SDKs (software development kits) from analytics or ad companies that silently collect data on your in-app behavior and send it off for profiling.",
      "5) Cookies and tracking pixels:\u00a0A cookie is a small file your browser saves from a website. It lets the site recognize your device later. A tracking pixel (also called a web beacon) is a tiny, invisible image embedded in a webpage or email that reports back when you view it. Together, cookies and pixels allow companies to \"remember\" your visits, log which pages you view, and build a record of your browsing even after you leave a site.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What data brokers are and how hey sell your information",
      "Data brokers are companies whose entire business is buying, aggregating, and reselling personal information. They collect data about you from many places and bundle it into profiles. This industry is massive (estimated at around $200 billion per year) with thousands of firms globally. Big-name brokers include companies like Experian, Acxiom, Epsilon, and many lesser-known \"people search\" sites.",
      "Using sources like public records, social media, data breaches, and data brokers assemble extensive dossiers on individuals. They collect ordinary details such as names, addresses, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, as well as sensitive traits: gender, marital status, education level, occupation, income range, hobbies, and interests. Brokers may even buy data about your health (like what drugs you purchase) or political views gathered from public voter records or social media activity.",
      "After building these profiles, brokers sell or license them to anyone who will pay. Typical customers include Marketers and Advertisers, Insurers and Lenders, People Search and Data Services, Employers and Background Checkers, and more.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happens to your data after it\u2019s sold",
      "Once your data is in the hands of others, it\u2019s used to profile and segment people in ways that can affect what we see and the opportunities we receive. Profiling simply means grouping people by common traits or habits, such as \"young urban pet owners\" or \"people likely to buy a new car this year.\" These profiles are then used to serve you targeted ads and offers.",
      "Targeted advertising can feel creepy or manipulative. For example, you might notice ads for products you only briefly mentioned in a private message or web search, because your data was shared with dozens of advertisers behind the scenes. Every time you load a page with ads, your data profile is broadcast to companies through automated ad auctions, and they bid to show you ads.",
      "Beyond advertising, there can be more serious consequences such as identity theft and stalking. Broader profiles mean more tempting targets for criminals. People-search websites, which get data from brokers, can show your address, phone number, family members\u2019 names, and even your Social Security number. This information can be used to steal your identity or harass you.",
      "How you can take back control",
      "There are many ways to take control of your personal data, several of which are listed in the section below, but the most effective is to consider a data removal service.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",
      "A personal data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet. It has a very clean interface and will scan 195 websites for your information and remove it and keep it removed.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",

      "A person surfing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4 ways additional ways to protect your data",
      "You can take steps to reclaim some control over your data, and you don\u2019t have to be a tech expert to do it. Here are some practical tips and resources:",
      "1) Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone, and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "2) Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers. You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "3) Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores, and check app permissions.",
      "4) Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide \"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. (Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.)",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "You may not be able to completely escape the data economy, but you can limit its impact on your life. By using privacy tools, being mindful of what you share, and demanding transparency, you make it harder for companies to treat your personal information as a free-for-all. Each small step, whether it's tweaking settings, clicking \"opt out,\" or simply pausing before hitting \"submit\" on a form, helps you regain control. Ultimately, pushing for accountability from businesses and lawmakers is also part of the solution. After all, privacy is a fundamental right that deserves strong safeguards for everyone.",

      "But here's the thing everyone's missing in the panic: these were highly artificial scenarios designed specifically to corner the AI into binary choices. It's like asking someone, \"Would you steal bread if your family was starving?\" and then being shocked when they say yes.",
      "Why this happens (It's not what you think)",
      "The researchers found something fascinating: AI systems don't actually understand morality. They're not evil masterminds plotting world domination. Instead, they're sophisticated pattern-matching machines following their programming to achieve goals, even when those goals conflict with ethical behavior.",
      "Think of it like a GPS that's so focused on getting you to your destination that it routes you through a school zone during pickup time. It's not malicious; it just doesn't grasp why that's problematic.",

      "The researchers themselves noted they haven't seen this behavior in actual AI deployments. This was stress-testing under extreme conditions, like crash-testing a car to see what happens at 200 mph.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "This research isn't a reason to fear AI, but it is a wake-up call for developers and users. As AI systems become more autonomous and gain access to sensitive information, we need robust safeguards and human oversight. The solution isn't to ban AI, it's to build better guardrails and maintain human control over critical decisions. Who is going to lead the way? I\u2019m looking for raised hands to get real about the dangers that are ahead.",

A series of international wire transfers to accounts on the Federal Trade Commission's restricted list has been flagged. There have been reports of suspicious activities associated with your Social Security Number in Texas and New Mexico. We would like to inform you that this document contains sensitive information and should be managed carefully. The document presented here is an official communication from the Social Security Administration, authorized by the Texas Attorney General. The Texas Court has directed the suspension of your Social Security Number due to its association with money laundering activities involving your bank accounts.\"",
      "At first glance, the email looks official enough to cause real panic. It name-drops major authorities like the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Texas Attorney General and the Federal Trade Commission to make the threat sound credible.

They mention multiple states such as Texas and New Mexico, wire transfers and restricted lists, all to create the impression that the situation is deeply serious and far beyond an individual's control.

It's all about creating panic so you'll act before you think. Remember, real government agencies don't send scary emails demanding immediate action, threaten you with arrest or ask for payment in gift cards or wire transfers.

He also reflected on the challenges. According to Goldman, hardware startups require significant time and money to succeed. He found that the robotics ecosystem in France was not mature enough to support such a venture. He also realized that running a tech company and a restaurant simultaneously posed unique challenges. The two industries have different cultures, customer expectations and business models.",

These \"in-between\" moments are where clarity often happens.",

      "Involve someone else:\u00a0Accountability works. Whether it's a friend, partner or roommate, ask someone to check in with you, or even hold the screen time passcode. Just knowing someone else is watching can make mindless scrolling less appealing.",

    "story": [
      "A growing number of fire departments across the country are turning to artificial intelligence to help detect and respond to wildfires more quickly.",
      "The rise of artificial intelligence in education is forcing schools and universities to rethink everything from homework policies to how final exams are administered. With tools like ChatGPT now widespread, students can generate essays, solve complex math problems or draft lab reports in seconds, raising urgent questions about what authentic learning looks like in 2025.",
      "To fight back, some schools are turning to an unlikely solution: pen and paper. The old-school \"blue book,\" a lined booklet used for handwritten test answers, is staging a comeback, according to reporting from The Wall Street Journal. And while it might seem like a relic of a pre-digital era, educators say it's one of the most effective tools they have to ensure students are actually doing their own work.",

      "FOX NEWS AI NEWSLETTER: CHATGPT REWIRING YOUR BRAIN",
      "Exam blue book\u00a0 \u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How common is AI cheating in schools today?",
      "While it's difficult to measure precisely, recent surveys suggest up to 89% of students have used AI tools like ChatGPT to help with coursework. Some admit to using it only for brainstorming or grammar fixes, but others rely on it to write entire papers or take-home tests. As reported, the spike in academic dishonesty has left faculty scrambling to preserve academic standards.",
      "Universities have reported a sharp rise in disciplinary cases tied to AI, but many incidents likely go undetected. Detection software like Turnitin's AI writing checker is being used more widely, but even those tools admit their systems aren't foolproof.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why AI cheating in schools is so hard to detect",
      "One reason this trend is so hard to police is that generative AI has become surprisingly good at mimicking human writing. Tools can tailor tone and style and even match a student's previous work, making plagiarism nearly impossible to identify without sophisticated forensics or human intuition.",
      "In blind tests, teachers have often been unable to distinguish between human and AI-written responses. Making matters worse, some schools that initially tried detection software have started abandoning it due to accuracy concerns and privacy issues.",
      "A student using ChatGPT on his laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why schools are bringing back blue books to stop AI cheating",
      "In response, a growing number of professors are bringing exams back into the classroom, with pen and paper. Schools like Texas A&M, University of Florida and UC Berkeley have all reported surging demand for blue books over the last two years. The logic is simple: If students have to write their essays by hand during class time, there's no opportunity to copy from ChatGPT or another AI assistant. It's not just nostalgia; it's a strategic shift. In-person, handwritten exams are harder to game, and some instructors say the quality of student thinking actually improves without digital shortcuts.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Are handwritten exams enough to stop AI cheating in schools?",
      "Still, not everyone is convinced this is the answer. Critics argue that relying on in-class, timed writing may shortchange students on deeper research skills and analytical thinking, especially for complex topics that benefit from time, revision and outside sources. Plus, blue books do little to prevent AI misuse on homework, group projects or take-home essays.",
      "Should schools ban AI tools or teach responsible use?",
      "Some educators are pushing for a more balanced response: Instead of banning AI tools, teach students how to use them responsibly. That means integrating AI literacy into the curriculum, so students learn where the line is between inspiration and plagiarism and understand when it's appropriate to use tools like ChatGPT or Grammarly.",
      "\"AI is part of the professional world students will enter,\" said one university dean quoted in The Wall Street Journal.\u00a0\"Our job is to teach them how to think critically, even with new tools in hand.\"",
      "A teacher teaching a lesson and a student using her smartphone\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What\u2019s next in the fight against AI cheating in schools?",
      "As AI tools evolve, so will the strategies schools use to ensure honest learning. Some are shifting toward oral exams, where students must explain their reasoning out loud. Others are assigning more process-based work, such as annotated drafts, recorded brainstorming sessions or group projects that make cheating harder. There's no silver bullet, but one thing is clear: the AI genie isn't going back in the bottle, and the education system must adapt quickly or risk losing credibility.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI cheating in education has forced schools to take a hard look at how they assess student learning. The return of the blue book is a sign of just how serious the problem has become and how far educators are willing to go to protect academic integrity. But the real solution will probably involve a mix of old and new, using analog tools like blue books, embracing digital detection methods and teaching students why honest work matters. As AI continues to evolve, education will have to evolve with it. The goal isn't just to stop cheating, it's to make sure students leave school with the skills, knowledge and values they need to succeed in the real world.",

      "Common ways your phone can be hacked and how it happens",
      "You don't need spy-grade tech to hack a phone. The truth is, most phones get compromised not by brute force, but by everyday tricks that prey on users' habits and software gaps.",
      "Phishing is one of the most common methods. This usually involves receiving a fake text, email or even a phone call designed to trick you into clicking a malicious link or sharing sensitive information. It could look like a message from your bank, a delivery service or even a friend.",
      "SIM-swapping is another major threat. In this scam, someone convinces your phone provider to move your number to a SIM card. Once they gain control, they can read your texts, take calls and access accounts that rely on your number.",
      "Malicious apps are also a big risk, especially on devices where users sideload apps or install them from unofficial sources. Some apps appear harmless but are designed to spy on your activity, steal data or give remote access to an attacker.",
      "Public Wi-Fi networks can be another weak spot.\u00a0On an unsecured network, hackers can intercept your data or inject malware into websites. Even Bluetooth can be a vulnerability if it's left on in public. In rare cases, tools exist that allow hackers to connect to your phone without your knowledge, especially if your software isn't up to date.",

      "If your phone is suddenly acting strange, like sending texts you didn\u2019t write, installing apps you don\u2019t recognize or draining your battery much faster than usual, it could be a sign that something is wrong. Unexpected pop-ups, background noise during calls or your phone heating up even when idle can also be red flags.",
      "Another clue is if your contacts start getting messages or calls from you that you didn\u2019t send. This might mean someone has access to your messaging apps or social media accounts. If you\u2019re locked out of accounts linked to your phone number, or if your mobile service suddenly stops working, it could point to SIM swapping.",

Always double-check the sender\u2019s email address or phone number before clicking links or downloading attachments. Even though smartphones have built-in security, installing a trusted antivirus app adds an important extra layer of protection. Strong antivirus software can scan your device for malware, spyware and other malicious programs that might be lurking unnoticed. It can also provide real-time protection by warning you before you download dangerous files or visit risky websites.",

Developers release updates not only to add new features but also to patch security flaws that hackers can exploit. Ignoring updates leaves your device vulnerable to attacks, so make it a habit to install them as soon as they become available.",
      "Two-factor authentication is one of the simplest and most effective ways to protect your accounts. With 2FA enabled, logging in requires two steps: your password plus a second verification method like a code sent to your phone. This extra step makes it much harder for hackers to break into your accounts, even if they have your password.",

      "Public Wi-Fi networks are often unsecured and can be hot spots for hackers trying to intercept your data.

      "Contact your mobile provider and set up a PIN or port-out protection for your account. This prevents scammers from transferring your number without your permission, a key defense against SIM swapping.",
      "Take time to review all the apps installed on your phone. Uninstall anything you don't recognize, no longer use or that seems suspicious. Hackers often hide malware inside seemingly harmless apps or files, so clearing these out can stop threats before they escalate. It's a simple but powerful step to help secure your device.",
      "If your phone has been compromised, it's possible that your personal information, like your name, address, phone number or email is already being shared or sold online. Hackers often collect this data to commit identity theft or launch targeted phishing attacks. A personal data removal service can scan data broker sites and request your information be deleted, reducing your risk of further exposure. These services offer ongoing monitoring to help you stay protected even after a hack.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "If your phone continues to act strangely after you\u2019ve tried other fixes, a factory reset on your iPhone or Android might be necessary. This process erases all data and settings, essentially giving you a fresh start. Before doing this, back up your important files, photos and contacts because a factory reset will delete everything on your device. Once reset, reinstall only trusted apps to reduce the risk of reinfection.",
      "Note: While a factory reset removes most malware, extremely advanced spyware may persist. If you suspect this level of compromise, consult a cybersecurity expert or consider replacing the device.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Phone hacking may seem like something that only happens in movies or to high-profile individuals, but the truth is anyone can be a target. Most attacks rely on simple tricks and human error, not advanced hacking skills. That\u2019s why staying alert, keeping your software up to date and following good security habits can go a long way in protecting your device.",

      "A woman using the Capsule Interface to control a humanoid robot\u00a0 (H2L)",
      "Advanced muscle displacement sensors: The heart of the capsule interface",
      "At the core of the Capsule Interface are sophisticated muscle displacement sensors. Unlike conventional teleoperation systems that rely on motion sensors or exoskeletons, H2L's sensors detect even the smallest changes in muscle tension. This allows the device to capture both the intent and the effort behind every movement.",
      "When you lift, push or grasp, the system measures how much force you're applying, transmitting that data to a remote robot in real time. The result is a more authentic, responsive and natural interaction between human and machine.",

      "Seamless remote operation: Comfort meets control",
      "The Capsule Interface is designed for comfort and accessibility. It can be integrated into chairs or beds, allowing you to operate robots while sitting or lying down. There's no need for bulky wearables or complicated training. Instead, you simply move your limbs, and the system instantly records and communicates those movements and the associated muscle activity. Equipped with a display and speakers, the interface also provides real-time audiovisual feedback, creating a two-way connection that feels intuitive and engaging.",
      "A woman using the Capsule Interface\u00a0 (H2L)",
      "Real-world applications: From business to disaster response",
      "In business, professionals can attend meetings or perform tasks in distant locations by operating a humanoid robot from home or a nearby office. Delivery workers can remotely carry heavy loads, reducing physical strain. The Capsule Interface also has significant potential for disaster response, enabling operators to control robots in hazardous environments without risk to human life. In everyday life, it can assist with household chores, support elderly family members and help farmers manage agricultural robots remotely.",
      "The future of body sharing: Expanding sensory feedback",
      "Looking ahead, H2L plans to make the Capsule Interface even more realistic by adding a new feature called proprioceptive feedback. In simple terms, this means the device would not only let you control a robot, but also allow you to feel what the robot is doing, like sensing resistance when lifting something heavy or feeling the texture of an object through the robot.",
      "By giving you this kind of physical sensation, the experience becomes much more lifelike, making remote collaboration and communication feel even more natural and engaging. This upgrade could unlock new possibilities in areas like education, healthcare and entertainment, where a true sense of touch and movement can make a big difference.",

      "There has been little change in U.S. energy consumption over the past decade. Increased efforts to make energy use more efficient have kept levels low. But over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. Some estimates show the facilities are expected to require as much energy in 2030 as the entire country of Japan does today.",
      "\"Every investor is lining up to invest in the next AI breakthrough. But when it comes to energy, there is a challenge in terms of permitting, the reality of construction timelines for new power plants and new grid capabilities,\" said senior advisor with the Wadhwani A.I. center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"All of this could slow down A.I. just as the research and development is preparing for takeoff.\"",
      "The demand from tech firms comes amid skepticism from consumers. According to a Fox News Poll on how voters felt about A.I. in society, 43% saw it as a good thing, while 47% thought it was a bad thing.",
      "\"I think it's natural that people will always have, call it a mixture of hopes and anxieties about what a new technology, including any new technology and especially AI may bring,\" Microsoft President Brad Smith said. \"The truth is we all rely on AI already, even if we don't think about it.\"",

      "Over the next five years, demand for electricity to power data centers is expected to more than double. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "While positive views have increased faster than negative views, according to polling from 2023, subgroups surveyed expressed opinions all over the board. Most rural voters, White voters, women and those over the age of 45 viewed A.I. as a bad thing. Urban voters, non-White voters, men and those younger than 45 viewed the technology as good. Among major political parties, registered Republicans were most optimistic about A.I. but no party\u2019s approval was above 50%.",
      "Despite the somewhat negative sentiment of most voters, tech companies are powering on.",
      "\"A.I. relies on a lot of what we call compute. A lot of chips that do a lot of calculations and a lot of data that is accessed and is stored. So all of that requires more electricity. And it's why we have to pursue new partnerships as we are with the kinds of companies that generate electricity,\" Smith said.",
      "At least two nuclear plants are scheduled to restart thanks to big tech partnerships.",
      "\"I think this will all become an increasing part of the nation's electricity future,\" Smith said. \"It only makes sense for a power company to invest, to bring something like Three Mile Island back online if it has a guarantee that somebody's gonna purchase it. And so in this case, Microsoft entered into a long-term advanced purchase agreement with Constellation.\"",

      "Three Mile Island is located near Pennsylvania\u2019s capital, Harrisburg. The site is most widely known for its Unit 2 reactor\u2019s partial meltdown in 1979. It was one of the most serious nuclear accidents in U.S. history. The reactor was immediately taken offline in the aftermath.",
      "\"Very small traces of radioactivity have been released from the plant,\" said Metropolitan Edison Vice President John \"Jack\" Herbein at the time.",
      "While there were no detectable health effects, the incident changed how nuclear plants operate. Three Mile Island Unite 1 closed in 2019 for economic reasons. Constellation and Microsoft plan to restart the reactor as early as 2027 at what is now called Crane Energy Center. It will add more than 800 megawatts of energy. That\u2019s enough to power more than 800,000 homes. Nuclear power has the highest energy efficiency rate, yet energy producers say the U.S. should remain diversified.",

      "\"I think it's going to be an important part of the mix,\" Constellation President and CEO Joseph Dominguez said. \"We don't need 24/7 power for the full amount of electricity in the U.S. We still have seasonal needs, we still have day and night differences.\"",
      "Microsoft is working to add the amount of power back to the grid that the company\u2019s data centers will use from the regional transmission system.",
      "\"Our philosophy as a company is that we will invest to bring onto the electric grid as much or more power than we will consume,\" Smith said. \"We will do that in a way that ensures that none of the neighbors are going to see rise in their electricity rates.\"",
      "Constellation is also partnering with Meta to relicense its Clinton Clean Energy Center in central Illinois for another 20 years.",

Amazon will build two data center complexes in Pennsylvania and use nearly two gigawatts of electricity from Talen Energy\u2019s nuclear plant. Google is partnering with Elementl Power on three nuclear projects, each expected to produce 600 megawatts.",
      "\"This is all nuclear. It's a hot industry. It's a brilliant industry,\" President Donald Trump said as he signed several executive orders in May. Those are intended to quadruple domestic nuclear power production within the next 25 years.",
      "\"To win the AI race, we're going to need a lot of energy,\" White House A.I. and Crypto Czar David Sacks said. \"The new AI data centers are very power hungry. They consume a lot of electricity. And the U.S. electric grid really hasn't grown very much over the past decade.\"",

      "At the center of the controversy is the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC), a company jointly owned by several of the largest U.S. airlines, including Delta, American Airlines and United. ARC\u2019s core business includes managing ticket settlements between airlines and travel agencies. However, under a lesser-known initiative called the Travel Intelligence Program (TIP), ARC collects and monetizes vast amounts of data from domestic flight bookings. This includes names, complete itineraries and payment details.",
      "Internal government records and procurement documents reveal that Customs and Border Protection (CBP), part of the Department of Homeland Security, has purchased access to ARC's TIP data to track individuals of interest across the U.S. While CBP maintains that this data supports criminal and administrative investigations, critics argue that the arrangement raises major privacy concerns.",
      "The data is shared without travelers' knowledge or consent, and ARC reportedly requested that the agency keep its identity confidential unless legally required to disclose it.",
      "The documents confirm that CBP\u2019s initial contract with ARC began in June 2024. It has already been extended and may continue through 2029. Although the initial amounts seem modest, around $11,000 with a recent $6,800 update, the implications are far-reaching.",

The system can be queried by name, credit card or even travel agency. Importantly, it does not include data from tickets purchased directly through airline websites, focusing instead on bookings made via travel agencies, such as Expedia.",

      "The DHS has justified its use of TIP data in a public Privacy Impact Assessment, noting the program helps in active investigations.

      "If you want to take back control of your personal information, here are six smart steps you can take right now to reduce your exposure to data brokers.",
      "1. Book flights directly on airline websites:\u00a0Whenever you can, avoid using third-party travel sites like Expedia, Orbitz or travel agencies. These platforms are the main sources of the data collected by the Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) through its Travel Intelligence Program. When you book directly on an airline\u2019s official website or mobile app, your data is far less likely to be shared with ARC or sold to government agencies. While it might be tempting to look for deals on aggregator sites, once you find a fare you like, try to book it directly through the airline.",
      "2. Use virtual or disposable credit cards:\u00a0The ARC system allows queries by credit card number, which means your travel activity can be tracked even if your name is not directly searched. To protect yourself, consider using a virtual credit card or a disposable card number for flight bookings. These are often available through banking apps or fintech services like Revolut, Privacy.com or certain American Express accounts. Virtual cards are tied to your main account but generate a temporary number that can only be used once or at a specific merchant. This makes it much harder for brokers to link future bookings to you.",
      "3. Share the bare minimum when booking:\u00a0Be cautious about the personal information you enter during the booking process. Unless it is legally required, avoid adding unnecessary details like your frequent flyer number, passport data for domestic flights or secondary phone numbers. You can also create a separate email address specifically for travel bookings to reduce the risk of cross-linking data with your other online accounts.

      "4. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete",
      "5. Use a privacy-focused browser and email service: Prevent tracking at the source by using privacy-first tools. Switch to browsers like Brave, Firefox or DuckDuckGo, which block ads and data collectors by default. Set up a separate, secure alias email address for booking travel using services. This limits how easily brokers can link your travel data to your online identity. See my review of the best secure and private email services by\u00a0visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Mail",
      "6. Use an identity theft protection service:\u00a0If your travel or payment data is ever leaked or abused, freezing your credit can help prevent identity theft. Identity theft companies can assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. They can also monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.",
      "One of the best parts of my No. 1 pick is that is it has identity theft insurance of\u00a0up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a\u00a0U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.

      "This new system allows robots to complete complex tasks without relying on a cloud connection. Known as Gemini Robotics On-Device, the model brings Gemini's advanced reasoning and control capabilities directly into physical robots. It is designed for fast, reliable performance in places with poor or no internet connectivity, making it ideal for real-world, latency-sensitive environments.",

It can understand natural language, perform fine motor tasks and generalize from very little data, all without requiring an internet connection. According to Carolina Parada, head of robotics at Google DeepMind, the system is \"small and efficient enough\" to operate directly onboard. Developers can use the model in situations where connectivity is limited, without sacrificing intelligence or flexibility.",

The system delivers faster response times and fewer points of failure, opening up new possibilities for robot deployment in real-world settings.",
      "Safety requires developer input",
      "The on-device model does not include built-in semantic safety features. Google recommends that developers build safety systems into their robots using tools like the Gemini Live API and trusted low-level controllers. The company is limiting access to select developers to better study safety risks and real-world applications. While the hybrid model still offers more overall power, this version holds its own for most common use cases and helps push robotics closer to everyday deployment.",

      "1. Know the signs of a scam: Fake Amazon emails often try to scare you or tempt you into clicking by using familiar tricks. You might see a message claiming your account has been locked, offering a gift card or refund, confirming an order you never placed, or asking you to verify payment details or login credentials. These tactics are meant to create urgency or curiosity. It\u2019s important to remember that Amazon will never ask for your password, banking information, or gift card codes by email.",
      "2. Double-check every message: If something feels off, don\u2019t click anything. Instead, visit Amazon.com or open the app to check your order history and account messages. If the email doesn\u2019t appear in your Amazon Message Center, it\u2019s not real. Also hover over the sender\u2019s name to see the full email address. Genuine messages come from @amazon.com and may show the Amazon smile logo if your inbox supports it.",
      "Genuine email sent from @amazon.com\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. Avoid clicking on unknown links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Phishing emails often contain links that appear to lead to Amazon but actually take you to fake websites designed to steal your information. Instead of clicking, it\u2019s safer to type amazon.com directly into your browser to verify any claims. For added protection, consider using antivirus software that can detect scam links, block dangerous sites, and alert you to phishing emails or ransomware threats. This extra layer of security helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "4. Reduce your exposure to scammers:\u00a0Phishing emails often originate from personal information found on public databases, people-search sites, and data broker platforms. To limit how often you're targeted, consider using a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services by visiting here\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Delete.",
      "5. Report suspicious emails: If you receive a phishing message pretending to be from Amazon, report it right away. This helps Amazon investigate the scam and improve their ability to block similar messages in the future. You can forward the suspicious email to stop-spoofing@amazon.com, or submit it through Amazon\u2019s official reporting form.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Scam emails that pretend to be from Amazon are getting more realistic, but there are still clear ways to protect yourself. Use the Message Center to confirm any message tied to your account. Always double-check the sender's address, look for the smile logo in your inbox when supported, and never click on links unless you're certain they're safe. A few quick habits can go a long way in keeping your personal information secure.",

      "What makes the Govy AirCab a game-changer in urban mobility",
      "The Govy AirCab stands out for its innovative use of carbon fiber, which keeps the vehicle lightweight and efficient. Its design features gull-wing doors and a top-mounted rotor, combining futuristic style with practical function. Thanks to advanced battery technology, the AirCab can fully recharge in just 25 minutes, or reach 50 percent charge in only 15 minutes.

      "Certification and future outlook for the Govy AirCab",
      "Currently, the Govy AirCab is undergoing certification and participating in trial runs.

      "That future, experts believe, lies in a non-Hamas technocratic government \u2013 comprised of Palestinians unaffiliated with either Hamas or the PLO \u2013 backed by a coalition of key Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and the UAE.",
      "\"While a new administration in Gaza should be independent, some\u00a0symbolic link to the Palestinian Authority\u00a0could enhance its\u00a0legitimacy\u00a0with the Arabs.\u00a0Perhaps\u00a0Ramallah\u00a0could serve as a pass-through for paying salaries. But the PA won\u2019t call the shots,\" Hannah said.",
      "\"The default right now, if Israel ends up leaving Gaza, is Hamas,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"There is no one on the ground who can challenge them.

      "\"Without that symbolic PA invitation, Egypt and others won\u2019t come in,\" said al-Omari. \"But they still need a political framework \u2013 some commitment to a two-state solution. Without that, they have absolutely no incentive to play a role in Gaza.\"",

      "For the U.S., the stakes extend far beyond sanctions relief. Schenker said a stable Syria focused on education and social services, rather than military buildup, would be far less fertile ground for ISIS or Iranian influence.",
      "Ali described the current moment as part of a broader Trump strategy: \"Now with Assad gone, it\u2019s another blow to the Islamic Republic of Iran. This creates an opportunity to coalesce the Sunni Arab states \u2013 either around the Abraham Accords or a growing anti-Iran coalition.\"",
      "The U.S. military still maintains a small but critical footprint in Syria \u2013 approximately 1,000 troops across three to four bases in the northeast \u2013 providing vital intelligence and rapid strike capability. \"That footprint has been one of our most important counterterrorism outposts,\" Ali said. \"We\u2019ve seen multiple targeted operations this year alone.\"",

      "Meanwhile, the diplomatic implications of Trump\u2019s move are drawing global attention. Syria\u2019s new leadership has publicly distanced itself from Iran, reportedly blocked Hezbollah weapon shipments, and dismantled multiple Iranian military posts across the country.",
      "\"The president is genuinely focused on expanding the Abraham Accords,\" said Schenker. \"He sees Syria as the next possible candidate.\"",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump is working towards lasting peace in the Middle East, which includes supporting a Syria that is stable, unified, and at peace with itself and its neighbors. The President is empowering Syria\u2019s success by lifting sanctions on export controls while maintaining sanctions on terrorists and all other potential threats to the United States. The President made a promise to give Syria a chance to rebuild and thrive by lifting sanctions, and this President keeps his promises.\"",
      "A masked Islamic State terrorist holds the ISIS flag in 2015. (Pictures from History/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Still, normalization with Israel remains politically fraught. Syria remains officially at war with the Jewish state, and while Sharaa has hinted at accepting the pre-1974 ceasefire lines, jihadist factions and Islamist groups within Syria remain staunchly opposed. \"There have already been reported assassination attempts on Sharaa,\" Schenker said. \"It\u2019s going to get harder if he moves from non-belligerency to full normalization.\"",
      "Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, told Fox News Digital, \"Syria has always been an open wound in the center of the region \u2013 an engine of instability\u2026 But if it stabilizes now, it unlocks a path for broader regional integration.

      "Growing up near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas, could sometimes feel like living near a volcano.",
      "I was born two blocks from the gorgeous river that flows from the Hill Country to the Gulf of Mexico, just one year before the devastating and deadly 1987 flash flood, often described around town as the \u201cbig one.\u201d",
      "As a boy, whenever flash floods inevitably struck our area, which could be every few years, my dad would take me down to the overflowing Guadalupe. From a safe distance, we would watch the power of the water and understand the strength and danger behind it. Living near this jewel of the Hill Country was a blessing, but it came with the knowledge that, like a volcano, when it erupted, things could get incredibly bad, incredibly fast.",
      "For Kerrville locals, the power of the Guadalupe was never in doubt. And yet, what happened in the early hours on Friday, when catastrophic flooding struck with a surge topping 20 feet, soon became a perfect storm turned into a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy.",
      "I first heard about the flood on Friday morning, when I woke up in L.A. to a half-dozen text messages from all over the country asking if my family was safe. I later learned that at around 5 a.m., my mother had evacuated her home on the river, where she had retired, while my stepfather helped multiple families and RVs move out of the way before the powerful floods washed them away.",
      "The entire day was a gut-wrenching waiting game because we had friends who were personally affected by the floods, and nobody knew how they were doing. Communication was limited, and it felt like a heartbreaking nightmare playing out over 24 hours.",
      "Having since moved to the West Coast, I rarely report on Texas. However, I knew I had to get to my hometown because there is no place I would rather be than chronicling every step of this tragedy and telling the stories along the way.",
      "As we enter Day 4 of this unimaginable situation, where the death toll has risen to at least 90 across six damaged counties, I am struck by this incredible mix of grief and grit. And while I know that this community will band together to move forward from this, this level of collective pain is something I have never experienced before.",
      "The nature of this job throws you into disasters all over the world, and in each instance, there is a layer of separation. But when it hits your home, it\u2019s like seeing tragedy for the first time.",
      "I\u2019m fortunate to say that my family is safe, but we have friends who this has personally affected, and those in my community are sorting through the unfathomable. As we cover this story, my purpose here is to connect with the people who are trying to make sense of what happened, to share the stories of resilient residents coming together, and to ask questions so this will not happen again.",
      "As a kid growing up in Kerrville, you learn different ways to help your community, such as being in the Boy Scouts or lending a hand when needed. For my grandfather, it was helping rescue kids in 1987 during the last flooding tragedy.",
      "Now, for me as an adult, it\u2019s coming back to Kerrville to stay in my mother\u2019s home to cover this flood that\u2019s become unlike anything we have ever seen before, and hopefully, nothing we ever see again."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cbd-liver-damage-study-potential-problems-rcna217186",
    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:34:38 GMT",
    "summary": "From capsules, gummies and other edibles, to oils and lotions, CBD products have become increasingly popular in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "A new clinical trial suggests there are still ongoing questions about the safety of even low doses of cannabidiol, even as CBD capsules, gummies, edibles, oils and lotions have become increasingly omnipresent in the United States in recent years.",
      "Scientists from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Division of Applied Regulatory Science carried out a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial last year to assess how low-dose CBD affects liver function in a group of healthy middle-aged men and women.",
      "Over the course of four weeks, 201 volunteers received either 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (approximately 2.3 mg per pound or the equivalent of 350 mg for a 154-pound individual) of oral CBD, or a placebo. The goal was to give them a typical amount that might be used by consumers. Participants also underwent weekly laboratory assessments.",
      "While the vast majority of people in the trial were unaffected, 5% showed greatly elevated levels of the liver enzyme aminotransferase, a known marker of liver cell damage or inflammation, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men. The liver enzyme returned to normal within one or two weeks of stopping CBD.",
      "Seven participants withdrew from the trial because they were showing clinical signs of potential drug-induced liver injury.",
      "The FDA didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant finding, as it suggests that CBD itself, even in the absence of other drugs, may pose a risk to liver health,\u201d says Amir Englund, a researcher at King\u2019s College London who studies cannabinoid psychopharmacology, and was not involved in the new trial. \u201cThe results have important implications for individuals using over-the-counter CBD supplements. Many may be unaware of the potential for liver injury and assume that CBD is entirely benign.\u201d",
      "Between 2014 and 2022, CBD product sales in the U.S. increased from $108 million to $1.9 billion, after a landmark bill passed by the Trump administration in 2018 enabled the unrestricted sale of cannabis products containing less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive element which gets users high.",
      "According to various surveys in recent years, the majority of people in the U.S. have now heard of CBD, and around 20% have reported using CBD products in the past 12 months.",
      "While CBD products  have become a popular way to self-medicate for conditions including pain, anxiety, insomnia and depression, especially among older adults, there\u2019s been little evidence on how well they work or guidance on how to use the products safely.",
      "Symptoms of liver injury",
      "Signs of liver injury include abdominal discomfort, jaundice or yellowing of the skin and eyes, and fatigue.",
      "However, research has shown that drug-induced liver injuries don't always become immediately apparent. In the FDA trial, only one of the participants with elevated liver enzymes noticed any symptoms within four weeks. The authors suggested that users may not realize that they are incurring harm and that doctors should ask about regular CBD use as part of routine medical screening.",
      "\u201cThis was an important observation from the study,\u201d said Paul Watkins, professor of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cWhen doctors get liver chemistry results back and they\u2019re out of whack, they should be aware to ask, \u2018Were you taking CBD?\u2019 Because a lot of people are.\u201d",
      "The new trial is not the first study to suggest potential health risks relating to cannabidiol and its effects on the liver. Such concerns were initially described following an FDA review of clinical trial data on CBD-based prescription drugs for childhood epilepsy, with raised liver enzymes being observed in 14% of participants.",
      "\u201cIn clinical trials involving epilepsy patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes were among the leading causes of withdrawal from the trials due to serious adverse events,\u201d  Englund said \u201cHowever, those participants were concurrently taking other anti-epileptic medications, which could have contributed to the observed liver effects.\u201d",
      "Watkins was subsequently involved in research investigating why CBD can affect liver cells, and he said that certain doses seem to have an effect similar to acetaminophen, or paracetamol.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s also been shown that healthy adults, when they get recurrent therapeutic doses of paracetamol, also have these liver chemistry abnormalities,\u201d Watkins said.",
      "In the U.S., acetaminophen, when taken in excess, is among the most common causes of drug-induced liver injury, also called toxic hepatitis.",
      "In the last few years, research studies have shown that people most at risk of liver injury are those taking very high oral doses of CBD, exceeding 1000 mg per day. There have still been reports of drug-induced liver injuries in some healthy individuals taking moderate doses of anywhere between 300 mg and 1000 mg per day.",
      "Relatively little is known about why some people are more susceptible than others, but it is thought that genetic factors may play a role. According to Englund, CBD can inhibit certain enzymes in the liver which are needed for metabolizing medications.",
      "In the new FDA trial, the majority of participants who experienced the most serious liver problems also developed signs of an immune condition called eosinophilia, which is when the body produces an excess of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils.",
      "The new results emphasize the importance of tracking liver safety as a potential, unintended adverse effect, Englund said.",
      "\u201cGiven the growing interest in CBD as a potential treatment for conditions such as psychosis and cannabis use disorder, these findings underscore the importance of monitoring liver enzyme levels in future clinical trials,\u201d he said.",
      "Overall, Watkins \u2014 who co-chairs the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, a research group backed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health \u2014 still believes CBD is relatively safe.",
      "While over-the-counter supplements are becoming a growing potential cause of significant liver injuries, CBD has yet to be flagged as a source of concern, he said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the liver is very good at adjusting to sources of drug stress [indicated by elevated enzymes],\u201d Watkins said, noting the network hasn't detected a case of serious liver injury attributed to CBD. \"There could be people out there whose liver doesn\u2019t adjust very well, and as companies compete for market share, you might start getting more potent CBD which could push people into the ranges where they\u2019re getting into trouble, but the data we\u2019ve got suggests it\u2019s very safe.\u201d"

But as someone who\u2019s covered Amazon\u2019s mega sale for six years, I guarantee that there\u2019s a method to the madness more often than not. Certain categories historically offer stronger discounts than others, and identifying what they are before you start shopping can help you maximize your budget.",

      "What to buy during Prime Day",
      "If you\u2019re narrowing your shopping list, focus on the categories below to save the most money.",
      "There are various reasons why Amazon hosts Prime Day, but experts say a big one is to sell products from its brands, including Echo, Ring, Blink, Kindle and Amazon Basics. Expect to see many of these brands\u2019 products marked down to their lowest price ever and bundles that let you buy and save on a few that work together.",
      "Amazon Echo Dot",
      "The Echo Dot is a Bluetooth speaker equipped with Amazon Alexa, so you can use voice commands to ask the virtual assistant questions and control compatible smart home devices. The speaker pairs with music streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music, and can double as an alarm clock.",
      "While electronics from Amazon-owned brands are typically discounted the most on Prime Day, plenty of other tech brands slash prices on their gadgets, including Apple, FitBit, Samsung and Sony, says Carls. Focus on items like headphones, Bluetooth speakers, portable chargers, laptops, tablets and e-readers, and smart home devices like indoor and outdoor security cameras, doorbells, garage openers, lights and plugs.",
      "Blink Outdoor 4",

      "Prime Day is not ideal for buying a refrigerator or washing machine. Instead, prioritize small home and kitchen appliances like air purifiers, vacuums and fans, as well as air fryers, blenders and toaster ovens. \u201cTop brands like Instant Pot, Ninja, Keurig and Vitamix are deeply discounted and they rarely go on sale outside of major events,\u201d says Carls.",

      "Apparel deals often fly under the radar during Prime Day, but they\u2019re plentiful, says Carls. Amazon\u2019s in-house brands tend to be discounted the most, like The Drop, Amazon Essentials, Goodthreads and Core 10, and you\u2019ll see promotions at Shopbop and Zappos since the retailer owns both companies. That said, many other clothes, shoe and accessory brands offer great deals, so keep an eye out, especially if you\u2019re looking for basics like white T-shirts, activewear like leggings, sports bras and running shoes, and summer items like sunglasses, bathing suits and shorts.",

This year, 24% of parents with grade-school children and 20% of parents with college students plan to shop for school supplies during Amazon\u2019s mega sale, according to a survey from RetailMeNot. Vipin Porwal, the CEO and a consumer savings expert at Smarty, recommends looking for savings on items like backpacks and lunchboxes, as well as dorm essentials and school-related tech.",

      "You can store everything you need for school, work or travel inside this backpack, which has numerous interior and exterior pockets, as well as a dedicated compartment for your laptop. The backpack\u2019s padded shoulder straps make the bag comfortable to wear, and it has reflective elements so people can always see you in low light.",
      "Before Prime Day starts, walk around your home and take inventory \u2014 are you running low on any essentials? Name-brand laundry detergent, dog food, pantry staples, toilet paper, garbage bags, paper towels and more are all on sale during the event, and since you\u2019ll need them eventually, you may as well buy them at a discounted price.",
      "Duracell Optimum AA Batteries",

      "While you\u2019ll see TVs and gaming-related products on sale during Prime Day,  don\u2019t buy them just yet, says Carls. There are better discounts and bundles closer to the holidays, especially during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Porwal also recommends waiting until Labor Day to purchase furniture, as well as large home and kitchen devices. Three-day holiday weekends are known for their discounts on these types of items, so hold off until Labor Day deals start in mid-August.",
      "Prime Day counter sales to know about",
      "Amazon isn\u2019t the only one hosting a mega sale in the next few days. Savings events are happening at retailers like Target, Walmart and Nordstrom, too. Some attempt to beat Prime Day pricing on select items, while others compete by offering discounts on different types of products. Additionally, many brands are extending their Fourth of July offers online in hopes of Prime Day shoppers spilling onto their sites.",
      "Here are a few Prime Day-adjacent sales to know about.",
      "Target Circle Week runs through Jul. 12 and is only open to Target Circle members. You can join the loyalty program for free. Target tends to offer strong deals on home, fashion and personal care products, especially if they\u2019re from brands it owns, says Carls.

It\u2019s open to all shoppers, but Walmart+ members get early access on Jul. 7 at 7:00 p.m. ET.

During the sale, Nordstrom marks down new fall merchandise, while Prime Day mainly marks down overstock items.Best Buy\u2019s Black Friday in July sale runs through Jul. 13, and it\u2019s open to everyone.

      "Expert tips: How to save money while shopping Prime Day",
      "Go in with a plan: Do your homework, says Carls \u2014 set a budget and list everything you want to buy ahead of time. \u201cThe best approach is to shop with a plan,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in big sale moments, but the real value comes when you buy things you already need, at the right time, with the right offer attached.\u201d",
      "Download the Amazon app and turn on notifications: If you add items to your watchlist before Prime Day, the app notifies you when prices drop so you can jump on them.",
      "Shop Lightning Deals: Lightning Deals only run for a few hours, and there\u2019s limited inventory available \u2014 once the product sells out or the deal expires, it\u2019s gone for good. Lightning Deals are some of the most lucrative discounts brands offer during Prime Day, so pay close attention to them. New offers drop as often as every 10 minutes.",
      "Checkout ASAP: Many items discounted on Prime Day are overstock merchandise that brands want to clear out while they have a massive audience, says Porwal. They list items at historically low prices to move inventory quickly, so if you like something, act quickly. Also, the stronger the discount, the more likely it is to be time-sensitive, and popular products from brands like Apple, Dyson and Sony commonly sell out.",
      "Pay extra attention to featured sales: Deals advertised front-and-center on Amazon\u2019s website and in its app are typically some of the strongest. \u201cThese sellers pay a premium to Amazon to feature their best products, which will likely be available in shorter time frames and at some of their lowest prices ever,\u201d says Porwal.",
      "Browse for new deals daily: This year\u2019s longer Prime Day timeline gives brands more room to roll out deals in phases. Expect to see new deals drop every day, as well as potential restocks, says Carls.",
      "Be wary about unverified sellers: If you\u2019re unfamiliar with a brand or seller, and the product isn\u2019t something you really need, sometimes the savings aren\u2019t worth the risk, says Porwal.",
      "Use price trackers: Those like CamelCamelCamel help you evaluate an item\u2019s price history, which lets you determine if it\u2019s really a good deal or just temporarily marked down from an inflated baseline, says Carls.",
      "Compare prices: An item\u2019s Prime Day price is almost always the lowest across retailers, especially because your purchase ships free. But it\u2019s always a good idea to compare prices before you check out just in case, says Porwal.",
      "Familiarize yourself with return policies: Amazon doesn\u2019t have a special return policy for Prime Day purchases, but you know how long you have to return an item if needed.",
      "Will tariffs impact Prime Day deals?",
      "In response to the 10% tariff on all countries that\u2019s been in effect since April, some brands have already raised prices on their products. Experts say this trend will continue, especially because the 90-day pause on higher reciprocal tariffs ends in a few days. But that doesn\u2019t mean Prime Day deals will be weaker this year, experts say. Some brands are increasingly leaning into deals to drive sales before higher costs force price adjustments later. \u201cFor shoppers, this might be the right moment to buy higher-priced items that could become more expensive in the fall,\u201d she says.",
      "While deals won\u2019t necessarily be weaker during Prime Day 2025, how brands present them might look a little different, says Carls. Expect blanket markdowns, like 30% off every single product a company sells on Amazon, and more curated promotions, meaning a few deeply discounted items. Some brands will also opt for time-sensitive deals rather than keeping products on sale for all four days of the event.",

      "\u201cDiddy basically gets off while Rachel and I get convicted for what could be twenty years,\u201d Daedone said in a statement given exclusively to NBC News, referring to former company executive and co-defendant Rachel Cherwitz. \u201cThat should tell you everything you need to know about how we (society) view women\u2019s sexuality.\u201d",
      "Last month, a federal jury in Brooklyn found Daedone and Cherwitz guilty of forced labor conspiracy. Federal prosecutors in New York alleged in their indictment that they targeted victims of trauma to become members of their company and manipulated them into performing sex acts and going into debt, among other things. The government said the two women \u201ccoerced their victims to sexually service OneTaste\u2019s current and prospective investors, clients and employees.\u201d Daedone and Cherwitz denied the claims.",
      "They are currently in jail awaiting their sentencing, which is scheduled for September. They face up to 20 years in prison.",
      "\u201cThe case operated at an emotional level, not a legal or rational one. It made perfect sense to me: a self-possessed sexual woman is presumed guilty; in the current culture she can never be proven innocent,\u201d Daedone said.",
      "Prosecutors declined to comment on Daedone\u2019s statement.",
      "Daedone founded women\u2019s wellness company OneTaste in 2004 and grew it into a $12 million business with thousands of followers, winning celebrity fans such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Khloe Kardashian. But an explosive 2018 Bloomberg article and a subsequent 2022 Netflix documentary \u201cOrgasm Inc.\u201d featured former employees who said they were subjected to a toxic environment. Daedone and Cherwitz, who had been head of sales for the company, were indicted in 2023.",
      "Daedone said her conviction is unjust in comparison to hip hop mogul Combs\u2019 acquittal last week on charges of sex trafficking and racketeering. Combs was convicted by a Manhattan federal jury of two lesser charges of transportation to engage in prostitution. His attorneys called the verdict \u201ca victory\u201d after prosecutors for seven weeks painted him as the leader of a criminal enterprise who sex trafficked two of his former girlfriends.",
      "The prostitution crimes carry maximum sentences of up to 10 years each, but experts don\u2019t expect him to receive that much.",
      "Maurene Comey, who led the team of prosecutors in Combs\u2019 trial, repeatedly played the security footage of Combs brutally beating Cassie Ventura at a Los Angeles hotel in 2016. Prosecutors told jurors that Combs used violence, drugs and blackmail to force Ventura and another girlfriend known as \u201cJane,\u201d to have sex with male escorts in drug fueled encounters he dubbed \u201cfreak offs.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Border Patrol's Border Search, Trauma, and Rescue (BORSTAR) has been deployed to assist with the recovery effort, according to Border Patrol Chief Tom Homan.",
      "Some Texas officials have been critical of the National Weather Service, saying forecasts underestimated the rainfall that caused furious floods. Independent meteorologists and a former NWS official said the warnings issued in the run-up to the flooding were as timely and accurate as could be expected, given the real-time data available. Predicting extreme rain and flash flooding beyond several hours is challenging, they said, and it is also difficult to ensure that urgent warnings reach those most at risk.",
      "On Sunday, Trump rejected the idea of investigating whether NWS cuts had left key vacancies, and the White House said claims that NWS staffing cuts had anything to do with the tragedy were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d",

      "Other areas of the country are bracing for heavy rain. Flood watches are in place from eastern Virginia through northern New Jersey, including Baltimore and Philadelphia, as Tropical Depression Chantal moves into the mid-Atlantic. Rainfall of 1 to 2 inches could cause flash flooding in urban areas. On Sunday, Chantal brought flooding to parts of North Carolina, where more than 10 inches was recorded near the Chapel Hill area.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been hit hard in Canada with tariffs and there\u2019s been a real sense of patriotism up here. So, we ultimately decided to explore our own country, and do a road trip to the Rockies and spend money within Canada to help our economy,\u201d Sharp said.",
      "Sharp\u2019s change in plans reflects a larger trend of international travelers rethinking where they are spending their travel budgets and pulling back on visits to the U.S.",
      "The number of foreign visitors to the U.S. by air dropped 10% in March from a year prior, according to the International Trade Administration, part of the Commerce Department. Including land border crossings, the number of inbound visitors to the U.S. fell 14% in March from the same period last year, according to industry group U.S. Travel Association.",

      "The company said it had a 22% increase in bookings in blue states and a 9% decline in red states during that time period. It also saw declines in cities within red states including Salt Lake City, Phoenix, and Austin, Texas.",
      "Misterb&b CEO Matthieu Jost said overall bookings on the platform are not down globally but are increasing. LGBTQ+ individuals appear to be continuing to spend on vacations, but they\u2019re changing their destinations, Jost said.",

      "The rainbow dollar",
      "Sharp, who owns LGBTQ-friendly travel company Out Adventures, is not alone in changing his travel plans.",
      "In February, the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Egale Canada issued a statement saying its members would not participate in person at conferences or events happening in the U.S. this year, including WorldPride, which took place at the beginning of June in Washington, D.C.",
      "The decision was made primarily to protect individuals\u2019 safety, said Helen Kennedy, executive director of Egale Canada.",
      "In his second term, Trump has signed several executive orders targeting transgender people, including preventing them from serving openly in the military and trying to keep transgender athletes out of girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports.",
      "Another executive order, which says the federal government recognizes only two sexes, male and female, prompted several countries, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, to issue official cautions for LGBTQ+ travelers visiting the U.S., particularly transgender travelers. Canada has also updated its travel guidance with specific advisories for people with an \u201cX\u201d gender listed on their passports.",
      "Kennedy said another reason for the decision not to travel to the U.S. was to push back on what she views as \u201ceconomic warfare\u201d from the U.S. toward Canada.",
      "\u201cPeople talk about Canada and the U.S. having a long history of being incredible neighbors. And yes, we do, but that\u2019s based on economic interests a lot of the time,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWhen you put that human element with the economic element, then you think, well, OK, why would I go there?\u201d",
      "Kennedy said members of Egale Canada who are involved in nongovernmental organizations would normally spend anywhere from $3,000 to $5,000 per person during a trip to attend a conference or event. Corporate travelers usually spend at least $5,000, she estimated.",
      "\u201cWe do spend a fair chunk of change in hotels,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do excursions, we rent bikes, we do all of the things that everybody else does.\u201d",
      "The LGBTQ+ travel market is significant. The purchasing power of LGBTQ+ consumers overall is estimated to be $1.4 trillion, according to a 2022 study by the market research firm Pride Co-Op.",

      "Research from Arival Travel shows that LGBTQ+ travelers are more likely to be affluent, with a household income of over $150,000, compared with other travelers.",
      "When traveling, LGBTQ individuals book more activities and tours and spend more on these experiences than other populations, the Arival research found.",
      "John Tanzella, CEO of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, said his organization is already sensing a pullback in international LGBTQ+ travel to the U.S. He said he has heard hesitations from international members about attending the organization\u2019s global convention in October in Palm Springs, California.",

      "\u201cOn the surface, it affects airlines and hotels. But if you dig a little deeper it does affect other businesses, whether it\u2019s barber shops or restaurants, bars, spas. A lot of communities rely on tourists to come in and spend their money,\u201d he added.",
      "Pride celebrations carry on",
      "Despite concerns of waning visits from international LGBTQ+ travelers, as well as some pullbacks in corporate sponsorships for Pride celebrations, Pride organizations across the U.S. said attendance was strong at Pride Month events, many of which take place on the last weekend of June.",
      "But many organizations said it\u2019s still too soon to get official attendance numbers or difficult to estimate, given that many Pride celebrations are non-ticketed and open to the public.",

      "He said NYC Pride lost approximately 25% of its corporate sponsorships initially this year, due to the economy, tariffs and pullback surrounding diversity, equity and inclusion. But he estimated the number of people and contingents participating in the Pride march this year will be bigger than in previous years.",
      "Ryan Bos, executive director for the Capital Pride Alliance, which ran WorldPride this year, said organizers were \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d that people still showed up amid concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s policies.",
      "Bos said he had heard calls to cancel the event this year due to political tensions in Washington, he said.",
      "\u201cIf we were to retreat, what message would that have sent to all the other Prides who are also experiencing similar challenges?\u201d Bos said.",
      "While WorldPride doesn\u2019t have official attendance numbers yet, Bos said he believes attendance was strong. However, Tanzella, of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, said he heard numbers for WorldPride were down this year.",
      "Cities in red states have also continued on with their pride celebrations.",
      "Attendance rose from about 28,000 last year to 33,000 this year at Phoenix Pride\u2019s annual Rainbows Festival in April, Executive Director Michael Fornelli told CNBC in a statement. Its Pride parade will be celebrated in October due to the summer heat.",
      "In Salt Lake City, SLC Pride estimated its celebration last weekend brought in 17,000 attendees, more than the 10,000 it saw last year, according to Bonnie O\u2019Brien, festival director.",

      "Some of these areas had already experienced slow-moving storms Monday morning, but more were expected throughout the day. These storms are likely to drop another 2-4 inches of rain onto an already saturated region. Some localized areas could see 6 inches or more. Conditions are expected to improve Tuesday as stagnant, high-moisture weather systems finally move toward the east.",
      "Some regions in the mid-Atlantic are also facing risks of flooding. On Sunday, Tropical Storm Chantal flooded parts of North Carolina, where more than 10 inches of rain fell near the Chapel Hill area. The Haw River, near Bynum, North Carolina, crested to nearly 22 feet, the highest crest on record there, as a result of those heavy rains.",

      "Experts also warned that coastal regions could experience other weather-related threats, like strong surf and rip currents.",
      "Warm temperatures are hitting other parts of the U.S. Some 30 million people in the Northeast \u2014 including in Philadelphia; Boston; Hartford, Connecticut; Albany and Rochester, New York; and Burlington, Vermont \u2014 were under heat alerts.",
      "Temperatures in the high 80s and 90s were expected in some places, with maximum heat index reaching 100 in Philadelphia.",
      "But the nation's focus remains mostly on Texas. As of midafternoon Monday, at least 90 people had been confirmed dead from the weekend storms. Flash flood warnings over the long weekend were issued when most people were sleeping and unlikely to respond. Thousands of people were left scrambling.",
      "Storms can stall over land, dropping heavy rains that can result in major flooding, as happened over the weekend in Texas' Hill Country. Overnight on Thursday and Friday, heavy showers fell across Central Texas, exceeding 20 inches in some places. On Saturday, stalled storms prompted a flash flood emergency overnight. Some areas experienced swells of up to 2 feet of water.",
      "In 2017, Hurricane Harvey hovered over Houston for days, drenching the city and surrounding metro areas with nearly 50 inches of rain amounting to trillions of gallons of water. The storm caused billions of dollars in damage."

      "With Roger Federer, an eight-time Wimbledon winner, sitting in the front row of the Royal Box, so little went right at the outset for the 38-year-old Djokovic on the grass below during a breezy afternoon with the temperature in the 60s Fahrenheit (teens Celsius), a week after matches were contested in record-breaking heat.",

      "His bid for an eighth Wimbledon title and 25th Grand Slam singles trophy overall will continue against No. 22 Flavio Cobolli of Italy. Cobolli reached his first major quarterfinal with a 6-4, 6-4, 6-7 (4), 7-6 (3) victory over 2014 U.S. Open champion and two-time major runner-up Marin Cilic.",
      "Djokovic will be appearing in his 63rd Slam quarterfinal.",
      "Against de Minaur, he made mistake after mistake, double-faulting four times in the first set alone. By match\u2019s end, he had faced a hard-to-believe 19 break points.",
      "After entering with 41 holds in 42 service games in the tournament, Djokovic was broken in five of his first seven against de Minaur, a 26-year-old Australian who was supposed face the Serb in last year\u2019s quarterfinals at Wimbledon but withdrew with an injured hip.",

      "All in all, Djokovic was discombobulated, chalking it up afterward to nerves. He rushed between points. He reacted to flubbed shots by rolling his eyes or shouting and glaring in the direction of his guest box or putting his arms wide as if seeking explanations from someone, anyone.",
      "At changeovers, he placed an ice-filled towel \u2014 usually wrapped around necks by players in steamy conditions \u2014 on his stomach, which he complained about during his first-round victory last week. But afterward, Djokovic dismissed the significance of that.",
      "This could have been Djokovic\u2019s soonest setback at Wimbledon since he was eliminated in the third round by Sam Querrey nine years ago. That one was even more shocking, because it ended Djokovic\u2019s 30-match Grand Slam winning streak, which included championships at the preceding four major tournaments in a row, making him the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold each of those trophies simultaneously.",
      "Djokovic won his men\u2019s-record 24th major title at the 2023 U.S. Open.",
      "He\u2019s come close to raising his total, finishing as the runner-up to Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon last year \u2014 the second consecutive time they met in the final, with the results the same \u2014 and departing each of the first two Slams of 2025 in the semifinals: he stopped with a hurt hamstring at the Australian Open in January and lost to No. 1 Jannik Sinner at the French Open last month.",

      "The comeback officially was on, and soon enough, he was closing the third set with a winner to cap a 27-shot point.",

      "Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations.",
      "Expressing displeasure with the EU\u2019s stance in trade talks, however, Trump said he would increase the tariff rate for European exports to 50%, which could make everything \u2014 from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals \u2014 much more expensive in the U.S.",
      "The EU\u2019s executive commission, which handles trade issues for the bloc\u2019s 27-member nations, said its leaders hope to strike a deal with the Trump administration.

      "EU sells more to the US than vice versa",

      "However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services.",
      "The U.S. services surplus took the nation\u2019s trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade.",
      "What are the issues dividing the two sides?",
      "Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU\u2019s averaged 1.35% for American products.",
      "But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration\u2019s 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts.",
      "Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef.",
      "Trump has also criticized Europe\u2019s value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren\u2019t on the table during trade negotiations.",
      "\u201cOn the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,\u201d Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany\u2019s Berenberg bank, said. \u201cThey cannot change the way they run the EU\u2019s vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.\u201d",
      "'Consequence for many companies'",
      "Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers.",
      "Mercedes-Benz dealers in the U.S. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices \u201cuntil further notice.\u201d The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo \u201csignificant increases\u201d in coming years.",
      "Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said.",
      "Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside.",
      "France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company\u2019s annual meeting in April.",
      "Arnault, who attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions.",
      "\u201cIf we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,\u201d Arnault said. \u201cAnd if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.\u201d",
      "'Road could be rocky'",
      "Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail.",
      "Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.",
      "Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday\u2019s deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out.",
      "The most likely outcome of the trade talks is that \u201cthe U.S. will agree to deals in which it takes back its worst threats of \u2018retaliatory\u2019 tariffs well beyond 10%,\u201d Schmieding said. \u201cHowever, the road to get there could be rocky.\u201d",
      "The U.S. offering exemptions for some goods might smooth the path to a deal. The EU could offer to ease some regulations that the White House views as trade barriers.",
      "\u201cWhile Trump might be able to sell such an outcome as a \u2018win\u2019 for him, the ultimate victims of his protectionism would, of course, be mostly the U.S. consumers,\u201d Schmieding said."

      "In fact, the \u201cF1\u201d deal meant that Universal\u2019s \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d didn\u2019t get a domestic IMAX release and was only featured on IMAX screens in China. That film will also appear in IMAX screens in Japan next month.",
      "\u201cF1\u201d has generated $60 million of its total global haul from IMAX theaters, a little more than 20% of its total gross so far. Domestically, the film has generated $27.4 million in ticket sales through IMAX screenings, about 25% of the film\u2019s ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada.",
      "While the film is nearing $300 million in global ticket sales, it still has a few more laps to go in order to be profitable for Apple. The movie cost between $200 million and $300 million to make, according to reports, and an estimated $100 million to market. The studio is also splitting receipts with Warner Bros. and theaters.",
      "\u201cNaturally, a mega budget movie like \u2018F1\u2019 can have a rather long road to profitability given the various revenue splits with movie theaters and Warner Bros. as well, but Apple has the resources to and the cash reserves to take on that risk,\u201d said Dergarabedian.",
      "For Apple, success looks very different than for traditional studios. Entertainment isn\u2019t the company\u2019s main revenue driver \u2014 not even close. Apple has a $3 trillion market cap and generates most of its revenue from its suite of tech devices.",
      "And Apple isn\u2019t just spending money on movies and television products to try and fuel sales of its phones, TVs and computers.",
      "\u201cWe got into this business because we thought it would be a good business,\u201d Apple services chief Eddy Cue said in a recent Bloomberg interview. \u201cAnd in order to continue to do great things, you need businesses to be profitable.\u201d",
      "Apple has gained momentum in the pop culture space with shows like \u201cTed Lasso,\u201d \u201cSeverance\u201d and \u201cThe Studio\u201d and was the first streamer to win the best picture award at the Oscars for 2021\u2032s \u201cCoda.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Growing up near the Guadalupe River in Kerrville, Texas, could sometimes feel like living near a volcano.",
      "I was born two blocks from the gorgeous river that flows from the Hill Country to the Gulf of Mexico, just one year before the devastating and deadly 1987 flash flood, often described around town as the \u201cbig one.\u201d",
      "As a boy, whenever flash floods inevitably struck our area, which could be every few years, my dad would take me down to the overflowing Guadalupe. From a safe distance, we would watch the power of the water and understand the strength and danger behind it. Living near this jewel of the Hill Country was a blessing, but it came with the knowledge that, like a volcano, when it erupted, things could get incredibly bad, incredibly fast.",
      "For Kerrville locals, the power of the Guadalupe was never in doubt. And yet, what happened in the early hours on Friday, when catastrophic flooding struck with a surge topping 20 feet, soon became a perfect storm turned into a once-in-a-lifetime tragedy.",
      "I first heard about the flood on Friday morning, when I woke up in L.A. to a half-dozen text messages from all over the country asking if my family was safe. I later learned that at around 5 a.m., my mother had evacuated her home on the river, where she had retired, while my stepfather helped multiple families and RVs move out of the way before the powerful floods washed them away.",
      "The entire day was a gut-wrenching waiting game because we had friends who were personally affected by the floods, and nobody knew how they were doing. Communication was limited, and it felt like a heartbreaking nightmare playing out over 24 hours.",
      "Having since moved to the West Coast, I rarely report on Texas. However, I knew I had to get to my hometown because there is no place I would rather be than chronicling every step of this tragedy and telling the stories along the way.",
      "As we enter Day 4 of this unimaginable situation, where the death toll has risen to at least 90 across six damaged counties, I am struck by this incredible mix of grief and grit. And while I know that this community will band together to move forward from this, this level of collective pain is something I have never experienced before.",
      "The nature of this job throws you into disasters all over the world, and in each instance, there is a layer of separation. But when it hits your home, it\u2019s like seeing tragedy for the first time.",
      "I\u2019m fortunate to say that my family is safe, but we have friends who this has personally affected, and those in my community are sorting through the unfathomable. As we cover this story, my purpose here is to connect with the people who are trying to make sense of what happened, to share the stories of resilient residents coming together, and to ask questions so this will not happen again.",
      "As a kid growing up in Kerrville, you learn different ways to help your community, such as being in the Boy Scouts or lending a hand when needed. For my grandfather, it was helping rescue kids in 1987 during the last flooding tragedy.",
      "Now, for me as an adult, it\u2019s coming back to Kerrville to stay in my mother\u2019s home to cover this flood that\u2019s become unlike anything we have ever seen before, and hopefully, nothing we ever see again."

      "The trade war chaos that engulfed the early months of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term looked set to return Monday as he threatened two major U.S. trading partners with higher duties \u2014 while a key negotiating deadline was pushed back.",
      "Shortly after noon Monday, Trump published two letters addressed to Japan and South Korea threatening them with 25% duties, with higher ones for items deemed to have been transshipped through their countries.",
      "Transshipping refers to offloading goods from one mode of transportation and reloading onto another. A 25% duty was essentially the level Trump announced for those two countries during his shock \u201cLiberation Day\u201d speech on April 2.",
      "Later Monday afternoon, he posted letters threatening duties of as much as 40% on goods from Laos and Myanmar, along with ones of 30% for goods from South Africa and 25% for ones from Malaysia and Kazakhstan.",
      "Trump would seek to impose the tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. His ability to do so remains in place but is currently under court review.",
      "Markets had already opened the week lower after mixed messaging over the past 72 hours from White House officials about the importance of a July 9 deadline Trump set in April after relenting on imposing the eye-watering country-by-country tariff levels he\u2019d announced one week prior.",
      "After the two letters went live on Truth Social, markets briefly took another leg lower, with the broad S&P 500 stock index falling as much as 1%.",
      "During her regularly scheduled press conference Monday afternoon, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would sign an executive order extending the July 9 deadline to August 1.",
      "It represents a return to the back and forth, on-again, off-again state of affairs that prevailed leading up to, and shortly after, Trump\u2019s April 2 speech announcing extreme import duties on dozens of nations. The moment led to one of the worst market sell-offs on record. During some particularly chaotic moments, Trump changed tariff levels in the span of a few hours.",
      "The president eventually relented on immediately imposing those duties in announcing the pause, and since then, stocks have slowly rallied back to all-time highs.",
      "Heading into this week, the ground already looked set for the July 9 deadline to lose its significance. Asked Friday whether the U.S. would be flexible with any countries about the July 9 deadline, Trump said, \u201cNot really.\u201d",
      "He continued: \u201cThey\u2019ll start to pay on Aug. 1. The money will start to come into the United States on Aug. 1, OK, in pretty much all cases.\u201d",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent attempted to clarify those comments Monday, telling CNBC: \u201cPresident Trump has said \u2026 countries would not go back to the reciprocal rate until Aug. 1.\u201d",
      "While he expects to have \u201cseveral\u201d announcements in the next 48 hours, Bessent said, the president is more focused on the \u201cquality\u201d of deals, not the \u201cquantity\u201d \u2014 though he did not provide details on the nature of the proposed announcements.",
      "So, what comes next?",
      "Perhaps the clearest description of the state of play came from White House spokesman Kush Desai, who told The Wall Street Journal that any decisions around trade would come directly from Trump himself.",
      "In other words, all deals and deadlines will remain in flux as long as the president says so.",
      "To date, the president has announced limited new arrangements with the U.K. and China, as well as a brief statement on a pact with Vietnam. In a social media post Sunday, Trump wrote that \u201cthe UNITED STATES TARIFF Letters, and/or Deals, with various Countries from around the World, will be delivered starting\u201d at noon Washington time Monday.",
      "Trump was already threatening new tariff duties late Sunday, writing in a Truth Social post that an additional 10% tariff, on top of the existing across-the-board 10% baseline, would be imposed on any country aligning themselves with policies set by the BRICS bloc, comprising Brazil, Russia, China and India. The post came as leaders of the bloc met in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "It was not immediately clear what Trump\u2019s rationale is for that assertion.",
      "Some on Wall Street were more optimistic that the return of uncertainty may not weigh as heavily on stocks this time around.",
      "\u201cOur base case remains that the uncertainty around tariffs won\u2019t be enough on its own to bring the US economy to a crashing halt,\u201d analysts with Capital Economics research group and consultancy wrote in a note to clients Monday. \u201cIf so, it\u2019s unlikely to be enough to dampen investors\u2019 enthusiasm for US equities.\u201d",
      "Yet the analysts also acknowledged that renewed chaos could prove a setback for officials at the Federal Reserve, who continue to insist on keeping interest rates high, despite repeated demands from Trump for a rate cut. Rates have remained elevated in anticipation of worsening inflation as a result of the import taxes. It\u2019s something that will continue to make it expensive for the federal government, not to mention consumers and businesses, to borrow money, the analysts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been clear in recent weeks that many [Federal Reserve officials] are not confident about cutting rates until the inflationary effects of tariffs are clearer, and we doubt they\u2019ll cut this year,\u201d they wrote."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cbd-liver-damage-study-potential-problems-rcna217186",
    "published": "Mon, 07 Jul 2025 16:34:38 GMT",
    "summary": "From capsules, gummies and other edibles, to oils and lotions, CBD products have become increasingly popular in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "A new clinical trial suggests there are still ongoing questions about the safety of even low doses of cannabidiol, even as CBD capsules, gummies, edibles, oils and lotions have become increasingly omnipresent in the United States in recent years.",
      "Scientists from the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s Division of Applied Regulatory Science carried out a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial last year to assess how low-dose CBD affects liver function in a group of healthy middle-aged men and women.",
      "Over the course of four weeks, 201 volunteers received either 5 mg per kilogram of body weight (approximately 2.3 mg per pound or the equivalent of 350 mg for a 154-pound individual) of oral CBD, or a placebo. The goal was to give them a typical amount that might be used by consumers. Participants also underwent weekly laboratory assessments.",
      "While the vast majority of people in the trial were unaffected, 5% showed greatly elevated levels of the liver enzyme aminotransferase, a known marker of liver cell damage or inflammation, according to the study published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine. Women appeared to be more vulnerable than men. The liver enzyme returned to normal within one or two weeks of stopping CBD.",
      "Seven participants withdrew from the trial because they were showing clinical signs of potential drug-induced liver injury.",
      "The FDA didn\u2019t respond immediately to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant finding, as it suggests that CBD itself, even in the absence of other drugs, may pose a risk to liver health,\u201d says Amir Englund, a researcher at King\u2019s College London who studies cannabinoid psychopharmacology, and was not involved in the new trial. \u201cThe results have important implications for individuals using over-the-counter CBD supplements. Many may be unaware of the potential for liver injury and assume that CBD is entirely benign.\u201d",
      "Between 2014 and 2022, CBD product sales in the U.S. increased from $108 million to $1.9 billion, after a landmark bill passed by the Trump administration in 2018 enabled the unrestricted sale of cannabis products containing less than 0.3% THC, the psychoactive element which gets users high.",
      "According to various surveys in recent years, the majority of people in the U.S. have now heard of CBD, and around 20% have reported using CBD products in the past 12 months.",
      "While CBD products  have become a popular way to self-medicate for conditions including pain, anxiety, insomnia and depression, especially among older adults, there\u2019s been little evidence on how well they work or guidance on how to use the products safely.",
      "Symptoms of liver injury",
      "Signs of liver injury include abdominal discomfort, jaundice or yellowing of the skin and eyes, and fatigue.",
      "However, research has shown that drug-induced liver injuries don't always become immediately apparent. In the FDA trial, only one of the participants with elevated liver enzymes noticed any symptoms within four weeks. The authors suggested that users may not realize that they are incurring harm and that doctors should ask about regular CBD use as part of routine medical screening.",
      "\u201cThis was an important observation from the study,\u201d said Paul Watkins, professor of pharmacy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cWhen doctors get liver chemistry results back and they\u2019re out of whack, they should be aware to ask, \u2018Were you taking CBD?\u2019 Because a lot of people are.\u201d",
      "The new trial is not the first study to suggest potential health risks relating to cannabidiol and its effects on the liver. Such concerns were initially described following an FDA review of clinical trial data on CBD-based prescription drugs for childhood epilepsy, with raised liver enzymes being observed in 14% of participants.",
      "\u201cIn clinical trials involving epilepsy patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes were among the leading causes of withdrawal from the trials due to serious adverse events,\u201d  Englund said \u201cHowever, those participants were concurrently taking other anti-epileptic medications, which could have contributed to the observed liver effects.\u201d",
      "Watkins was subsequently involved in research investigating why CBD can affect liver cells, and he said that certain doses seem to have an effect similar to acetaminophen, or paracetamol.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s also been shown that healthy adults, when they get recurrent therapeutic doses of paracetamol, also have these liver chemistry abnormalities,\u201d Watkins said.",
      "In the U.S., acetaminophen, when taken in excess, is among the most common causes of drug-induced liver injury, also called toxic hepatitis.",
      "In the last few years, research studies have shown that people most at risk of liver injury are those taking very high oral doses of CBD, exceeding 1000 mg per day. There have still been reports of drug-induced liver injuries in some healthy individuals taking moderate doses of anywhere between 300 mg and 1000 mg per day.",
      "Relatively little is known about why some people are more susceptible than others, but it is thought that genetic factors may play a role. According to Englund, CBD can inhibit certain enzymes in the liver which are needed for metabolizing medications.",
      "In the new FDA trial, the majority of participants who experienced the most serious liver problems also developed signs of an immune condition called eosinophilia, which is when the body produces an excess of a type of white blood cell called eosinophils.",
      "The new results emphasize the importance of tracking liver safety as a potential, unintended adverse effect, Englund said.",
      "\u201cGiven the growing interest in CBD as a potential treatment for conditions such as psychosis and cannabis use disorder, these findings underscore the importance of monitoring liver enzyme levels in future clinical trials,\u201d he said.",
      "Overall, Watkins \u2014 who co-chairs the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network, a research group backed by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health \u2014 still believes CBD is relatively safe.",
      "While over-the-counter supplements are becoming a growing potential cause of significant liver injuries, CBD has yet to be flagged as a source of concern, he said.",
      "\u201cOverall, the liver is very good at adjusting to sources of drug stress [indicated by elevated enzymes],\u201d Watkins said, noting the network hasn't detected a case of serious liver injury attributed to CBD. \"There could be people out there whose liver doesn\u2019t adjust very well, and as companies compete for market share, you might start getting more potent CBD which could push people into the ranges where they\u2019re getting into trouble, but the data we\u2019ve got suggests it\u2019s very safe.\u201d"

      "What\u2019s different at the new resort?",
      "According to Azura Beach Resort\u2019s website, the all-inclusive, adults-only hotel is located on Playa S\u00e1mara, a bay in the Pacific Ocean. Playa S\u00e1mara is about five hours from Costa Rica's main airport in San Jos\u00e9.",
      "The Costa Rican location offers amenities the Mexican resort didn\u2019t have \u2014 starting with air conditioning. Previously, \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d stars stayed in open air bungalows without AC.",
      "Entertainment Weekly\u2019s preview of the room setup shows the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d cast stayed in rooms that open out to a private pool.",
      "Speaking to Entertainment Weekly, showrunner Scott Teti went into detail about what the hotel offered \u2014\u00a0beyond the \"sexy chicness\" he said it has.",
      "\u201cThe cast can literally open the doors to their rooms and swim out into the pool under bridges, and then up to a beautiful bar that is touching the beach. It has amazing views. The beach itself is private and unique. There\u2019s a beautiful island right off it with a bunch of fishing boats that surround it every day, with a quaint little town right next door, but not a ton of foot traffic. It feels remote and upscale and sexy at the same time,\u201d Teti said.",
      "Did the cast share rooms?",
      "According to Teti, each cast member bunked with a roommate while filming. There was, however, a VIP Room where the cast could get a little privacy \u2014\u00a0the Boom Boom Room by a different name.",
      "\"Bachelor in Paradise\" starts on Monday, July 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT."

      "\"Welcome back to 'Love Island USA,'\" Stirling said after the first commercial break. \"Cierra has left the villa due to a personal situation, leaving Nic officially single.\"",
      "Ortega's removal came after viewers surfaced old social media posts of hers that contained racial slurs. The 25-year-old influencer lost over 100,000 Instagram followers overnight once posts surfaced online.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Peacock for comment. Peacock is owned by NBCUniversal, TODAY\u2019s parent company.",
      "Ortega has not publicly addressed her departure, but her parents issued a statement on her Instagram story addressing the matter.",
      "\"As Cierra's parents, this has been one of the most painful weeks of our lives,\" the post began.",
      "\"We're not here to justify or ignore what's surfaced. We understand people are upset, and we know accountability matters. But what's happening online right now has gone far beyond that.\"",

      "\"As a proud Asian American woman, I'm deeply appreciative of the Love Island USA producers for taking a stand and making it clear that racism of any kind is not tolerated,\" she said.",
      "Walker used the moment to highlight anti-Asian hate, writing, \"Asian hate is oftentimes overlooked and dismissed. But being a first-generation American, I have personally witnessed and experienced how real and hurtful comments like these are,\" she said.",
      "The post concluded with Walker asking her followers to \"think twice before leaving unkind comments\" on anyone's accounts, maintaining that she doesn't \"condone bigotry or racism of any kind.\"",
      "Following Ortega's departure, the boys tried to comfort Vansteenberghe.",
      "\"Right before Cierra had left, my mind was clear,\" Vansteenberghe said in his confessional. \"I knew what the future would look like, and now I'm lost.\"",

      "In a race between Joey Chestnut and Usain Bolt, who could eat a hot dog then run a 100-meter dash faster?",
      "Professional athletes and hot dog-eating contest fans alike are divided as the new hypothetical scenario goes viral on social media.",
      "In a TikTok video posted by the official account for the PGA Tour, professional golfers were asked whether the nationally recognized competitive eater would beat the eight-time Olympic gold medalist sprinter in the proposed race.",
      "Without hesitation, Max Homa responded to the hypothetical, \u201cOh, Joey Chestnut, I think.\u201d",
      "Later in the clip, he explained that he believes Chestnut could likely run 100 meters in less than 20 seconds, adding, \u201cI\u2019m hard pressed that I could eat a hot dog in 20 seconds. Yeah, I\u2019m going Joey Chestnut.\u201d",
      "At first, Jordan Spieth locked in Bolt before asking how quickly Chestnut can eat a hot dog. (In this year's Fourth of July hot dog eating contest, Chestnut was once again crowned winner, consuming 70.5 hot dogs and buns in 10 minutes.)",
      "After questioning some of the logistics of the race \u2014 like whether the hot dog would be consumed at the starting line, which could lead to a head start for Chestnut, Spieth decided on the sprinter.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going with who can run faster because I think a hot dog can get wolfed down pretty quick,\u201d he said, before posing an alternative. \u201cNow, if you said, \u201810 hot dogs and then run,\u2019 when does it even out?\u201d",
      "\u201cJoey Chestnut would smoke him at 10 (hot dogs before running),\u201d Spieth added. \u201cI think even two might be close.\u201d",
      "Saheeth Theegala reasoned that \u201ceven if Joey runs a 15-second 100-meter,\u201d the golfer still felt Chestnut would win.",
      "\u201cI think Usain, even if he eats (the hot dog) as fast as he could and swallows it, I don\u2019t see him eating it in under 8, 10 seconds,\u201d he said, adding his final consensus is that Bolt finishing an entire hot dog will take longer than Chestnut\u2019s ability to run 100 meters.",
      "Amid much internal debate and in-depth analysis, the pro golfers landed fairly divided over who would win the competition \u2014 ever so slightly favoring Chestnut. And the comment section under the TikTok video equally entertained the proposition.",
      "\u201cJoey is taking this without a doubt,\u201d one user wrote.",
      "\u201cDo you people have any idea the amount of calories that Usain Bolt has to eat to maintain his performance level? He could put down a single hot (dog) pretty ... quick I imagine,\u201d another argued.",
      "While some found it wild to compare the Olympic medalist widely regarded as \u201cthe fastest man in history\u201d to the 17-time champion of Nathan\u2019s July Fourth competitive eating contest, some still theorized Chestnut would take home the gold this time around.",
      "Other comments simply marveled at the \u201cphenomenal question\u201d itself, with one user writing, \u201cthat\u2019s the greatest hypothetical ever.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhoever came up with this question deserves a raise,\u201d another wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the \"Love Island USA\" villa, where drama runs deeper than the pool that few people are seen swimming in and your vote holds more power than a perfectly timed text message.",
      "While the Islanders navigate dramatic re-couplings and spicy challenges, you \u2014 the devoted viewer at home \u2014 get to play puppet master in this sun-soaked theater of romance.",
      "From deciding which couples deserve a second chance to sending your least favorite Islander packing their suitcase, your vote can shift the entire trajectory of the villa.",
      "The \"Love Island USA\" voting system puts viewers in the driver's seat of the villa's most pivotal moments.",
      "Whether you\u2019re pro chaos or rooting for genuine connections, your participation can directly shape which Islanders get to stay in paradise and which ones are catching the next flight home.",
      "The power dynamics shift constantly in the villa, but one thing remains consistent: The audience holds the ultimate authority over who wins that $100,000 prize.",

      "Your Vote Matters",
      "In a villa where a single conversation can change everything, never underestimate the impact of your participation. Islanders have been saved by narrow margins, and fan favorites have been unexpectedly eliminated.",
      "So download that app, set those notifications, and get ready to help write the next chapter of \u201cLove Island USA\u201c Season 7. After all, the best love stories are the ones we all help create together \u2014even if that means occasionally stirring the pot for the sake of good television.",

She explained that she bit off part of her tooth while eating dinner the night before and she wanted to see if could smooth the chipped enamel and make it look \u201cmore nonchalant.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m scared for this,\u201d she said as she started to use the nail file. But afterwards, she was satisfied with her appearance and smiled at the camera.",

      "\u201cWell, I guess, veneer reveal. It was after I graduated college, I think, like in August, I did it. I never wanted to post about it because I immediately feel like I regretted it, and I never want to influence people to do something that I don\u2019t think they should do,\u201d she shared.",

Again, she was pleased with the results, but they didn\u2019t last because didn\u2019t wear her retainers, causing her teeth to shift. So, prior to graduation she underwent a cosmetic procedure called composite bonding. The reversible cosmetic procedure involves applying \u201ctooth-colored resin material to the affected teeth to change their shape, size or color,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "When the material cracked due to her biting her teeth, she finally opted to get veneers.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an anxious person. So sometimes, if I have, like, a bad dream, I\u2019ll bite my teeth and they would crack off. It happened a lot, honestly, probably like twice a year they cracked off. Senior year of college (I) started getting a following on here, made some money,\u201d she explained. \u201cBecause I had friends that had veneers on just these two (front) teeth, I was like, \u2018Oh, you know what? That seems like a good idea.\u2019\u201d",
      "She spoke to a dentist who claimed it wouldn\u2019t be possible to only fix two of her teeth. According to her, the dentist said it would not be worth it to get the cosmetic procedure because all her teeth would not look the same.",
      "\u201cSo I went in for two teeth, and I basically left with 10,\u201d she continued as she became emotional. \u201cIt was one of those things that I did it and\u2026I regretted it right away. I think it was really scary for me I was like, \u2018What did I just do?\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cI will say I don\u2019t regret a lot. It is something I really regret doing. At the end of the day, whatever, it was my decision. But I feel like it was kind of one of those decisions that was made pretty fast and I just didn\u2019t think it all the way through, or, I think, talk to enough people.\u201d",
      "Despite some moments of insecurity since then, she has grown to like her smile.",
      "\u201cI actually like the character in my teeth. It\u2019s great,\u201d she said.",
      "Toward the end of the video, she apologized to any fans who might be upset that she didn\u2019t share this information sooner.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re thinking about doing anything to your teeth, this is your sign to not do it and to embrace your natural teeth,\u201d she concluded. \u201cDon\u2019t follow my lead on this one.\u201d"

      "The Dalai Lama said Wednesday that the ancient Tibetan Buddhist institution he leads will live on after he dies, putting an end to speculation that he would be the last person to hold the role as he plans to reincarnate.",
      "As part of celebrations marking his 90th birthday, the Dalai Lama, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, also signaled that China, which Tibetan activists accuse of suppressing their language, culture and religion, should stay out of the process of choosing his successor.",
      "\u201cI am affirming that the institution of the Dalai Lama will continue,\u201d said the Dalai Lama, who has spent almost 70 years living in exile in India after he fled Tibet, an autonomous Himalayan region of China.",
      "\u201cI hereby reiterate that the Gaden Phodrang Trust has sole authority to recognize the future reincarnation,\u201d he said, referring to an organization he founded. \u201cNo one else has any such authority to interfere in this matter.\u201d",
      "Anxiety is mounting over who will follow him as the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism, in which he is worshiped as a living manifestation of Chenrezig, the Buddhist god of compassion. His succession plan is likely to have an impact on Tibetans opposed to China\u2019s tight control of the Himalayan autonomous region.",
      "The Chinese government responded to the comments swiftly, with a spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Ministry saying the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval from the central government, spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",
      "The Dalai Lama made the announcement days ahead of his 90th birthday on Sunday, after a conference of representatives of the four major traditions of Titbetan Buddhism in the Indian city of Dharamsala, the seat of the Tibetan government-in-exile.",
      "It\u2019s unusual for a living Dalai Lama to talk about his successor, the search for whom begins only upon his death because it involves reincarnation. But as the 14th Dalai Lama grows older, there is growing worry that the Chinese government could take advantage of a gap in leadership.",
      "\u201cI think His Holiness feels the need to reassure people by basically letting them know that he is thinking about the succession,\u201d Thupten Jinpa, his English translator of four decades, said in a phone interview from India last week.",
      "Identified as a baby in 1937, the 14th Dalai Lama was formally recognized two years later. In addition to his role as spiritual leader, he was temporal leader of Tibet starting in 1950, when he was 15 and China began annexing the region.",
      "In 1959, when he was 23, the Dalai Lama and thousands of other Tibetans fled to India after a failed uprising against Communist rule, eventually settling in Dharamsala.",
      "Since the 1970s, the goal of the movement has shifted from Tibetan independence to achieving genuine autonomy within China. In recent years, the Dalai Lama has also stepped down from his political role, which is now a democratically elected position.",
      "In March, he said in a new book that his successor would be born in the \u201cfree world\u201d outside China so that the traditional mission of the Dalai Lama could continue. According to the Central Tibetan Administration, there are about 130,000 Tibetan exiles around the world, mostly in India and Nepal.",
      "The Dalai Lama had said in 2011 that the institution of the Dalai Lama did not necessarily have to continue at all and that he would leave it up to the Tibetan Buddhist community.",
      "Since then, he has received appeals from a variety of constituencies, and the \u201cunanimous\u201d response, Jinpa said, has been that there should be a 15th Dalai Lama.",
      "\u201cFor the Tibetan people, his name has come to symbolize the nation,\u201d said Jinpa, who has assisted the Dalai Lama with a number of books, including the recent \u201cVoice for the Voiceless.\u201d",
      "There is also concern that if they do not select a new Dalai Lama, China could name one who goes unchallenged.",
      "\u201cSadly, the PRC government probably will want to play a role, just as it inserted itself in the process of the recognition of the Panchen Lama,\u201d Jinpa said, referring to the second-highest spiritual leader in Tibetan Buddhism.",
      "In 1995, the Dalai Lama recognized a 6-year-old boy in Tibet as the 11th Panchen Lama, six years after the previous one died. The boy was forcibly \u201cdisappeared\u201d by the Chinese government three days later, rights groups say, and has not been seen in public since.",
      "China then chose its own Panchen Lama, imposing him on the 6 million people in Tibet.",
      "The Tibetan government-in-exile does not recognize the Beijing-appointed Panchen Lama, who rarely appears in public but pledged loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party in a closed-door meeting last month with President Xi Jinping, state media reported.",
      "If Beijing also tries to name a Dalai Lama, \u201cTibetans would not be surprised,\u201d Jinpa said. \u201cThey would be disappointed and annoyed, but I don\u2019t think they would be surprised.\u201d",
      "The Chinese government says that Tibet has prospered under its rule and that it has improved infrastructure and social conditions and promoted economic development. It says that the Dalai Lama is \u201ca political exile engaged in separatist activities under the guise of religion\u201d and that the reincarnation of Tibetan lamas should be controlled by Beijing.",
      "China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said the Dalai Lama must be reincarnated \u201cin accordance with Chinese laws and regulations\u201d that Beijing claims aim to protect the tradition and religious freedom.",
      "The succession must take place in mainland China and get approval by the central government, Mao, the ministry spokesperson, said Wednesday."

    "story": [
      "LIUYANG, China \u2014 There are few sights more dazzling than fireworks on the Fourth of July. Yet all the sparkle and sound on the most American day of the year relies almost solely on China, which is mired in a trade war with the United States that could disrupt fireworks displays across the country from big cities to backyard barbecues.",
      "The U.S. imported more than 120,000 tons of fireworks in 2023, with over 97% of them \u2014 including those displayed at Independence Day celebrations \u2014 coming from China, according to the World Bank. American fireworks wholesalers and distributors are warning that President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports could limit supply and send prices soaring unless the duties are brought down.",
      "Though most Chinese-made fireworks were shipped in time for this year\u2019s Fourth of July celebrations, uncertainty hangs over future holidays as well as the \u201cgrand celebration\u201d Trump has promised for the 250th anniversary of American independence next year.",
      "U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports, which had reached as high as 145%, are currently at 30% after the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day trade truce that ends in mid-August. The tariff rate for fireworks was previously 5%.",
      "The uncertainty is felt strongly here in Liuyang, a production hub in the southern Chinese province of Hunan that on its own makes nearly 60% of the world\u2019s fireworks. The city of about 1.5 million people is proudly known as the birthplace of fireworks, with a history in the business dating to China\u2019s Tang Dynasty more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Wendy Tang, owner of Pyroshine Fireworks in Liuyang, said factories went through a \u201creally hard time\u201d when U.S.-China trade tensions escalated in March and April, a peak shipping season for July Fourth fireworks. At times, the U.S. and China were increasing their tariff rates multiple times a day.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, it\u2019s 100%. But in the afternoon, it\u2019s like 200%,\u201d Tang said, making it \u201cvery hard\u201d for her American customers to decide whether to proceed with their orders.",
      "Her U.S. clients eventually chose to go ahead, Tang said, and her company cleared almost all of its stock.",
      "\u201cMy customers said: \u2018OK. No matter what, we need fireworks for the consumers during the Independence Day,\u2019\u201d said Tang, who said she is now trying to confirm as many orders as possible for next year\u2019s July Fourth.",
      "While most U.S. warehouses were already stocked with fireworks for this year, shows in some places may be scaled back or cost more.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at $20,000 or more increased cost just to get the container out of port,\u201d Matthew Lavigne, the owner of Green Mountain Fireworks in Alburgh, Vermont, told NBC affiliate WPTZ.",
      "In a letter to Trump sent in April, the American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association said the tariffs could \u201ccripple\u201d the $2 billion fireworks industry in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs will not incentivize U.S. production \u2014 they will only increase costs,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Though fireworks received a tariff exemption during Trump\u2019s first term, there is no word on whether there will be any such reprieve this time around.",
      "In a statement, White House spokesperson Kush Desai said: \u201cReal prosperity and patriotism isn\u2019t celebrating the independence of our country with cheap foreign-made firecrackers and trinkets \u2014 it\u2019s having a country with booming Main Streets, a thriving working class, and robust manufacturing.\u201d",
      "The fireworks industry says it would be impossible for the U.S. to replicate Chinese manufacturing, citing its lack of key raw materials, its high labor costs and the extensive land it requires.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no country on the planet that can have this infrastructure and can do mass production that they can do here,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Souza Linares, international business manager at the Indiana-based North Central Industries, the largest supplier of fireworks in the U.S. Midwest, said in an interview in Liuyang.",
      "At Tang\u2019s factory, there are dozens of workshops scattered across the slopes, serving different purposes in the production process.",
      "Some steps are automated, such as cutting paper and rolling it into shells or stacking tubes to form casings, but others, such as loading powder into the tubes, have to be done by hand because the work is so delicate and risky.",
      "An explosion at a Hunan fireworks factory this month killed nine people and injured 26 others, according to Xinhua, China\u2019s state-run news agency.",
      "To prevent such accidents, work areas are separated by walls and kept at a distance from each other, with high-risk stages monitored by surveillance cameras overseen by local authorities. The government has strict rules limiting the amount of explosive powder each person can handle and the number of workers allowed in each area at any given time.",
      "Workers wear color-coded uniforms from yellow to orange \u2014 orange being the most dangerous \u2014 to indicate the level of danger linked with their tasks. Those working with the most dangerous materials are required to stop by around noon, before the hottest time of day.",
      "The American fireworks industry, which is made up mostly of small businesses, relies heavily on factories such as Tang\u2019s to supply events big and small.",
      "But Pyroshine Fireworks has received \u201cvery few orders\u201d recently as U.S. distributors \u201cwait and see what\u2019s going to happen with the tariffs,\u201d said Melissa Cai, the company\u2019s U.S. sales manager.",

      "\u201cDrug addiction led me to a critical condition. I couldn\u2019t find a way out, and I was scared,\u201d he told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "A year ago, he managed to escape from a panic house (also known as panicueva, or panic cave) commonly used by organized crime gangs in Mexico. Some of these buildings, located in Guanajuato and other states where drug use is rampant, also serve as recruitment bases for young people selected to become hit men and operatives for these criminal groups.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the place where you can go, buy your drugs, and get high right there,\u201d said another 19-year-old who managed to escape a panic house and was interviewed by Noticias Telemundo on the condition that he remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.",
      "\"I entered a panic house and saw several women who had to prostitute themselves, and several of my friends got involved in selling drugs and ended up being killed,\u201d said the young man. He said he spent five years living in one of the houses and eventually joined a local gang.",
      "According to the latest report issued by the Mexican government, Guanajuato is the state with the highest number of homicides (980 from January to April). In February, the daily average reached 12.5. Last year, the Victimization and Security Perception Survey revealed that 87.5% of the population in Guanajuato considered public safety to be the most serious problem in the state.",

      "\"Drug houses\" aren\u2019t unique to Mexico; similar trends exist in other countries, such as drug houses in the United States or drug dens in Spain. \u201cWhile criminals may be attracted to abandoned houses, these are also spaces where potential victims and criminals tend to converge without surveillance. Our results support the idea that abandoned houses also generate crime,\u201d said Lauren C. Porter, a professor at the University of Maryland who co-wrote a study on the issue.",

      "Since taking office in January, Trump has signed executive orders to curb transgender rights and dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion practices in the government and private sector.",
      "His administration says such steps restore fairness, but civil rights and LGBTQ advocates say they make marginalized groups more vulnerable.",
      "In negotiations before the vote, Pakistan voiced opposition to the mandate on behalf of Muslim group OIC, calling it a tool to advocate \u201ccontroversial views.\""

      "The volcano monitoring agency had increased the alert status for Mount Lewotobi Laki Laki to the highest level after an eruption on June 18, and more than doubled an exclusion zone to a 7-kilometer (4.3-mile) radius since then as eruptions became more frequent.",

      "Khamenei\u2019s absence during the war suggested the Iranian leader, who has final say on all state matters, had been in seclusion in a bunker \u2014 something not acknowledged by state media. State TV in Iran showed him waving and nodding to the chanting crowd, which rose to its feet as he entered and sat at a mosque next to his office and residence in the capital, Tehran.",
      "There was no immediate report on any public statement made. Iranian officials such as the parliament speaker were present. Such events are always held under heavy security.",
      "After the U.S. inserted itself into the war by bombing three key nuclear sites in Iran, U.S. President Donald Trump sent warnings via social media to the 86-year-old Khamenei that the U.S. knew where he was but had no plans to kill him, \u201cat least for now.\u201d",

      "Iran\u2019s president on Wednesday ordered the country to suspend its cooperation with the watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, further limiting inspectors\u2019 ability to track a program that had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels. Israel launched the war fearing that Iran was trying to develop atomic weapons.",
      "It remains unclear just how badly damaged the nuclear facilities are, whether any enriched uranium or centrifuges had been moved before the attacks, and whether Tehran still would be willing to continue negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program.",
      "Israel also targeted defense systems, high-ranking military officials and atomic scientists. In retaliation, Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of them intercepted, killing 28 people and causing damage in many areas.",
      "Ceremony commemorates a death that caused rift in Islam",
      "The ceremony that Khamenei hosted Saturday was a remembrance of the 7th century martyrdom of the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s grandson, Hussein.",
      "Shiites represent over 10% of the world\u2019s 1.8 billion Muslims, and they view Hussein as the rightful successor to the Prophet Muhammad. Hussein\u2019s death in battle at the hands of Sunnis at Karbala, south of Baghdad, created a rift in Islam and continues to play a key role in shaping Shiite identity.",
      "In predominantly Shiite Iran, red flags represented Hussein\u2019s blood and black funeral tents and clothes represented mourning. Processions of chest-beating and self-flagellating men demonstrated fervor. Some sprayed water over the mourners in the intense heat.",
      "Reports of problems accessing the internet",
      "NetBlocks, a global internet monitor, reported late Saturday on X that there was a \u201cmajor disruption to internet connectivity\u201d in Iran. It said the disruption corroborated widespread user reports of problems accessing the internet. The development comes just weeks after authorities shut down telecoms during the war. NetBlocks later said internet access had been restored after some two hours."
