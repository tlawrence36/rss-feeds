      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "He was covering the second Gulf War for NBC and National Geographic in 2003 when he was fired for granting an interview to Iraqi state TV during which he criticized the U.S. military\u2019s war strategy. His remarks were denounced back home as anti-American.",
      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",
      "In 2007, he took a job teaching journalism at China\u2019s Shantou University. Following his retirement in 2014, he and his wife, Nina Nguyen, moved to the Southern California suburb of Fountain Valley.",
      "Born Nov. 13, 1934, in Riverton, New Zealand, Peter Arnett got his first exposure to journalism when he landed a job at his local newspaper, the Southland Times, shortly after high school.",
      "\"I didn't really have a clear idea of where my life would take me, but I do remember that first day when I walked into the newspaper office as an employee and found my little desk, and I did have a \u2014 you know \u2014 enormously delicious feeling that I'd found my place,\" he recalled in a 2006 AP oral history.",
      "After a few years at the Times, he made plans to move to a larger newspaper in London. En route to England by ship, however, he made a stop in Thailand and fell in love with the country.",
      "Soon he was working for the English-language Bangkok World, and later for its sister newspaper in Laos. There he would make the connections that led him to the AP and a lifetime of covering war.",
      "Arnett is survived by his wife and their children, Elsa and Andrew.",
      "\"He was like a brother,\" said retired AP photographer Nick Ut, who covered combat in Vietnam with Arnett and remained his friend for a half century. \"His death will leave a big hole in my life.\u201d",

      "Arab female film directors are reshaping Arab cinema by telling untold stories and claiming space in a traditionally male-dominated industry",
      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Arab female film directors have helped change the landscape of Arab cinema in recent years, presenting stories that haven't been told before and claiming space in an industry in a region that rarely makes room for women to grow.",
      "Four influential female directors took part in this year's Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah, paving the way for more diverse narratives in Arab cinema.",
      "The festival, bringing together 38 directors, showcases Saudi Arabia's heavy investment in film, gaming and sports as part of its broader transformation efforts. Some rights groups have criticized these actions, saying they serve to draw away attention from the kingdom\u2019s human rights record, including its high rate of executions and restrictions on free expression.",
      "Palestinian American filmmaker Cherien Dabis premiered her new film \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You,\u201d a multigenerational story tracing one family\u2019s experience from the 1948 Nakba, Arabic for catastrophe, the mass expulsion of Palestinians before and during the Arab-Israeli war that followed Israel\u2019s establishment, to 2022. The film deals with themes of Palestinian displacement and personal loss.",
      "\u201cIt tells the story of one family over three generations and how they survive the Nakba in 1948 and the ongoing occupation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives people context for how we got to where we are today and shows how much Palestinians have had to endure throughout the decades.\u201d",
      "Dabis, born and raised in the United States to Palestinian-Jordanian parents, said her passion and inspiration to become a filmmaker grew from a lack of authentic Arab and Palestinian representation in Western media. \u201cI became aware that I wanted to go into storytelling in order to tell our authentic stories, because I couldn\u2019t find us anywhere,\u201d she said.",
      "She said growing up in the U.S. offered better opportunities for a career in cinema than the Arab world, but the racism her family faced reinforced her desire to challenge harmful stereotypes. \u201cMy experience in the diaspora is really what compelled me to become a storyteller,\u201d she said.",
      "And she still struggled to be taken seriously, feeling pressure to adopt a more authoritative, even masculine tone to counter assumptions about women directors. \"There is this image of women filmmakers as overly emotional or unable to command a set,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of us felt we had to overcome these unfair ideas.\u201d",
      "Her film \u201cAll That\u2019s Left of You\u201d won the Silver Yusr Feature Film award, which comes with a $30,000 prize, at the Red Sea Film Festival.",
      "Saudi filmmaker Shahad Ameen emerged as one of the standout voices at this year\u2019s festival. Her latest film, \u201cHijra,\" won the Yusr Jury Prize, marking another milestone in her career.",
      "\u201cHijra\u201d tells the story of three women \u2014 a grandmother and her two granddaughters \u2014 on a journey from Taif to Mecca to perform Hajj, the Islamic pilgrimage. When one of the granddaughters suddenly disappears in the desert, the film follows the search for her across southern Saudi Arabia.",
      "Ameen traces her passion for filmmaking back to her childhood, inspired by the historical television dramas that once dominated Arab screens. \u201cI felt that as Arabs, we need to make our voices heard by ourselves, not have someone else speak on our behalf,\" she said.",

      "She said filmmaking remains an uncertain path for Arab women, demanding constant perseverance with no guarantees of success. \u201cEvery film is a new beginning,\u201d she said, noting that directors must repeatedly convince investors, festivals and audiences of their vision.",
      "Amira Diab's journey into filmmaking wasn\u2019t traditional. A former financial investment professional based in Manhattan, she found her calling after watching \u201cOmar,\" the Oscar-nominated film by Palestinian director Hany Abu-Assad \u2014 who would later become her husband. The film, and their connection, pulled her into the world of cinema.",
      "Diab went on to study film production in Los Angeles, working with Abu-Assad as a producer. She directed two short films and collaborated with her husband on a series. One of her breakout moments came with the short film \u201cAs a Husband,\" part of the Netflix anthology \u201cLove, Life, and What\u2019s Between.\"",
      "The film resonated deeply with audiences for capturing the emotional duality of life in the Palestinian territories. \u201cPeople told me they saw so much of themselves in it. It\u2019s how life is in Palestine \u2014 joy turns into mourning, then back into joy. But there\u2019s always a glimmer of hope,\u201d she said.",
      "Diab\u2019s feature film \u201cWedding Rehearsal\u201d began as a story rooted in the Palestinian territories but evolved to take place in Egypt \u2014 a decision she felt expanded the story\u2019s cultural reach. \u201cEgypt has such a rich, diverse social fabric,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I worked with amazing people like Nelly Karim and Sherif Salama. Egypt really embraced me.\u201d",
      "Even though she has experience in Hollywood, Diab remains committed to telling Arab stories centered on women\u2019s voices. \u201cOf course women see the world differently. That\u2019s why our voices matter,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t mean men can\u2019t write about women \u2014 it just means that certain emotional details only women can fully bring to the screen.\u201d",
      "Zain Duraie said her love with filmmaking began as a 10-year-old watching \u201cTitanic\u201d with her father in Amman, Jordan. She found herself captivated not by the love story, but by how the ship sank \u2014 how the film was made. That spark turned into a passion nurtured by school theater and later refined at the Toronto Film School.",
      "At the Red Sea International Film Festival, Zain premiered her first feature film, \u201cSink,\u201d about a mother struggling with her mentally ill son, a subject often overlooked in Arab cinema.",
      "Duraie started her career at the bottom, taking on every role she could from production assistant, assistant director, producer, before directing her own films. \u201cI carried heavy equipment up mountains,\u201d she recalled. \u201cPeople told me, \u2018This isn\u2019t a woman\u2019s job,\u2019\u201d but that only pushed her further. \u201cI worked in everything in filmmaking. I wanted to learn it all.\u201d",
      "Duraie is known for tackling deeply personal and social issues, especially around mental health and the female experience. \u201cI love to work in the psychology of drama, and I want to tell stories about women \u2014 but break stereotypes too,\u201d she said. She said Arab cinema is not there yet when it comes to gender inclusion.",

      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d will probably be a rewarding experience for fans of James Cameron's saga",
      "When I came down with a cold the day after I saw the third and latest \u201cAvatar\u201d film, \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d I half-wondered if I had picked it up on Pandora.",
      "The promise of Cameron\u2019s 3D trilogy has always been immersion: immersion in a science-fiction world, in technological wonder, in a maybe future of movies. \u201cAvatar\u201d is almost more a place to go than a movie to see.",
      "Still, it\u2019s now been two decades since Cameron set off on this blue-tinted quest. The sheen of newness is off, or at least less pronounced, with new technological advances to contend with. \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is running with a behind-the-scenes video about how performance capture was used during the film\u2019s making. The implicit message is: No, this isn\u2019t AI.",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films, with their visual-effects wizardry and clunky revisionist Western storytelling, have always felt, most of all, like an immersion in a dream of James Cameron\u2019s. The idea of these movies, after all, first came to Cameron, he has said, in a bioluminescent vision decades ago. At their best, the \u201cAvatar\u201d movies have felt like an otherworldly stage for Cameron to juggle so many of the things \u2014 hulking weaponry, ecological wonder, foolhardy human arrogance \u2014 that have marked his movies.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d at well more than three hours, is our longest stay yet on Pandora and the one most likely to make you ponder why you came here, in the first place. These remain epics of craft and conviction. You can feel Cameron\u2019s deep devotion to the dynamics of his central characters, even when his interest outstrips our own.",
      "That\u2019s especially true in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d which, following the deep-sea, family-focused part two, \u201cThe Way of Water,\u201d pivots to a new chapter of culture clash. It introduces a violent rival Na\u2019vi clan whose rageful leader, Varang (Oona Chaplin), partners with Stephen Lang\u2019s booming Col. Miles Quaritch and the human colonizers.",
      "For those who have closely followed the \u201cAvatar\u201d saga, I suspect \u201cFire and Ash\u201d will be a rewarding experience. Quaritch, Pandora\u2019s answer to Robert Duvall\u2019s Bill Kilgore in \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d remains a ferociously captivating character. And the introduction of Chaplin\u2019s Varang gives this installment an electricity that the previous two were missing.",
      "But for those whose trips to Pandora have made less of an impact, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d is a bit like returning to a half-remembered vacation spot, only one where the local ponytail style is a little strange and everyone seems to have the waist of a supermodel.",
      "Time has only reinforced the sense that these films are hermetically sealed movie terrariums. They're like a $1 billion beta test that, for all their box-office success, have ultimately proven that all the design capabilities in the world can\u2019t conjure a story of meaningful impact. The often-remarked light cultural footprint left by the first two blockbusters only hints at why these movie seem to evaporate by the ending credits. It\u2019s the lack of inner life to any of the characters and the bland, screen-saver aesthetics. At this point in a trilogy, nine hours in, that hollowness makes \u201cFire and Ash\u201d feel like almost theoretical drama: more avatar than genuine article.",
      "These movies have had to work extremely hard, moment to moment, just to pass as believable. But almost every gesture, every movement and every bit of dialogue has had something unnatural about it. (The high frame rate is partially to blame.) That\u2019s made these uncanny movies a combination, in equal measure, of things you\u2019ve never seen before, and things you can\u2019t unsee.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash,\u201d scripted by Cameron, Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver, picks up with the aftermath of the climatic battle of \u201cThe Way of Water.\u201d The Na\u2019vi and their seafaring allies, the Metkayina clan, are nursing their wounds and recovering the human weapons that sunk to the sea floor.",

      "When a rival clan called the Mangkwan or Ash People come to challenge the Na\u2019vi, those weapons represent an ethical quandary. Should they use such firepower in their own local battles? This is a more difficult question partially because the fire-mad Mangkwan are especially bloodthirsty, led by their slinky sorceress, Vanang (played with seductive sadism by Chaplin, granddaughter of Charlie).",
      "But their fight is only a piece of the larger war of \u201cFire and Ash.\u201d The focus of this third chapter (films four and five are said to be written but not greenlit) is interspecies coexistence. As human and Na\u2019vi lines continue to blur, the question becomes whether the human invaders will transform Pandora or if Pandora will transform them.",
      "That puts the focus on the three characters in various in-between states. First, there\u2019s Spider (Jack Champion), the human son of Quaritch who lives happily with the Na\u2019vi while breathing through a machine to survive the Pandora atmosphere. (Champion has the double misfortune of wearing a mask and looking downright puny next to the tall and slender natives.) But in \u201cFire and Ash,\u201d he discovers he can breathe unfiltered, a development that prompts intense military interest in a potentially hugely profitable breakthrough in Pandora assimilation.",
      "There\u2019s also Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the former human who has made a Na\u2019vi family with Neytiri (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). For Neytiri, the growing menace of human warfare causes her to doubt her bond with Jake. The prejudices of \u201cFire and Ash\u201d seep even into the home.",
      "Most interesting of the three, though, remains Quaritch. He may be violently trying to subjugate Pandora but he also obviously delights in his Na\u2019vi body and in his life on this distant moon. You can see him flinch when his commander, General Ardmore (Edie Falco), refers to their Mangkwan allies as \u201csavages.\u201d Meanwhile, Quaritch and Vanang hit it off like gangbusters.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got new eyes, colonel,\u201d one character tells Quaritch. \u201cAll you\u2019ve got to do is open them.\u201d",
      "The \u201cAvatar\u201d films have done plenty to open eyes over the past 16 years. To new cinematic horizons, to the boundlessness of Cameron's visions, to the Papyrus font. But the most endearing quality of \u201cAvatar\u201d is that Cameron believes so ardently in it. I might be caught up less in the goings on Pandora, but I'm kind of glad that he is. There are worse things than dreaming up a better world, with still a fighting chance.",
      "\u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d a 20th Century Studios release, opens in theaters Dec. 19. It's rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for intense sequences of violence and action, bloody images, some strong language, thematic elements and suggestive material. Running time: 195 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Summer's smooth blend of R&B, soul, pop, funk, rock, disco and electronica launched numerous chart-topping hits in the \u201870s and \u201980s as well as three multiplatinum albums. She won five Grammys. She was unstoppable \u2014 both as a performer and a writer.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to me because I know how important it was for Donna,\u201d said Sudano in a press release. \u201cThe backstory is, with all the accolades that she received over her career, being respected as a songwriter was always the thing that she felt was overlooked. So, for her to be accepted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame I know that she\u2019s very happy \u2026 somewhere.\u201d",
      "The Songwriters Hall of Fame was established in 1969. A songwriter with a notable catalog of songs qualifies for induction 20 years after the first commercial release of a song.",

      "\u201cThe play incorporates all the theatrical elements of early radio horror,\u201d writes Strand managing editor Andrew Gulli, \u201ca storm, howling wind, shadows, a house perched over the sea, flickering candles, mysterious footsteps on the stairs, spectral beings \u2014 as well as early hints of the themes and devices Williams would return to in his most famous later works: isolation, fear, the shades of gray between imagination and reality, and a house haunted by memory and the private terrors of those who inhabit it.\u201d",
      "Blanche DuBois would famously invoke \u201cthe kindness of strangers\u201d in Williams' classic \u201cA Streetcar Named Desire.\u201d You could call this early work \u201cThe Horror of Strangers.\u201d His play is set in a columned New England manor on the Atlantic coast, a \u201cghostly\u201d home squinting under a lighthouse beam that casts a yellowish spell. The title refers to invisible demons who haunt two of the home's residents, Mr. Brighton and Mrs. Brighton.",
      "\u201cWe members of the human species are equipped with only five senses. Or six at the very most,\u201d Mr. Brighton declares early on. \u201cThe Strangers are creatures that might be perceptible to us if we had seven or eight or maybe nine senses. But as it is, they exist just outside our little sphere of contact with reality and so \u2026 what we know of them is very, very slight.\u201d",

      "New York Jets defensive tackle Jowon Briggs surprised his teammates earlier this season by singing a song during a special teams meeting",
      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Jowon Briggs was sitting in a New York Jets special teams meeting earlier this season when Chris Banjo turned to him and made a request.",
      "\u201cI didn't know you could sing,\u201d said the special teams coordinator, who heard some buzz about Briggs' vocal talents. \"Man, go ahead and sing something.\"",
      "The spotlight was suddenly on the big defensive tackle. But Briggs is used to shining when it's time to perform \u2014 on and off the football field.",
      "So, remaining seated in a room full of teammates and coaches, the 6-foot-1, 313-pound tenor smoothly belted out Tevin Campbell's 1990s R&B hit, \u201cCan We Talk.\"",
      "\u201cI knew he could sing because he said he could, but then he sang in person \u2014 man, he has a beautiful voice,\u201d defensive tackle Harrison Phillips said.",
      "\u201cIt was crazy, actually,\u201d safety Isaiah Oliver recalled. \u201cI didn't know that about him prior to that meeting, so it was kind of shocking. But it was really good.\u201d",
      "So much so, Briggs received a standing ovation.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of guys were more surprised with, one, the song I sang, and then how it actually sounded,\" a smiling Briggs said. \"They were like, \u2018Oh, that can\u2019t be coming from Juwon!'\"",
      "But an even bigger surprise for some of Briggs' teammates is that he's a one-man band who has learned how to play 12 instruments to varying degrees of competency.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cLike I always say, everybody\u2019s got something. I just happen to be a musical guy.\u201d",
      "That's putting it lightly.",
      "There's Briggs' exceptional voice, of course. But he also has played the recorder, piano, violin, viola, cello, stand-up bass, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, saxophone, flute and harmonica, and still owns a few of them. Briggs has messed around with drums, too, but doesn\u2019t count that as part of his musical repertoire.",
      "\u201cI've never seen anybody who could play as many instruments and be so gifted vocally,\u201d defensive tackle Jay Tufele said. \u201cHe's a beast on the field and off.\u201d",
      "When it comes to football, Briggs has been one of the Jets' bright spots during a mostly dismal season. He has emerged as a pass-rushing, run-stuffing starter since replacing Quinnen Williams, who was traded last month to Dallas.",
      "The 24-year-old D-lineman wasn't even on the team until a few weeks before the regular season, when the seventh-round pick of Cleveland last year out of the University of Cincinnati was acquired by New York. He has 28 total tackles, six tackles for loss, a forced fumble, three sacks and nine quarterback hits.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a big man, he\u2019s strong,\u201d coach Aaron Glenn said. \"He\u2019s able to stop the run. He\u2019s been doing a good job of that, but what\u2019s been surprising \u2014 and I wouldn\u2019t say surprising \u2014 but what he\u2019s had the tick up in is his ability to rush the passer also. So, we want to be able to utilize that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying that he\u2019s Mean Joe Greene or anything like that, but listen, he\u2019s been doing a really good job of being disruptive in the pass game.\u201d",
      "Briggs grew up in Cincinnati with four older sisters, a younger brother and parents who all loved music and sports, making for a seamless duet of life-long passions.",
      "\u201cWith music, I\u2019d probably say it started from the womb,\u201d Briggs said with a laugh. \u201cI always say I kind of got the trickle-down effect. They\u2019ve all been singing, dancing, acting and playing sports since before I was even thought of, so I kind of just fell into a musical household.\"",
      "There were times one sibling would start playing an instrument, another would join, someone would start singing and then another would harmonize.",
      "\u201cWe had a very loud house,\u201d a smiling Briggs said. \u201cIt was kind of like \u2018Battle of the Bands.\u2019 It was a lot of fun. My sisters all sing better than I can, but if you grow up in that kind of competitive household, you find out if you can sing or not fairly quickly. So I was able to figure out that I was decent.\u201d",
      "And he was pretty good at making music, too.",

      "Behind the walkout are not only frayed labor relations, but a building itself under strain, with crumbling parts of the aging former palace now deemed unsafe.",
      "At the heart of the crisis lies a deeper rupture: a $102 million jewel heist that exposed security failures at the core of the institution and transformed long-simmering staff grievances into a national reckoning with global resonance.",
      "Tensions were already rising when a wildcat June strike abruptly shut the museum, stranding visitors beneath I.M. Pei\u2019s glass pyramid. Weeks later, the Louvre announced the closure of offices and a public gallery because of weakened floor beams, deepening concern about neglect across the aging complex.",

      "On Monday, the CFDT union said that 400 workers at a meeting voted to strike over chronic understaffing, deteriorating buildings and management decisions. Workers on Wednesday voted to extend the action, forcing the Louvre to operate on a restricted footing.",
      "The museum partially reopened a limited \u201cmasterpiece route,\u201d granting access to the \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d the Venus de Milo and a handful of galleries \u2014 a stopgap that allowed visitors inside while highlighting how far normal operations have slipped.",
      "Pressure has now shifted squarely onto Louvre President Laurence des Cars. The ministry has announced emergency anti-intrusion measures and appointed Philippe Jost, who oversaw the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral, to help reorganize the museum. It's a step widely read as a sign that confidence in existing governance has been shaken.",

      "A parliamentary inquiry described the Oct. 19 theft as one of the result of cascading failures. Only one of two cameras covering the break-in point was functioning, and security staff lacked enough screens to monitor footage in real time.",

      "Alex Warren's song \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025",
      "New York -- It jolted the winter, came alive in the spring, dominated the summer and went three-times platinum in the fall. Alex Warren's bombastic ballad \u201cOrdinary\u201d is, by many measures, a defining song of 2025. It's also an unusual hit: slower than a traditional song of the summer, full of gloss, an ascendent hook and inoffensive, religious-adjacent lyricism.",
      "For those reasons, \u201cOrdinary\u201d has fast-tracked the 25-year-old singer/songwriter into mainstream musical fame, coming to a head in November when he earned his first Grammy nomination. The nomination for best new artist arrived just four months after the release of his debut album, \u201cYou\u2019ll Be Alright, Kid.\u201d",
      "\u201cI bawled in my wife's arms,\u201d he said of the moment he found out about the nomination. For those who didn't believe in his music career, he says, \u201cthe biggest justification ever was the nomination.\u201d",
      "Most know Warren for \u201cOrdinary,\u201d but fame is not new for him. Before the chart-topping hit, Warren made a name for himself as a social media prankster in the TikTok collective \u201cHype House.\u201d And while that past might seem at odds with his new public persona, Warren always exuded perspicacity, the result of a troubled childhood that separated him from his comedic cohort. His father died of cancer when he was 9, he says, and his mother of complications due to alcoholism. A period of homelessness followed in his teens, before the TikTok fame.",
      "Still, he's remained curious and playful. At The Associated Press headquarters in New York, he chatted with staff and made disarming, self-deprecating comments. An example: In preparation to see the singer Shawn Mendes later, he dosed himself in cologne. \u201cI need to smell as good as Shawn Mendes looks,\u201d he joked.",
      "Social media success doesn't always yield a creative career \u2014 consider Warren and the innovative Addison Rae, a fellow best new artist nominee, exceptions to the rule \u2014 but it did prime him for the life he leads now. \u201cEverything that I went through back then definitely allowed me to do this,\u201d he says.",
      "Growing up online \u2014 and having \u201cdifferent versions\u201d of himself presented on social media \u2014 has \u201cdefinitely allowed me to now be unequivocally myself,\u201d he says.",
      "Warren wrote \u201cOrdinary\u201d a year ago at a writing camp. He says he knew there was something special about the track \u2014 though he and his collaborators were mostly alone in that feeling. \u201cA lot of people were like, \u2018Oh it\u2019s a ballad, it\u2019s a love song ballad. That\u2019s not a single, that\u2019s a song on the album. That\u2019s a feature, you should give it to someone else,\u2019\u201d he recalls. But he pushed it on TikTok, and soon, it connected.",
      "\u201cThe TikToks got it to do 4 million streams in a day, which was crazy,\u201d he said. Then he performed it on Netflix's \u201cLove Is Blind.\u201d He played it with Ed Sheeran,Jelly Roll, Luke Combs and the Jonas Brothers. It built to ubiquity.",

      "Gil Gerard, known for his role as Buck Rogers, has died at 82",
      "Gil Gerard, who played television's hunky sci-fi hero William \u201cBuck\u201d Rogers soon after the Star Wars franchise took hold in the late 1970s, has died. He was 82.",
      "Gerard died Tuesday in hospice as a result of a rare, aggressive form of cancer, said his manager, Tina Presley Borek. His wife, Janet Gerard, posted a posthumous Facebook message he left behind for fans that read in part:",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t waste your time on anything that doesn\u2019t thrill you or bring you love. See you out somewhere in the cosmos.\u201d",
      "Gerard starred in NBC's campy \u201cBuck Rogers in the 25th Century,\u201d which ran for two seasons from 1979 to 1981. A theatrical film based on the series also delighted youngsters and their parents alike. It was Rogers' second turn on TV after a show in the 1950s, a radio series and a 1939 film serial.",
      "The story was based on Philip Francis Nowlan's serialized 1928 pulp novella \u201cArmageddon 2419 A.D.\u201d Nowlan's character was named Anthony Rogers. The name was changed when the story began running in newspapers as a comic strip.",
      "\u201cMy life has been an amazing journey,\u201d Gerard wrote in his social media post. \u201cThe opportunities I\u2019ve had, the people I\u2019ve met and the love I have given and received have made my 82 years on the planet deeply satisfying.\u201d",
      "As the TV story goes, Rogers was a 20th century NASA pilot who was placed in frozen animation when his ship was hit by a meteor storm. He pops awake 500 years later in the year 2491. He gazes upon a futuristic, domed Earth with all its threats, including aliens, space pilots and the evil Draconians.",
      "He had helpers: The robot sidekick Twiki and a beautiful space pilot Wilma Deering, played by Erin Gray.",
      "A native of Little Rock, Arkansas, Gerard worked steadily in TV commercials. He was featured in a number of other TV shows and movies, including starring roles in the 1982 TV movie \u201cHear No Evil\u201d as Dragon and the short-lived \u201cSidekicks\u201d in 1986.",

      "\u201cAbsorbing all he had learned from his father Carl and his mentor Norman Lear, Rob Reiner not only was a great comic actor, he became a master story teller. There is no other director who has his range. From comedy to drama to \u2018mockumentary\u2019 to documentary he was always at the top of his game. He charmed audiences. They trusted him. They lined up to see his films,\" the group said in a statement released first to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cHis comedic touch was beyond compare, his love of getting the music of the dialogue just right, and his sharpening of the edge of a drama was simply elegant,\u201d it said of Rob Reiner, whose films included \u201cA Few Good Men,\u201d \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally...\" and \u201cThe Princess Bride.\"",
      "The statement was released two days after Rob and Michele Reiner were found dead in their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Their son, Nick Reiner, was charged Tuesday with two counts of murder and is suspected of stabbing his parents to death.",
      "The joint statement came from some of Reiner's longtime collaborators and contemporaries, including Crystal, Brooks, Short, David and their spouses. The signatories included writer Alan Zweibel, composer and lyricist Marc Shaiman, director Barry Levinson and former U.S. Ambassador to Spain James Costos.",
      "\u201cFor the actors, he loved them. For the writers he made them better. His greatest gift was freedom. If you had an idea, he listened, he brought you into the process. They always felt they were working as a team. To be in his hands as a film maker was a privilege but that is only part of his legacy,\u201d the statement said.",

As an acting piece, it\u2019s wonderful. And not many women have done it.

      "Creepy, zany and demonstrably fake content is often called \u201cslop.\u201d The word's proliferation online, in part thanks to the widespread availability of generative artificial intelligence, landed it Merriam-Webster's 2025 word of the year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s such an illustrative word,\" said Greg Barlow, Merriam-Webster's president, in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a transformative technology, AI, and it\u2019s something that people have found fascinating, annoying and a little bit ridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cSlop\u201d was first used in the 1700s to mean soft mud, but it evolved more generally to mean something of little value. The definition has since expanded to mean \"digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence.\"",
      "In other words, \u201cyou know, absurd videos, weird advertising images, cheesy propaganda, fake news that looks real, junky AI-written digital books,\u201d Barlow said.",
      "AI video generators like Sora have wowed with their ability to quickly create realistic clips based merely on text prompts. But a flood of these images on social media, including clips depicting celebrities and deceased public figures, has raised worries about misinformation, deepfakes and copyright.",
      "Such content has existed online for years, but the tools are more accessible now \u2014 and used to political ends by, among other figures, the head of the Pentagon. Last month, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth posted a manipulated image of a beloved cartoon turtle, reimagined as a grenade-wielding fighter, to defend U.S. military actions in Venezuela.",
      "The Canadian animated show \u201cFranklin\u201d teaches preschoolers about kindness, empathy and inclusivity \u2014 but in Hegseth's hands, its 6-year-old main character became a tool to promote violence.",
      "The word \u201cslop\u201d evokes unpleasant images of mud-caked pigs crowding around a dirty trough, or perhaps a bucket of steaming, fetid stew. Or AI amalgamations of algorithmic biases laden with offensive or nonsensical imagery.",
      "For some, the word induces dread.",
      "But to Barlow, it brings a sense of hope. The dictionary's president says the spike in searches for the word reflects that people have grown more aware of fake or shoddy content, and desire the inverse.",
      "\u201cThey want things that are real, they want things that are genuine,\" he said. \"It\u2019s almost a defiant word when it comes to AI. When it comes to replacing human creativity, sometimes AI actually doesn\u2019t seem so intelligent.\u201d",
      "To select the word of the year, the dictionary's editors review data about which words have risen in search results and usage. Then they come to a consensus about which word best reflects the span of the year.",
      "\u201cWe like to think that we are a mirror for people,\" Barlow said.",
      "Over the years, there are words that are consistently looked up, but they're filtered out as the dictionary's editors pick the one that best defines the year at hand.",
      "\u201cWords like \u2018ubiquitous,\u2019 \u2018paradigm,\u2019 \u2018albeit,\u2019 \u2018irregardless,\u2019 these are always top lookups because they\u2019re words that are on the edge of our lexicon,\" Barlow said. \u201c'Irregardless' is a word in the dictionary for one reason: It\u2019s used. It\u2019s been used for decades to mean \u2018regardless.\u2019\u201d",
      "The dictionary has selected one word every year since 2003 to capture and make sense of the current moment. Last year, shortly after the U.S. presidential election and amid the shifting national mood, Merriam-Webster chose the word \u201c polarization.\u201d",

      "The \"performative male\" is online shorthand for a disingenuous guy who pretends to like things women like in order to earn their trust. There's also a spate of influencers who've been called performative for posting surface-level \u201c kindness content.\u201d The word is versatile, since it extends to stunts in national politics, grandstanding on social media and even the nature of the UN General Assembly.",
      "There's a long national history of partisan gerrymandering in the U.S. To retain Republican control of Congress, President Donald Trump has urged maps to be redrawn before the 2026 midterm elections. That's led to GOP moves in Texas and Indiana to draw districts to their advantage, as well as a counter effort in Democrat-led California.",
      "The definition of this popular internet phrase is \u201cto participate in normal activities in the real world especially as opposed to online experiences and interactions.\u201d It was a serious contender for Merriam-Webster's word of the year, since it's used to \u201cdescribe the aspiration for many people to take a break from their digital addiction,\u201d Barlow said.",

      "Originally from Italian and Arabic for \u201cfree of charge,\u201d the word entered English centuries ago. The definition is \u201ca schedule of duties imposed by a government on imported or in some countries exported goods.\u201d",
      "Trump boasts that his tariffs protect American industries, lure factories to the U.S., raise money for the federal government and give him diplomatic leverage. But they've sparked a trade war and in reality account for less than 4% of federal revenue. The tariffs have also done little to dent the federal budget deficit \u2014 a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal 2025.",
      "Yes, you read that correctly. \u201cThe name of this lake delighted and baffled us when it started clogging the Top Lookups list on Merriam-Webster.com,\u201d the dictionary's editors said.

      "\u201cZootopia 2\u201d has regained the No. 1 spot at the box office with $26.3 million in its third weekend of release",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cZootopia 2\u201d regained the No. 1 spot at the domestic box office with $26.3 million in its third weekend of release, according to studio estimates Sunday, as The Walt Disney Co. animated sequel became the year\u2019s second film to gross $1 billion worldwide.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d arriving Friday, it was a relatively quiet weekend in theaters. There were no major new releases, leaving holdovers \u201cZootopia 2\u201d and \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d to duke it out for the top spot.",
      "The edge went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d which has quickly amassed $1.14 billion in global ticket sales thanks significantly to its enormous success in China. There, it\u2019s grossed $502.4 million, making \u201cZootopia 2\u201d the biggest Hollywood hit in the country in years.",
      "The only other 2025 Hollywood title to surpass $1 billion worldwide was Disney\u2019s \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d ($1.04 billion). The highest grossing movie of the year, though, is the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which collected nearly $2 billion just in China.",
      "In its second weekend of release, the Universal Pictures and Blumhouse Productions sequel \u201cFive Nights at Freddy\u2019s 2\u201d collected $15.4 million, a brutal drop of 70% from its above-expectations debut. Still, with a domestic total of $95.5 million, the $36 million production is a big win for Blumhouse, adding another horror franchise to its portfolio.",
      "The weekend\u2019s most notable new release was James L. Brook\u2019s \u201cElla McCay,\u201d his first directed film in 15 years. \u201cElla McCay\u201d earned a scant $2.1 million from 2,500 locations, making it one of the year\u2019s worst wide releases.",
      "But box-office expectations weren\u2019t high coming in from \u201cElla McCay,\u201d a comic drama about a 34-year-old woman (newcomer Emma Mackey) who becomes governor of her home state. Reviews (22% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes) were poor, and the kind of award-winning comic dramas movies that Brooks (\u201cTerms of Endearment,\u201d \u201cBroadcast News\u201d) has long specialized in today seldom find large audiences in theaters. \u201cElla McCay,\u201d featuring a supporting cast including Jamie Lee Curtis, Ayo Edebiri and Woody Harrelson, cost $35 million to make.",
      "With overall ticket sales on the year running close to even with last year's disappointing grosses, according to Comscore data, Hollywood will be hoping the coming holiday corridor, traditionally the busiest moviegoing period of the year, ends 2025 on a high note. Movies on tap include \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash,\u201d \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Search for SquarePants,\u201d \u201cMarty Supreme,\u201d \u201cAnaconda\u201d and \u201cSong Sung Blue.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data",
      "NEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.",
      "When Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.",
      "A week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.",
      "Gupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.",
      "Residents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.",
      "\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"",
      "Environmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.",
      "Experts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.",
      "India\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.",
      "The monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.",
      "In 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.",
      "The program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.",
      "However, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.",
      "A 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.",
      "\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.",
      "A study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.",
      "Yet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.",

      "\u201cAs a consequence of exposure to air pollution, we see a lot of preterm births, miscarriages, low birth weight. Exposure at this stage has a lifelong consequence,\u201d she said.",

      "Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said Tuesday in a news release that China is demanding a public apology from the state in a complaint filed in the Intermediate People\u2019s Court of Wuhan. The Chinese government also is seeking compensation equivalent to $50.5 billion plus legal fees and the right to claim further compensation.",
      "\"This lawsuit is a stalling tactic and tells me that we have been on the right side of this issue all along,\u201d Hanaway said in the news release.",
      "At issue is a lawsuit Missouri filed alleging that China hoarded personal protective equipment during the early months of the pandemic, harming the state and its residents. A federal judge ruled for Missouri earlier this year after China declined to participate in the trial. It called the lawsuit \u201c very absurd \u201d when it was filed in 2020.",
      "Last month, Missouri escalated its efforts to collect, asking the U.S. State Department to formally notify China that the state intends to pursue assets with full or partial Chinese government ownership to satisfy the judgment.",
      "Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that he wasn\u2019t familiar with the specifics of the new case. But he said the earlier Missouri lawsuit was \u201ca purely politically motivated maneuver.\u201d",

But an appeals court allowed one part of the lawsuit to proceed: the allegation that China hoarded personal protective equipment, such as respirator masks, medical gowns and gloves.",
      "After Chinese officials didn\u2019t respond, Limbaugh accepted Missouri\u2019s estimate of past and potential future damages of more than $8 billion, tripled it as federal law allows, and added 3.91% interest until it\u2019s collected.",
      "The lawsuit was originally filed by state Attorney General Eric Schmitt, an ally of President Donald Trump who subsequently won election to the U.S. Senate, and alleged that Chinese officials were to blame for the pandemic. It was carried on by Attorney General Andrew Bailey, another Trump ally who resigned in September to become co-deputy director of the FBI.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A former leading scientist at the National Institutes of Health sued the Trump administration Tuesday, saying she was illegally fired for warning that abrupt research cuts were endangering patients and public health.",
      "The NIH has cut billions of dollars in research projects since President Donald Trump took office in January, bypassing the usual scientific funding process. The cuts included clinical trials testing treatments for cancer, brain diseases and other health problems that a recent report said impacted over 74,000 people enrolled in the experiments.",
      "Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo is a well-known HIV expert who led NIH\u2019s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Last spring, Marrazzo was put on administrative leave after she challenged NIH officials about the cuts.

      "Severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of schools and youth training centers in camps for Rohingya in Bangladesh and crippled child protection pr...",
      "UKHIYA, Bangladesh -- In moments when she is alone, when there is a break in the beatings from her husband, the girl cries for the school that was once her place of peace in a world that has otherwise offered her none.",
      "Ever since the military in her homeland of Myanmar killed her father in 2017, forcing her to flee to neighboring Bangladesh with her mother and little sisters, the school had protected Hasina from the predators who prowl her refugee camp, home to 1.2 million members of Myanmar\u2019s persecuted Rohingya minority.",
      "It had also protected her from being forced into marriage. And then one day in June, when Hasina was 16 years old, her teacher announced that the school\u2019s funding had been taken away. The school was closing. In a blink, Hasina\u2019s education was over, and so, too, was her childhood.",
      "With her learning opportunities gone, and her family worried that foreign aid cuts would make their fight for survival in the camps even more perilous, Hasina \u2014 along with hundreds of other girls under the age of 18 \u2014 was quickly married off. And, just like Hasina, many of the girls are now trapped in marriages with men who abuse them.",
      "\u201cI dreamed of being something, of working for the community,\u201d Hasina, now 17, says softly. The Associated Press is withholding her full name to protect her from retaliation by her husband. \u201cMy life is destroyed.\u201d",
      "The sudden and severe foreign aid cuts imposed this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, along with funding reductions from other countries, shuttered thousands of the camps\u2019 schools and youth training centers and crippled child protection programs. Beyond unwanted marriages, scores of children as young as 10 were forced into backbreaking manual labor, and girls as young as 12 forced into prostitution. With no safe space to play or learn, children were left to wander the labyrinthine camps, making them increasingly easy targets for kidnappers. And the young and desperate were picked off by traffickers who promised to restore what the children had lost: Hope.",
      "In a sweltering building not far from the cramped shelter where her husband tortures her, Hasina plays nervously with the strap of her pink mobile phone case, emblazoned with the words \u201cForever Young.\u201d",
      "She is still young, she says. But the aid cuts forced her into womanhood and into a nightmare. Not long after marrying her husband, she says, he isolated her from her family and began to beat and sexually abuse her. She daydreams daily of school, where she was a whiz at English and hoped to become a teacher. Now, she is confined largely to her shelter, cooking and cleaning and waiting with dread for the next beating.",
      "If she had any way to escape, she says, she would. But there is nowhere to go. She cannot return to Myanmar, where the military that killed thousands of Rohingya in 2017 during what the U.S. declared a genocide remains in charge of her homeland.",
      "Now, her husband is in charge of her future, though she no longer sees one.",
      "\u201cIf the school hadn\u2019t closed,\u201d she says, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be trapped in this life.\u201d",
      "Life has always been dangerous for the 600,000 children languishing in these chaotic, overcrowded camps, where a squalid jumble of bamboo and tarpaulin shelters are jammed onto landslide-prone hills. But Trump\u2019s decision in January to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development has made it even more so, the AP found in interviews with 37 children, family members, teachers, community leaders and aid workers.",
      "Violations against children in the camps have risen sharply this year, according to UNICEF, the United Nations\u2019 children\u2019s agency. Between January and mid-November, reported cases of abduction and kidnapping more than quadrupled over the same time period last year, to 560 children. And there has been an eightfold increase in reports of armed groups\u2019 recruitment and use of children for training and support roles in the camps, with 817 children affected. Many members of the armed groups are battling a powerful ethnic militia across the border in Myanmar. The actual number of cases is likely higher due to underreporting, according to UNICEF, which lost 27% of its funding due to the U.S. aid cuts and subsequently shuttered nearly 2,800 schools.",
      "\u201cThe armed groups, with their roots in Myanmar, are operating in the camps, using the camps as a fertile ground for recruiting young people,\u201d says Patrick Halton, a child protection manager for UNICEF. \u201cObviously, if children are not in learning centers and not in multipurpose centers, then they\u2019re more vulnerable to this.\u201d",
      "Verified cases of child marriage, which the U.N. defines as the union of children under age 18, rose by 21% and verified child labor cases by 17% in the year to September, compared to the same time period last year. Those statistics are likely to be a significant undercount, says Halton.",
      "\u201cWith the funding cuts, we had to downscale a lot in terms of the education,\u201d Halton says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant that children have not necessarily had things to do, and we\u2019ve therefore seen this rise in children being married, children being in child labor.\u201d",
      "Though the U.S. spent just 1% of its budget on foreign aid, Trump dubbed USAID wasteful and shut it down, a move that has proven catastrophic for the world\u2019s most vulnerable. In Myanmar, the AP found the aid cuts have caused children to starve to death, despite U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s statement to Congress that \u201cNo one has died\u201d because of the dissolution of USAID. A study published in The Lancet journal in June said the U.S. funding cuts could result in more than 14 million deaths, including more than 4.5 million children under age 5, by 2030.",
      "In the Bangladesh camps, the U.S. \u2014 which has long been the biggest provider of aid to the predominantly Muslim Rohingya \u2014 slashed its funding by nearly half compared to last year. The overall Rohingya emergency response is only 50% funded for 2025, and aid agencies say next year is expected to be far worse.",
      "In a statement to the AP, the State Department said the U.S. has provided more than $168 million to the Rohingya since the beginning of Trump\u2019s term, although data from the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service show the U.S. contribution in 2025 is $156 million. Asked about the disparity, the State Department said the U.N.\u2019s financial tracking service had not been recently updated and \u201cgenerally does not show the latest information on all U.S. funding.\u201d",
      "The department said it had \u201cadvanced burden sharing and improved efficiency\u201d in the Rohingya response, resulting in 11 countries increasing their funding by more than 10% year on year, collectively contributing $72 million.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration continues to pursue the diplomatic efforts to encourage additional countries to help shoulder the burden,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The department didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for evidence that the U.S. had influenced other countries\u2019 funding decisions for the Rohingya response.",
      "When the schools shut down, hundreds of underage girls \u2014 some as young as 14 \u2014 were married off, says Showkutara, executive director of the Rohingya Women Association for Education and Development. Her network of contacts across the camps have also reported an increase in kidnapping and trafficking, as well as a huge surge in the prostitution of girls as young as 12 since the aid cuts.",
      "\u201cAfter the school closures, they had no space to play. ... That\u2019s why they\u2019re playing on the roads, far away from their blocks,\u201d says Showkutara, who goes by one name. \u201cThere are some groups who are targeting the children.\u201d",
      "While UNICEF managed to repurpose some of its remaining funding, enabling the agency to recently reopen most of its learning centers, scores of schools run by other aid groups are still shut, and thousands of children remain out of class. And aid workers are anticipating even steeper funding cuts next year, leaving the schools\u2019 futures uncertain. Save the Children has only secured a third of its funding target for life-saving services for 2026, meaning 20,000 children attending its schools are at risk of losing their education starting in January, says Golam Mostofa, the group\u2019s area director for Cox\u2019s Bazar, the closest city to the camps.",
      "Meanwhile, Showkutara says, the children locked out of learning by the initial closures are forever lost: Both metaphorically, in the case of girls like Hasina who were married off to men who will never let them return to school even if they reopen, and literally, in the case of children who vanished into the trafficking network.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d she says.",
      "The little boy sits slumped on a plastic stool under the punishing sun, his cheeks streaked with sweat, a cooler of freeze pops and other treats at his dirty feet. Ever since 10-year-old Mohammed Arfan\u2019s school closed, this is where he spends 10 hours a day, seven days a week, selling snacks and daydreaming of the small schoolroom where he once felt safe and loved.",
      "He had just finished his math lessons the day that his teacher told him the school\u2019s funding was gone. As he walked home, he and his friends began to cry.",
      "\u201cI thought that I would not see my friends anymore, and that I was losing my future,\u201d he says.",
      "With no lessons to occupy his time, and his parents worried about their seven children\u2019s survival, Arfan\u2019s mother told him he would need to work to help keep the family fed.",
      "He was terrified. If the camp\u2019s kidnappers or thieves targeted him while he was working, he knew he was too small to fight back.",

Then, hoisting the 15-kilogram (30-pound) cooler upon his bony shoulder, he walks another 30 minutes to the corner of the dusty road where he sets up shop among the garbage, rotting banana peels and swarms of flies. For his efforts, he takes home around 200 to 300 taka ($1.60 to $2.50) a day.",

      "His eye blazes with blood from the bamboo that pierced it 10 days earlier while slogging through the sewage. He began coming here soon after his school shut down, in the hopes he could collect enough trash to pay the 500 taka ($4) a month fee for private lessons. Many months, that fee has remained out of reach.",
      "He worries he will drown in the ditch. And he worries that his dreams of becoming a camp official or a teacher will never come true.",
      "Back on the street corner, Arfan, too, feels his dreams dying. He shouldn\u2019t be here, he says, voice barely audible above the incessant shrieking of horns from the rickshaws racing past, just inches from his cooler.",

      "The laughter that once filled Noor Zia\u2019s classroom has been replaced by tears. Nearly every day, she says, her former students stop by to see if the school has reopened, only to break down when told it has not.",
      "Zia often finds herself in tears, too. Before the aid cuts, she was the head teacher of 21 early learning centers that served 630 children aged 3-5. But the closures left her without a job, making it even harder for her to keep her family alive on the camp\u2019s meager rations.",
      "\u201cMy heart is still crying, because my family depends on this job,\u201d she says, sitting in the empty classroom, where the wall behind her is adorned with a drawing of the Myanmar flag \u2014 a country most of her students, born in the camps, have never seen.",
      "The funding cuts\u2019 pain goes beyond the school closures. Skills development programs that kept thousands of children occupied were also halted. Healthcare, nutrition and sanitation services have been reduced. In camps crawling with scabies and other diseases, the results of the reductions are clear on the children\u2019s scrawny bodies. Lesions line their slender limbs. The wet, rattling coughs of babies fill the fetid air. Atop a muddy hill, clusters of kids scratch ferociously at their heads, while a 4-year-old stoically plucks nits from her friend\u2019s scalp.",
      "Bangladesh has barred the Rohingya from leaving the camps to find work, so they are reliant upon humanitarian aid to survive. But the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which had counted the U.S. as its largest donor, says it only has enough funds to continue providing food rations through March.",
      "The prospect of a ration cut has terrified families. With no country offering the Rohingya large-scale resettlement, many have opted to make a run for it, with devastating results. Nearly a third of the 1,340 Rohingya who have fled Bangladesh by boat this year have died or gone missing en route, according to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.",
      "Noor Kaida, a 17-year-old whose dreams of becoming a doctor were dashed when she was married off after her school shut, says she has lost two young relatives to traffickers. Shattered by the school closures, the 13- and 16-year-old girls believed traffickers who promised them a better life in Malaysia, Kaida says. Other passengers on the girls\u2019 boats later told Kaida\u2019s family both girls were killed; one by drowning, and the other at the hands of a trafficker.",
      "\u201cIf the school wasn\u2019t closed, they wouldn\u2019t have had to take these risks,\u201d Kaida says. \u201cBecause of the funding cuts and the school closures, thousands of girls were scattered in different places and their lives have been ruined.\u201d",
      "The 13-year-old boy had been missing for nine days when the call came in from an unfamiliar number.",
      "\u201cBaba, I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Mohammed told his frantic father. \u201cI\u2019m on the big boat now. Pray for me.\u201d",
      "The call disconnected, and Mohib Ullah knew his worst nightmare had come true: Just like so many other children in recent months, his boy had been taken by traffickers. Ullah \u2014 who has no relation to Rahamot Ullah \u2014 called back again and again, but the phone was switched off.",
      "Mohammed \u2014 whose full name the AP is withholding for safety reasons \u2014 had been miserable since his school closed. The kindhearted boy who loved to read and learn, especially English, had long dreamed of becoming a teacher. When his education ended, he told his father through tears that his life was over. Ullah promised to try and find money for private school, but as a widower caring for four children, it was impossible.",
      "The teen hatched a plan, which he shared in secret with his big sister, Bibi: He would go with a trafficker to Malaysia, and find a future there. Bibi tried to talk him out of it; traffickers who take children on the long, dangerous journey generally detain the youngsters at the end until their parents pay a fee for their release. The children of parents who can\u2019t pay are often tortured, and sometimes killed. Bibi warned her brother that their father would never be able to afford the trafficker\u2019s payment.",
      "But Mohammed didn\u2019t care. \u201cIt\u2019s better to withstand two years of torture than stay here in a hopeless camp,\u201d he told his sister. \u201cIt\u2019s better to die if I can\u2019t continue learning.\u201d",
      "In a panic, Bibi shared her brother\u2019s plan with their father, who was horrified; he knew how deadly the journey to Malaysia can be. He ordered his son to stay put, and to stay patient. The schools will reopen someday, he assured Mohammed. But the teen was convinced they would not.",
      "And so, one morning in October, Mohammed left his family\u2019s shelter and never returned. Ullah scoured the camps and called relatives, searching for any trace of his son. He couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t eat. He has already lost another son, an 8-year-old who suddenly died on the anniversary of Ullah\u2019s wife\u2019s death, after crying all day about missing his mother and then saying he felt unwell. The prospect of losing one more child was unbearable.",
      "Mohammed\u2019s call came on Oct. 21. And then, for over six weeks, there was silence.",
      "On Dec. 6, Ullah\u2019s phone finally rang. It was Mohammed \u2014 still alive, but sick and sobbing. The traffickers were demanding 380,000 taka ($3,100) for his release \u2014 an astronomical sum that Ullah told Mohammed he did not have. But the terrified boy begged his father to try and find it.",
      "Ullah knew if couldn\u2019t, his son would likely be killed. And so he pleaded with anyone he could think of for any money they could spare. In the end, he collected just enough, and Mohammed was set free in Malaysia.",
      "Ullah does not know what will become of his boy, who is still so young and wandering around a country that is alien to him.",
      "\u201cIf he could have continued his studies, he could have been a teacher, he could have stayed near me,\u201d Ullah says, blinking back tears. \u201cNow he\u2019s left me and I can\u2019t see him. So I lost my dream, too.\u201d",
      "His voice cracks as he describes what was long one of his greatest joys: The sight of his son coming home from school, backpack slung across his shoulders.",
      "Now, the stacks of workbooks Mohammed once pored over sit in his bedroom, untouched. His brown sandals are propped against the wall, alongside the sparkly pink sneakers belonging to the sister who tried in vain to stop him.",
      "And, hanging from a piece of bamboo, gathering dust, is his backpack.",

      "Hochul, a Catholic, said she came to the decision after hearing from New Yorkers in the \u201cthroes of pain and suffering,\u201d as well as their children, while also considering opposition from \u201cindividuals of many faiths who believe that deliberately shortening one\u2019s life violates the sanctity of life.\u201d",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a drug that boosts libido in women who report stress due to a low sex drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. health officials have expanded approval of a much-debated drug aimed at boosting female libido, saying the once-a-day pill can now be taken by postmenopausal women up to 65 years old.",
      "The announcement Monday from the Food and Drug Administration broadens the drug's use to older women who have gone through menopause. The pill, Addyi, was first approved 10 years ago for premenopausal women who report emotional stress due to low sex drive.",
      "Addyi, marketed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, was initially expected to become a blockbuster drug, filling an important niche in women's health. But the drug came with unpleasant side effects including dizziness and nausea, and it carries a safety warning about the dangers of combining it with alcohol.",
      "The boxed warning cautions that drinking while consuming the pill can cause dangerously low blood pressure and fainting. If patients have several drinks, the label recommends waiting a few hours before taking the drug, or skipping one dose.",
      "Sales of Addyi, which acts on brain chemicals that affect mood and appetite, fell short of Wall Street's initial expectations. In 2019, the FDA approved a second drug for low female libido, an on-demand injection that acts on a different set of neurological chemicals.",
      "Sprout CEO Cindy Eckert said in a statement the approval \u201creflects a decade of persistent work with the FDA to fundamentally change how women\u2019s sexual health is understood and prioritized.\u201d The company, based in Raleigh, North Carolina, announced the FDA update in a press release Monday.",
      "The medical condition for a troublingly low sexual appetite, called hypoactive sexual desire disorder, has been recognized since the 1990s and is thought to affect a significant portion of American women, according to surveys. After the blockbuster success of Viagra for men in the 1990s, drugmakers began pouring money into research and potential therapies for sexual dysfunction in women.",
      "But diagnosing the condition is complicated because of how many factors can affect libido, especially after menopause, when falling hormone levels trigger a number of biological changes and medical symptoms. Doctors are supposed to rule out a number of other issues, including relationship problems, medical conditions, depression and other mental disorders, before prescribing medication.",

The vaccine is credited with preventing thousands of illnesses.",
      "Monarez, a former director of a federal biomedical research agency, was named acting director of the CDC in January. Trump later nominated her to serve as director. She was confirmed by the Senate in July, making her the first nonphysician to serve in the role. But she was fired by the Trump administration in August after less than a month in the post.",

      "The warm scents of gingerbread and pine are holiday favorites, but experts warn they can affect indoor air quality",
      "The warm spices in gingerbread, the woodsy aroma of pine and fir trees, and the fruity tang of mulled wine are smells synonymous with the holiday season. Many people enjoy lighting candles, incense and fireplaces in their homes to evoke the moods associated with these festive fragrances.",
      "Burning scented products may create a cozy ambiance, and in the case of fireplaces, provide light and heat, but some experts want people to consider how doing so contributes to the quality of the air indoors. All flames release chemicals that may cause allergy-like symptoms or contribute to long-term respiratory problems if they are inhaled in sufficient quantities.",
      "However, people don't have to stop sitting by the hearth or get rid of products like perfumed candles and essential oil diffusers, said Dr. Meredith McCormack, director of the pulmonary and critical care medicine division at John Hopkins University\u2019s medical school. Instead, she recommends taking precautions to control the pollutants in their homes.",
      "\u201cClean air is fragrance free,\u201d said McCormack, who has studied air quality and lung health for more than 20 years. \u201cIf having seasonal scents is part of your tradition or evokes feelings of nostalgia, maybe think about it in moderation.\u201d",
      "People in the Northern Hemisphere tend to spend more time indoors during the end-of-year holidays, when temperatures are colder. Indoor air can be significantly more polluted than outdoor air because pollutants get trapped inside and concentrated without proper ventilation or filtration, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "For example, active fireplaces and gas appliances release tiny airborne particles that can get into the lungs and chemicals like nitrogen dioxide, a major component of smog, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Cleaning products, air fresheners and candles also emit air pollutants at varying concentrations.",
      "The risk fragrances and other air pollutants may pose to respiratory health depends on the source, the length and intensity of a person\u2019s exposure, and individual health, McCormack said.",
      "It is also important to note that some pollutants have no smell, so unscented products still can affect indoor air quality, experts say.",
      "Polluted air affects everyone but not equally. Children, older adults, minority populations and people of low socioeconomic status are more likely to be affected by poor air quality because of either physiological vulnerabilities or higher exposure, according to the environmental agency.",
      "Children are more susceptible to air pollution because of their lung size, which means they get a greater dose of exposure relative to their body size, McCormack said. Pollutants inside the home also post a greater hazard to people with heart or lung conditions, including asthma, she said.",
      "Signs of respiratory irritation include coughing, shortness of breath, headaches, a runny nose and sneezing. Experts advise stopping use of pollutant-releasing products or immediately ventilating rooms if symptoms occur.",

      "Wilkowe said she leans toward candles made with soy-based waxes instead of petroleum-based paraffin. Experts note that all lit candles give off air pollutants regardless of what they are made of.",
      "Buying products with fewer ingredients, opening windows if the temperatures allow, and using air purifiers with HEPA filters are ways to reduce exposure to any pollutants from indoor fireplaces, appliances and candle displays, McCormack said. She also recommends switching on kitchen exhaust fans before starting a gas-powered stovetop and using the back burners so the vent can more easily suck up pollutants.",
      "Setting polite boundaries with guests who smoke cigarettes or other tobacco products is also a good idea, she said.",
      "\u201cSmall improvements in air quality can have measurable health benefits,\" McCormack said. \"Similarly to if we exercise and eat a little better, we can be healthier.\u201d",

      "BRUSSELS -- Belgium insisted on Thursday that its European Union partners must provide ironclad guarantees that it will be protected from Russian retaliation before it would back a massive loan for Ukraine.",
      "At a high-stakes EU summit in Brussels, the 27-nation bloc\u2019s leaders are set to decide on whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine\u2019s military and financial needs over the next two years.",
      "The bulk of the assets \u2014 some 193 billion euros ($227 billion) as of September \u2014 are held in the Brussels-based financial clearing house Euroclear. Russia\u2019s Central Bank sued Euroclear last week.",
      "\u201cGive me a parachute and we\u2019ll all jump together,\u201d Prime Minister Bart De Wever told members of the Belgian parliament just before the summit began. \u201cIf we have confidence in the parachute that shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d",
      "Belgium fears that Russia will strike back and would prefer that the bloc borrow the money on international markets. It wants frozen assets held in other European countries to be thrown into the pot as well, and for its partners to guarantee that Euroclear will have the funds it needs should it come under legal attack.",
      "European officials say Russia is waging a campaign of sabotage and disruption across the continent. The Central Bank lawsuit ramped up pressure on Belgium and its European partners ahead of the summit.",
      "The \u201creparations loan\u201d plan would see the EU give 90 billion euros ($106 billion) to Ukraine. Countries like the U.K., Canada and Norway would make up any shortfall.",
      "Russia's claim to the assets would still stand, but the assets would remain locked away at least until the Kremlin ends its war on Ukraine and pays for the massive damage it's caused.",
      "In mapping out the loan plan, the European Commission set up safeguards to protect Belgium, but De Wever remains unconvinced.",
      "\u201cI have not yet seen a text that could satisfactorily address Belgium\u2019s concerns,\" he said. \"I hope to see one today.\u201d",
      "De Wever insisted that Belgium remains \u201ca faithful ally\u201d of Ukraine and wants to continue to help.",
      "Whatever method they use, the leaders have pledged to meet most of Ukraine's needs in 2026 and 2027. The International Monetary Fund estimates that would amount to 137 billion euros ($160 billion). The war-ravaged country is at risk of bankruptcy and needs the money by spring.",
      "\u201cWe have to find a solution today,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters. EU Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa, who is chairing the meeting, has vowed to keep leaders negotiating until an agreement is reached, even if it takes days.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said: \u201cNow we have a simple choice. Either money today or blood tomorrow.\" He insisted that \"all European leaders have to rise to the occasion.\u201d",
      "EU envoys have worked around the clock in recent weeks to flesh out the details and narrow differences among the 27 member countries. If enough countries object, the plan could be blocked. There is no majority support for a plan B of raising the funds on international markets.",
      "\u201cAt this stage, it depends on political will,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Whatsapp chat with reporters while flying to Brussels. \u201cI very much hope that we can obtain a positive decision. Without it, Ukraine will face a major problem.\u201d",

      "Belarus' authoritarian president said Thursday that Russia had deployed its latest nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile system to the country, a move that comes as talks to end the war in Ukraine have entered a crucial phase.",
      "President Alexander Lukashenko said the Oreshnik, an intermediate range ballistic missile system, arrived in the country on Wednesday and is entering combat duty. He didn't say how many missiles have been deployed or give any other details.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that the Oreshnik will enter combat duty this month but didn't give any other details.

      "Russia previously has deployed tactical nuclear weapons to the territory of its Belarus, whose territory it used to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Lukashenko has earlier said that his country has several dozen Russian tactical nuclear weapons.",
      "Russia first tested a conventionally armed version of the Oreshnik \u2014 Russian for hazelnut tree \u2014 to strike a Ukrainian factory in November 2024, and Putin has boasted that it\u2019s impossible to intercept.

      "The Russian leader has bragged that Oreshnik\u2019s multiple warheads plunge at speeds of up to Mach 10 and can\u2019t be intercepted, and that several of them used in a conventional strike could be as devastating as a nuclear attack. Russian state media boasted that it would take the missile only 11 minutes to reach an air base in Poland and 17 minutes to reach NATO headquarters in Brussels.

      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s ours,\u201d said Devon Carter, a research officer with the nonprofit Anguilla National Trust. \u201cWe don\u2019t have lions, we don\u2019t have elephants, but what we do have, we need to appreciate.\u201d",
      "The population of the Lesser Antillean iguana, also known as Iguana delicatissima, was zero on Prickly Pear East Cay nearly a decade ago.",
      "But scientists in nearby Anguilla who were determined to save the species from extinction tucked 10 iguanas into small, breathable cotton bags and ferried them by boat to the cay with no predators in hopes they would breed.",
      "And breed they did. The population has surged to 300 and counting, converting the cay into one of five sites worldwide where the iguana is trying to make a comeback. It is estimated that there are fewer than 20,000 species remaining, according to conservation groups.",
      "\u201cPrickly Pear East has become a beacon of hope for these gorgeous lizards and proves that when we give native wildlife the chance, they know what to do,\u201d said Jenny Daltry, Caribbean alliance director for the conservation groups Fauna & Flora and Re:wild.",
      "Indigenous people are estimated to have arrived in the eastern Caribbean roughly 7,000 years ago.",
      "The Lesser Antillean iguanas were already there, likely having reached the islands by floating atop debris spewed by rivers that had burst their banks in South America, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "At the time, the iguanas inhabited some 10 islands, but they are now extinct on Antigua, Barbuda, St. Kitts, Nevis and St. Martin, and have largely vanished from Guadeloupe, St. Barts and Martinique, according to the Re:wild conservation group.",
      "Its biggest threat? The green, or stripe-tailed, iguana. Originally from Central and South America, it was introduced to Guadeloupe in the 1800s and then spread to other islands thanks to Hurricane Luis, which pummeled the northeast Caribbean in 1995.",
      "The green iguanas have more offspring, they are more territorial and they eat more food than the Lesser Antillean iguanas.",
      "But the biggest issue is that both species mate with each other.",
      "\u201cIt really jeopardizes the genetic viability,\u201d said Isabel Curtis, a conservation officer with Anguilla National Trust. \u201cIf your genetics are diluted, your species as a whole can\u2019t continue.\u201d",
      "So in 2015, scientists in Anguilla armed themselves with long poles with a noose at the end to lasso Lesser Antillean iguanas and transport them to Prickly Pear East, where there are no dogs, cats, traffic, green iguanas or other deadly threats.",

      "The iguanas were genetically tested to ensure they were full breeds and then the first 10 were tagged and released on nearby Prickly Pear East, Mukhida said.",

      "\u201cWe were seeing babies, we were seeing their burrows where they were nesting,\u201d Mukhida recalled. \u201cIt was really encouraging that they were breeding.\u201d",
      "Lesser Antillean iguanas are bright green when young but morph into a slate gray or dusty black as adults, with a lifespan of more than 20 years in the wild.",
      "But concerns remained despite the successful breeding.",
      "Scientists reached out to officials in the eastern Caribbean island of Dominica to obtain more female iguanas in a bid to boost the genetic diversity of the lizards procreating in Prickly Pear East. Dominica has the region's largest population of Lesser Antillean iguanas, but they too are now threatened by green iguanas that arrived after Hurricane Maria hit the region in 2017.",
      "The petition was sent during the pandemic, so Carter and other scientists had to quarantine first before traveling to Dominica. Once there, they built homes for the captured iguanas, monitored their health and ran DNA tests to make sure they weren\u2019t hybrid iguanas.",

      "\u201cThose are the ones you remember the most,\u201d he said, adding that he nicknamed one of them \u201cGreen.\u201d",

      "The 47-meter (154-foot) tall column, built between A.D. 180 and 193, features a relief that spirals upward and recounts the battles of one of Rome\u2019s best-known emperors, Marcus Aurelius. During the column\u2019s last restoration, in the 1980s, restorers used tiny brushes to remove the dirt.",
      "For a rare, up-close peek at the restoration, a group of journalists tramped up 16 levels of scaffolding \u2014 though their numbers progressively diminished as those with fear of heights turned back.",
      "\u201cThe laser gives us an excellent result,\u201d said Marta Baumgartner, the director of restoration works. \u201cIt works faster and above all allows a great respect for the material \u2014 for the marble and for the surface layers.\u201d",
      "Ancient artists did not hold back on the gory details of war. As the relief twists upward, it depicts soldiers dragging women with children off by their hair. Decapitated enemies lie on the ground, horses rear in the heat of battle and war prisoners look terrified with their necks bound together.",
      "In addition to debuting the short-pulse lasers, the group of 18 restorers use chemical wraps, sponges and resin to erase dirt from the smog in the Italian capital and fill holes created by water freezing in cold weather and expanding within. The monument has also suffered from erosion that has erased some of the faces of the engraved figures.",

      "The 2-million-euro ($2.3-million) restoration is funded by the post-pandemic European recovery fund, and includes a new system to illuminate the column at night. Work began in April and the restoration is expected to finish in June.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has made a significant U.S. appointment by naming Bishop Ronald Hicks as the next archbishop of New York",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV on Thursday made his most important U.S. appointment to date, naming a fellow Chicagoan as the next archbishop of New York to lead one of the biggest U.S. archdioceses as it navigates relations with the Trump administration and its immigration crackdown.",
      "Bishop Ronald Hicks, the current bishop of Joliet, Illinois, replaces the retiring Cardinal Timothy Dolan, a prominent conservative figure in the U.S. Catholic hierarchy. Hicks takes over after Dolan last week finalized a plan to establish a $300 million fund to compensate victims of sexual abuse who had sued the archdiocese.",
      "Dolan had submitted his resignation in February, as required when he turned 75. But the Vatican often waits to make important leadership changes in dioceses if there is lingering abuse litigation or other governance matters that need to be resolved by the outgoing bishop.",
      "The handover, though, represents a significant new chapter for the U.S. Catholic Church, which is forging a new era with the Chicago-born Leo as the first American pope. Leo and the U.S. hierarchy have already shown willingness to challenge the Trump administration on immigration and other issues, and Hicks is seen as very much a Leo-style bishop.",
      "Hicks, 58, grew up in South Holland, Illinois, a short distance from the suburban Chicago childhood home of Leo, the former Robert Prevost.",
      "Like Prevost, who spent 20 years as a missionary in Peru, Hicks worked for five years in El Salvador heading a church-run orphanage program that operated in nine Latin American and Caribbean countries.",
      "\u201cTaking a new position as archbishop of New York is an enormous responsibility, but I can honestly say that Bishop Hicks is up to the task,\u201d said the Rev. Eusebius Martis, who has known Hicks since the mid-1980s and worked with him at Mundelein Seminary, the Chicago archdiocesan seminary.",
      "\u201cHe is a wonderful man, always thoughtful and attentive to the needs of seminarians,\u201d Martis, professor of sacramental theology at the Pontifical Liturgical Institute of Sant\u2019Anselmo, the Benedictine University in Rome, said in an email.",
      "In November, Hicks endorsed a special message from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops condemning the Trump administration\u2019s immigration raids, which have targeted Chicago in particular.",
      "In a statement then urging Catholics to share the message, Hicks said it \u201caffirms our solidarity with all our brothers and sisters as it expresses our concerns, opposition, and hopes with clarity and conviction. It is grounded in the church\u2019s enduring commitment to the Catholic social teaching of human dignity and a call for meaningful immigration reform.\u201d",
      "Though they both hail from Chicago, Hicks only met the future pope in 2024, when then-Cardinal Prevost visited one of Hicks\u2019 parishes and took part in a question and answer conversation for the public.",
      "Hicks, who sat in the front pew, said he learned that day what sort of future pope Leo would be and said he liked what he saw both in his public remarks and then in their private conversation. \u201cFive minutes turned into 10 minutes and the 10 minutes turned into 15 and the 15 turned into 20,\u201d Hicks told local Chicago WGN-TV news after Leo\u2019s May election.",
      "He said he recognized their shared backgrounds and priorities to build bridges. \u201cWe grew up literally in the same radius, in the same neighborhood together. We played in the same parks, went swimming in the same pools, like the same pizza places.\u201d",
      "Hicks served as a parish priest in Chicago and dean of training at Mundelein Seminary before Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich made him vicar general of the archdiocese in 2015. Three years later, Hicks was made an auxiliary bishop, and in 2020 Pope Francis named him bishop of Joliet, serving around 520,000 Catholics in seven counties.",

      "Dolan has ties to the current Republican administration. As archbishop of New York, Dolan hosted the annual Al Smith white-tie dinner that raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities. It has traditionally offered candidates from both parties the chance to trade lighthearted barbs ahead of Election Day, though in 2024 only Donald Trump participated since Democratic nominee Kamala Harris declined the invitation.",
      "Trump, who has long-standing connections to his native New York City, later had the cardinal pray at his inauguration and appointed Dolan to his new Religious Liberty Commission.",
      "Dolan was Trump\u2019s pick to succeed Pope Francis, though Dolan did criticize the president for sharing an AI-generated image of Trump, who is not a Catholic, dressed up as a pope before the May conclave that ultimately elected Leo.",
      "Dolan was named archbishop of New York by Pope Benedict XVI in February 2009  after serving as archbishop of Milwaukee. He was made cardinal in 2012 and headed the U.S. bishops conference from 2010-2013.",
      "In one of his biggest first tasks, Hicks will have to oversee the implementation of the abuse settlement fund that Dolan finalized, which is to be paid for by reducing the archdiocesan budget and selling off assets. The aim is to cover settlements for most, if not all of the roughly 1,300 outstanding abuse claims against the archdiocese.",
      "Hicks is no stranger to managing the fallout of the abuse scandal, after the Joliet diocese under his predecessors and the rest of the Illinois church came under scathing criticism by the state\u2019s attorney general in 2023.",
      "A five-year investigation found that 451 Catholic clergy abused 1,997 children in Illinois between 1950 and 2019. Hicks had been appointed to lead the Joliet church in 2020. The attorney general\u2019s report was generally positive in recognizing the diocese\u2019s current child protection policies, but documented several cases where previous Joliet bishops moved known abusers around, disparaged victims and refused to accept responsibility for their role in enabling the abuse.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court on Thursday formally removed the country\u2019s impeached police chief for deploying hundreds of officers to support ousted former President Yoon Suk Yeol's brief imposition of martial law in December 2024.",
      "The court said Cho Ji-ho \u201cactively disrupted\u201d legislative activities by sending police forces to the National Assembly and trying to block lawmakers from reaching the main chamber to vote to lift Yoon\u2019s decree.",
      "Cho also infringed upon the independence of the National Election Commission, the court said, by dispatching police to help the military\u2019s seizure of two NEC offices. Yoon said the actions were intended to investigate unsubstantiated claims of election fraud.",
      "Cho, who was impeached by lawmakers and arrested a week after Yoon\u2019s power grab, is the first commissioner general of the National Police Agency to be removed by the Constitutional Court. He was granted bail in January after a Seoul criminal court cited his need for cancer treatment and faces a separate criminal trial on charges of assisting a rebellion.",
      "Yoon imposed martial law on Dec. 3, 2024, describing the action as necessary to suppress an \u201canti-state\u201d liberal opposition controlling the legislature. Hours later a quorum of lawmakers managed to break through the military and police blockade and unanimously voted to revoke the order.",
      "Lawmakers later in December voted to impeach Yoon, suspending his powers and placing his fate with the Constitutional Court, which formally removed him from office in April. He was rearrested in July and faces a slew of serious charges including rebellion, which is punishable by life imprisonment or the death penalty.",
      "In its ruling on Cho\u2019s impeachment motion, the Constitutional Court said he cannot remain as the national police chief when he carried out Yoon\u2019s orders despite being clearly aware they were \u201cunconstitutional, unlawful.\u201d",

      "After protests by lawmakers and civilians at the National Assembly, police briefly allowed lawmakers and legislative staff to enter before sealing the grounds for more than two hours later that night after the military\u2019s martial law command announced the suspension of political activities.

      "PRISTINA, Kosovo -- A lion and bear rescued from captivity in northern Albania arrived in animal sanctuaries in Germany in early December after authorities in Tirana discovered they were being illegally kept as pets on a private estate.",
      "Erion, a 3-year-old lion, and Flora, a 2-year-old bear, are now both starting new lives.",
      "\u201cWe are very happy that the authorities confiscated the animals and that we now have the chance to bring them to Germany, where they can start over and live in species-appropriate conditions,\u201d said Magdalena Scherk-Trettin, a senior project manager responsible for rescues at the international animal welfare organization FOUR PAWS.",
      "A team from FOUR PAWS carried out the rescue after Albania\u2019s National Forestry Agency located the lion based on videos posted on TikTok by its owner.",
      "Neither authorities nor the organization have named the person who was keeping them as pets.",
      "Veterinarians administered anesthesia before the animals were loaded into crates for their long trip to new homes. On Dec. 13, they ended a 70-hour journey through several European countries, with Erion now housed in a wild animal sanctuary in southeast Germany and Flora in a bear sanctuary in the north of the country, FOUR PAWS said.",
      "The organization said both animals had been in poor condition.",
      "\u201cAn initial visual check determined that Flora is malnourished and has dental issues, so her recovery plan is already underway,\u201d the organization said.",
      "And when Erion was rescued, his mane had fallen out, for reasons that the veterinarians have not yet been able to determine, it said.",
      "Despite the challenging journey, the rescue was worth it, said Scherk-Trettin. \u201cWe are delighted to see these animals begin their new lives.\u201d",
      "Illegal wildlife trade remains a systemic problem in Albania and across the region, where bears in particular, as well as exotic animals, are kept in cages at restaurants or on private properties with little or no expert care.",

      "Weak legislation, legal loopholes and poor enforcement have contributed to the widespread private captivity and trade of wild animals in Albania, according to FOUR PAWS, which estimates that more than 60 big cats are still being kept in poor conditions in Albania.",
      "Albanian law allows for individuals or organizations to keep specimens of wild animals if they were born in captivity \u2013 for example in a zoo or a specialized facility. Non-native species born outside of Albania can also be kept if documents can be provided proving they were acquired from specialized breeding and trade centers.",
      "Sajmir Shehu, a project manager at Four Paws, said the law lacks a stringent framework based on which organizations like his could prevent wild animals being kept in captivity.",
      "The law also allows for animals to be confiscated if welfare or veterinary standards are not met, but impose no sanctions on the owners of exotic pets.",

      "Belgium was always at the heart of the European Union",
      "BRUSSELS -- For decades, Belgium has been at the beating heart of the European Union. The headquarters of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s main institutions and NATO are based there. EU leaders meet in the capital Brussels at least four times a year.",
      "But at Thursday\u2019s EU summit of presidents and government leaders, Belgium and its prime minister were at the heart of political tensions that could send ripples across the world\u2019s biggest trading bloc for years to come.",
      "The tensions arise from a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine\u2019s military and economic needs for the next two years. Most of that money is blocked at Euroclear, a Brussels-based financial clearinghouse.",
      "Belgium fears that Russia will strike back; in the courts or perhaps by other means.",
      "Prime Minister Bart De Wever \u2014 whose political ambition before taking office in February was to break up Belgium, gut its state structures and grant more autonomy to his northern Flanders region \u2014 wants Europe to unite around his concerns.",
      "The reparations loan plan, De Wever told Belgian lawmakers on Thursday, \u201cdrastically increases the risk of Russian retaliation. It\u2019s not acceptable that this happens to Belgium alone. If we jump, we jump together.\u201d",
      "The money blocked at Euroclear \u2014 193 billion euros ($226 billion) as of September \u2014 equals almost a third of the kingdom\u2019s gross domestic product. Belgium is mired in debt, among the worst financial performers in the EU.",
      "For months, De Wever struggled to chaperone his five-party coalition into agreeing on a budget. Those torturous negotiations only ended recently, making it tricky for him to agree on a loan to Ukraine that might hurt Belgium\u2019s finances.",
      "As the \u201creparations loan\u201d plan was being devised, his government regularly highlighted its vulnerability to retaliation.",
      "After EU leaders last debated the assets in October, Belgian Defense Minister Theo Francken said that a series of drone incidents at Belgium's airports and military bases appeared to be \u201ca spying operation\u201d aimed at \u201cdestabilizing\u201d people. The culprits were never identified.",

      "With Belgium standing firm, the question for its EU partners is whether to simply forge ahead without De Wever\u2019s consent. Ukraine needs the money early next year, and even Belgium agrees that the EU must find the funds soon.",
      "At least nine countries would have to object to prevent the loans and no blocking minority has yet emerged.",
      "But running roughshod over Belgium, particularly over a founding EU member country with much at stake, could undermine EU decision-making. Majorities would surely be harder to form in the future and other countries might be more inclined to use their vetoes.",

      "The question for De Wever is whether the legal and financial costs Belgium could suffer would outweigh the costs of undermining his country\u2019s credibility with his European partners, and with Ukraine.",
      "Whatever path is taken, summit chairman EU Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa has vowed to keep leaders negotiating until a funding deal is clinched, even if it takes days. It seems within De Wever\u2019s power to achieve that before he turns 55 on Sunday.",

      "The United States has announced it will resume nuclear testing if other countries do the same",
      "VIENNA -- In the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion earlier this year that the U.S. would resume nuclear testing, a U.S. government representative defended the stance at a global nuclear arms control meeting and pointed to nuclear provocations from Russia, China and North Korea.",
      "U.S. Charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires to the International Organizations in Vienna Howard Solomon made the previously unpublished comments, which were obtained by The Associated Press, at the Preparatory Commission of the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization on Nov. 10.",
      "\u201cAs President Trump indicated, the United States will begin testing activities on an equal basis with other nuclear-armed states. This process will begin immediately and proceed in a manner fully consistent with our commitment to transparency and national security,\" Solomon said.",
      "Solomon provided further explanation by noting, \u201cFor any who question this decision, context is important. Since 2019, including in this forum, the United States has raised concerns that Russia and China have not adhered to the zero-yield nuclear test moratorium,\u201d he said, adding that the concerns \u201cremain valid.\u201d",
      "Solomon's comment referred to so-called supercritical nuclear test explosions banned under the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, known as CTBT, where fissile material is compressed to start a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction that creates an explosion.",
      "The explosive tests produce an amount of energy released, referred to as nuclear yield, which defines a weapon\u2019s destructive power. The treaty bans any nuclear explosion with a yield, even a very small one, following a zero-yield standard.",
      "\"Our concerns with Russia and China are in addition to the activities of North Korea, which has conducted six nuclear explosive tests this century,\u201d Solomon said.",
      "The global monitoring network established alongside the treaty in 1996 to register nuclear tests worldwide has detected all of North Korea\u2019s six nuclear tests this century. Those were tests with larger yields.",
      "However, the monitoring network is unable to detect very low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground in metal chambers, experts say.",
      "The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether Solomon was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests.",
      "China and Russia, which have signed but not ratified the treaty, say they adhere to a nuclear testing moratorium.",
      "But since 2019, the U.S. State Department has publicly expressed concerns about China and Russia not adhering to their zero-yield testing moratoria. Annual reports on compliance with arms control agreements to the U.S. Congress cite possible activities at the Lop Nur nuclear testing site in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China and Russia\u2019s Novaya Zemlya site, a remote Arctic archipelago.",
      "In an interview for \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Nov. 2 on CBS News, Trump said, \u201cRussia\u2019s testing, and China\u2019s testing, but they don\u2019t talk about it. You know, we\u2019re a open society. We\u2019re different. We talk about it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t go and tell you about it,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cYou know, as powerful as they are, this is a big world. You don\u2019t necessarily know where they\u2019re testing. They \u2014 they test way under \u2014 underground where people don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s happening with the test.\u201d",
      "A White House official, asked for comment on whether Trump was referring to low-yield supercritical nuclear tests conducted underground, said the president had directed tests be done \u201con an equal basis\u201d to other countries. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record about the testing plans.",
      "Other countries have accelerated their testing programs and Trump wants to act accordingly, the official said without providing further details.",
      "Solomon\u2019s comments in Vienna came in response to Russia\u2019s Permanent Representative to the International Organizations, Mikhail Ulyanov, at a closed-door meeting of the Preparatory Commission of the CTBTO, an international body based in Vienna that monitors compliance with the nuclear test ban.",
      "\u201cThe resumption of nuclear testing could cause significant damage to the nuclear non-proliferation regime and international security,\u201d Ulyanov said.",
      "\u201cWe consider it fundamentally important that the U.S. side provide a clear and detailed explanation of its position on the resumption of nuclear testing,\u201d he added. \u201cWe expect the U.S. to respond appropriately and without further delay.\u201d",

      "The weapons referred to by Solomon generally have a lower explosive power than strategic nuclear weapons and are designed for use on the battlefield. They can still cause immense destruction.",
      "Despite being physically smaller, experts consider nonstrategic nuclear weapons dangerous because the threshold for use is considered lower. The weapons are not covered by arms control treaties, making development easier for Russia and other states without oversight or limits.",
      "The Nuclear Notebook, a renowned annual report published by the Federation of American Scientists in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, highlighted this point in this year\u2019s edition.",
      "\u201cOf particular concern is the role that nonstrategic nuclear weapons play because it may be this category of nuclear weapon that would be used first in a potential military escalation with NATO,\" the report said.",
      "Russia has between 1,000 and 2,000 nonstrategic nuclear warheads as of the latest unclassified assessment in 2023, according to the U.S. State Department, far more than the approximately 200 such weapons the U.S. maintains.",
      "By contrast, strategic nuclear weapons are even more powerful and are designed to be used deep inside an enemy\u2019s territory, far away from the actual battlefield where friendly forces may be located and risk being killed.",
      "The U.S. and Russia have a comparable total number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons, with 1,718 for Moscow and 1,770 for Washington, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.",
      "These weapons are capped by New START, formally known as the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms. It was signed by the Obama administration in 2010 and took effect in February 2011 as a 10-year agreement.",

      "The Associated Press has documented 145 incidents in what Western officials say is a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022",
      "In November, a train carrying almost 500 people came to a sudden halt in eastern Poland. A broken overhead line had smashed several windows, and the track ahead was damaged. Elsewhere on the line, explosives detonated under a passing freight train.",
      "No one was hurt in either case and the damage was limited, but Poland, which blamed the attack on Russia\u2019s intelligence services, responded forcefully: It deployed 10,000 troops to protect critical infrastructure.",
      "The sabotage in Poland is one of 145 incidents in an Associated Press database that Western officials say are part of a campaign of disruption across Europe masterminded by Russia. Officials say the campaign \u2014 waged since President Vladimir Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 \u2014 aims to deprive Kyiv of support, create divisions among Europeans and identify the continent's security weak spots.",
      "So far in this hybrid war, most known acts of sabotage have resulted in minimal damage \u2014 nothing compared to the tens of thousands of lives lost and cities decimated across Ukraine.",
      "But officials say each act \u2014 from vandalism of monuments to cyberattacks to warehouse fires \u2014 sucks up valuable security resources. The head of one large European intelligence service said investigations into Russian interference now swallow up as much of the agency\u2019s time as terrorism.",
      "While the campaign places a heavy burden on European security services, it costs Russia next to nothing, officials say. That\u2019s because Moscow is carrying out cross-border operations that require European countries to cooperate extensively on investigations \u2014 while often using foreigners with criminal backgrounds as cheap proxies for Russian intelligence operatives. That means Moscow notches up a win just by tying up resources \u2014 even when plots aren\u2019t successful.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a 24/7 operation between all the services to stop it,\u201d said a senior European intelligence official, who like the head of the European intelligence service and other officials who spoke to AP insisted on anonymity to discuss sensitive security matters.",
      "Over the course of the year, AP spoke to more than 40 European and NATO officials from 13 countries to document the scope of this hybrid war, including incidents on its map only when linked by Western officials to Russia, its proxies or its ally Belarus.",
      "Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told AP that Russia doesn't have \u201cany connection\u201d with the campaign.",
      "AP\u2019s database shows a spike in arson and explosives plots from one in 2023 to 26 in 2024. Six have been documented so far in 2025. Three vandalism cases were recorded last year, meanwhile, and one this year.",
      "The data is incomplete since not all incidents are made public, and it can take officials months to establish a link to Moscow. But the spike matches what officials have warned: The campaign is growing more dangerous.",
      "The countries most frequently targeted, according to the map, border Russia: Poland and Estonia. Several incidents have also occurred in Latvia, the U.K., Germany and France. All are major supporters of Ukraine.",
      "The European official, a senior Baltic intelligence official and another intelligence official said the campaign noticeably calmed in late 2024 and early this year. Their analysis showed Moscow likely paused the campaign to curry favor with U.S. President Donald Trump's new administration. It has since resumed at full pace.",
      "\u201cThey are back to business,\u201d the European official said.",
      "The man officials say was behind the attack on the Polish railway that carries supplies to Ukraine is Yevgeny Ivanov \u2014 a Ukrainian convicted of working with Russian military intelligence to plot arson attacks at home improvement stores, a cafe and a drone factory in Ukraine, according to court documents.",
      "Ivanov, who left Poland after the attack there, worked for Yury Sizov, an officer from Russia's GRU military intelligence service, according to Ukraine\u2019s security service.",
      "Ivanov was convicted in absentia in Ukraine but managed to enter Poland because Ukraine did not inform Polish officials of his conviction, Polish Interior Minister Marcin Kierwi\u0144ski said. Ukraine\u2019s security service said it closely cooperates with allies.",

      "The Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don\u2019t always translate into lower mortgage rates. That\u2019s what happened in the fall of 2024 after the central bank cut its main rate for the first time in more than four years. Instead of falling, mortgage rates marched higher, eventually cresting above 7% in January this year. At that time, the 10-year Treasury yield was climbing toward 5%.",

Airline jets are already equipped with a version of an ADS-B. The Black Hawk helicopter involved in the deadly collision with a plane trying to land at Reagan National Airport also had such a system, but it was flying with it turned off because the military was concerned about observers being able to pinpoint its location during a training mission.",
      "In March, the Federal Aviation Administration required all military helicopters to turn on their locator systems at all times when flying through the crowded airspace around the nation's capital. The agency also took action to ensure that helicopters and planes would no longer share the same airspace by pausing takeoffs and landings anytime a helicopter is passing the airport.",
      "FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford promised Tuesday to maintain those safety measures to ensure flying around Washington doesn't get riskier even if the military bill becomes law. Bedford is scheduled to testify at a Senate committee Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The bill also requires a review of safety at airports across the country to ensure they don't face the same hazards that contributed to the crash at Reagan Airport. And the military and FAA will have to share safety data more freely.",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half the workers because they are worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision they plan to announce Wednesday will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Donald Trump. The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs for all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\u201cThis proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\u201d Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between \u2019Hell or the highway.' \u201d",
      "The unions say they are worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides over the past two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they are optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Shareholders of both railroads overwhelmingly support it.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",

Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

      "Japan has reported its exports climbed 6% in November from a year earlier as shipments to the United States rose for the first time since March",
      "BANGKOK -- Japan's exports climbed 6% in November from a year earlier, with shipments to the United States rising for the first time since March as uncertainties over tariffs abated following a trade deal with the Trump administration.",
      "The preliminary data released Wednesday showed Japan's total imports rose 1.3% last month over a year earlier, leaving a surplus of 322.2 billion yen (about $2.1 billion).",
      "Exports to the U.S. rose nearly 9% from the year before as shipments of cars, chemicals and cameras helped make up for declines in machinery and iron and steel. Imports of U.S. oil nearly tripled, along with sharp increases in imports of grain and other food products.",
      "Japan\u2019s deal on tariffs with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, setting the baseline import duty for most products at 15% instead of the earlier plan for a 25% tariff, helped boost passenger car shipments by 8% when measured by the number of vehicles. But the value of those cars, trucks and buses inched up only 1.5%, reflecting the reluctance of automakers to pass costs from higher tariffs onto consumers.",
      "Imports from the U.S. climbed more than 7%, though Japan still logged a trade surplus of 739.8 billion yen ($4.7 billion), up 11% from a year earlier.",
      "Japan's exports to the European Union surged about 20% last month from a year earlier, supported by growth in demand for machinery, vehicles and other manufactured goods.",

      "Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos have donated $5 million to David Flink, founder of the Neurodiversity Alliance",
      "NEW YORK -- Mega billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his wife, former news anchor Lauren S\u00e1nchez Bezos, are awarding $5 million to the founder of a neurodivergent student support network, a recognition that the lesser-known recipient credits to the students powering his fast-growing movement for more inclusive classrooms.",
      "\u201cI feel like there\u2019s a narrative sometimes that our little actions don\u2019t matter,\u201d Neurodiversity Alliance CEO David Flink said. \"That\u2019s just not true. And this proves it. Lots of little actions that happen every day in our work, collectively over time, reached the ears of folks like Lauren and Jeff.\u201d",
      "Flink is among this year's five winners of the Bezos Courage & Civility Award. Given most years since 2021, the grant celebrates barrier-breaking individuals who unify people behind bold solutions to often neglected challenges. The no-strings-attached prize money can be used however honorees want to pursue their charitable goals.",
      "The Neurodiversity Alliance began over 25 years ago as a peer-to-peer mentorship program for students with various learning and developmental differences such as autism, ADHD and dyslexia. The nonprofit now reaches more than 600 high schools and colleges, encouraging youth to build educational environments that serve classmates whose brains function differently from what is considered typical.",
      "The Bezoses, who tied the knot this summer in a lavish Venice ceremony that drew protests highlighting wealth inequality, did not release any explanation for their support of the cause. The Amazon founder's net worth sits around $240 billion, according to Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world.",
      "Bezos has previously shown an interest in early childhood education through his nonprofit network of tuition-free preschools inspired by the Montessori model.",
      "S\u00e1nchez Bezos grew up with undiagnosed dyslexia. She told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last year that her children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Fly Who Flew to Space,\" is for \"the 8-year-old me who was told I wasn't smart.\" She credited a college professor, who recruited her to the school newspaper despite her insistence that she could not spell, for encouraging her to get tested.",
      "The selection of Flink marks a departure from the award's previous higher profile recipients. Past honorees include CNN political commentator Van Jones, World Central Kitchen founder Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, actor-director Eva Longoria and country superstar Dolly Parton. The shift reflects a desire to get the money closer to the ground rather than let well-known figures distribute money to the nonprofits of their choice.",
      "The smaller scale approach differs from many of Bezos\u2019 ultra wealthy peers, according to an Indiana University professor emeritus in public affairs and philanthropic studies. Leslie Lenkowsky said that today\u2019s entrepreneur-philanthropists \u2014 Bill Gates, for example \u2014 tend to focus on systemic change in the realms of health or education.",
      "\u201cRather than trying to change the system, what they\u2019re trying to do is provide funding to individuals or communities to deal with important issues,\u201d Lenkowsky said of the Bezoses. \u201cIt really is a much older model of philanthropy.\u201d",
      "The award's size is also smaller this year. Five winners are equally splitting a $25 million pot whereas past awards have totaled as much as $100 million.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer 's attempt to shut down an aging oil pipeline running beneath a channel linking two of the Great Lakes, finding that only the federal government can regulate interstate pipeline safety.",
      "Whitmer, a Democrat, ordered regulators in 2020 to revoke an easement that allows Enbridge Inc. to operate a 4.5-mile (6.4) kilometer pipeline segment under the Straits of Mackinac, which link Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Whitmer made the move out of concern that the 72-year-old pipeline could rupture and cause a catastrophic spill.",
      "Enbridge filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block the revocation and the pipeline continues to operate. President Donald Trump's administration argued in filings  this year that Whitmer's order interferes with U.S. foreign energy policy and that only the federal government, not the states, can regulate pipeline safety. The pipeline segment, known as Line 5, moves crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario.",
      "U.S. District Judge Robert Jonker wrote in an opinion that revoking the easement would effectively shut down Line 5. He found that Congress expressly prohibited states from regulating interstate pipeline safety in the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992. He also noted that the United States and Canada agree that Michigan's attempt to shut down the pipeline interferes with their federal foreign policy positions and trade relations.",
      "\u201cAn oil spill in Michigan's Great Lakes would undoubtedly be an environmental catastrophe. And Michigan would undoubtedly be the recipient of almost all the environmental damage that would result,\u201d Jonker wrote. \u201cBut for better or worse, the national government has unequivocally decided to displace state power in this area and assume exclusive responsibility for interstate pipeline safety.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, whose office represented Whitmer's administration in the lawsuit.",
      "Enbridge issued a statement saying the line is safe and that Jonker's ruling protects both the United States and Canada from \u201csignificant energy disruptions.\u201d",

      "The Indianapolis Colts have cleared quarterback Anthony Richardson to start practicing but will continue to keep Philip Rivers as the starter",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson returned to practice Thursday, marking the first time in two months he\u2019s taken snaps.",
      "He\u2019s still not ready to challenge 44-year-old Philip Rivers for the starting job.",
      "Coach Shane Steichen said Richardson\u2019s fractured orbital bone has healed sufficiently enough for him to be cleared for practice but that he would not be activated before Monday night\u2019s crucial game against the San Francisco 49ers and it\u2019s still unclear whether Richardson will be activated before the end of this season.",
      "\u201cHe has some vision limitations in his eye, but we\u2019re going to get him back on the practice field, get him throwing, doing some scout team,\u201d Steichen said. \u201cSo it\u2019s something that he\u2019s going to have to manage.\u201d",
      "Steichen said earlier this week that the Colts didn't sign Rivers to sit on the bench.",
      "Richardson has been on injured reserve since mid-October when he was injured in a freak locker room accident while stretching with a band as part of his pregame warmup routine. The Colts (8-6) now have 21 days to activate Richardson or to shut him down for the rest of the season.",
      "The Colts took Richardson with the No. 4 pick in the 2023 draft because of his tantalizing size, arm strength and mobility.",
      "But injuries have limited Richardson to just 15 starts and 17 total appearances out of 48 possible games. He made only four starts as a rookie before needing season-ending surgery on his throwing shoulder. He missed six games in 2024 with back and hip injuries and dislocated his pinkie during a preseason game this year before losing the quarterback battle to Daniel Jones.",
      "Richardson hasn't just struggled to stay on the field.",
      "He's also had trouble with accuracy. His completion percentage, 47.7%, in 2024 was the lowest of any starter in the NFL. And in three seasons, he's compiled an 8-7 record, a completion percentage of 50.6% with 11 touchdown passes and 13 interceptions. So Richardson is eager for a fresh start \u2014 even if it doesn't come till next season.",
      "\u201cI feel normal, able to see, able to drive, walk around, not bump into anything so I feel normal,\u201d said Richardson, who plans to continue wearing a visor underneath his face mask. \u201cSitting at home, it's not fun. It's really boring not being in the building as much when it first happened, not being around my teammates, not being able to go to the stadium and all that was really boring. But I thank God for being able to go out there and practice.\u201d",

      "Rivers joined Indy's practice squad last Tuesday and five days later was taking his first snaps in an NFL game in nearly five years. He nearly led the Colts to a come-from-behind victory at Seattle but the Seahawks kicked a late field goal to hand Indy its fourth consecutive loss, 18-16.",
      "Rivers said Thursday he feels much more comfortable after having a full week to prepare for the 49ers (10-4).",
      "\u201cReally trying to dive into San Francisco and take advantage of the extra day, get into a normal game week,\u201d the Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist said. \u201cLast week was a normal game week but not really because it was all ramped up, pretty fast. This has felt like more of a normal game week where we're able to get started on Monday and Tuesday, so it's felt somewhat routine from a standpoint of the daily operation.\u201d",
      "Indy needs Rivers to play well the last three weeks as it tries to end a four-year playoff drought. They face three strong defenses and three teams fighting to make the playoffs \u2014 San Francisco, two-time defending AFC South champion Houston (9-5) and AFC South-leading Jacksonville (10-4).",

      "The algorithm has been a central issue in the security debate over TikTok. China previously maintained the algorithm must remain under Chinese control by law. But the U.S. regulation passed with bipartisan support said any divestment of TikTok must mean the platform cuts ties \u2014 specifically the algorithm \u2014 with ByteDance.",
      "The deal marks the end of years of uncertainty about the fate of the popular video-sharing platform in the United States. After wide bipartisan majorities in Congress passed \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed \u2014 a law that would ban TikTok in the U.S. if it did not find a new owner in the place of China\u2019s ByteDance, the platform was set to go dark on the law\u2019s January 2025 deadline. For a several hours, it did. But on his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to keep it running while his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "Three more executive orders followed, as Trump, without a clear legal basis, continued to extend the deadline for a TikTok deal. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement. The third came in June, then another in September, which Trump said would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States in a way that meets national security concerns.",

      "NEW YORK -- The last major meteor shower of the year, known as the Ursids, peaks soon, bringing glowing streaks to nighttime and early morning skies. Compared to other meteor showers, it's more subdued, but experts say it's still worth a glimpse.",
      "Meteor showers happen when space rocks hit Earth's atmosphere at extremely high speeds and burn up, gaining fiery tails \u2014 the end of a \u201cshooting star.\u201d Random meteors are visible from Earth on any given clear night, but more predictable meteor showers happen yearly when Earth passes through streams of cosmic leftovers from comets or asteroids.",
      "The Ursids peak Sunday night into Monday morning and will be visible until Dec. 26 from the Northern Hemisphere. Skygazers usually see five to 10 meteors per hour during the height and there's a possibility for outbursts of up to 25 meteors per hour, according to the American Meteor Society.",
      "How active a shower will appear from Earth depends on the amount of debris and the moon's brightness, which can blot out glowing meteors. The Ursids feature less space debris than other showers like the Geminids, but the narrow crescent moon won't be much of an obstacle when they peak.",
      "No special equipment is needed to view a meteor shower. To see the Ursids, which hail from a comet called 8P/Tuttle, bundle up and get away from city lights.",

      "They stress that no one has found any signs of life at Titan, the solar system\u2019s second largest moon spanning 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers) and brimming with lakes of liquid methane on its frosty surface.",
      "But with the latest findings suggesting a slushy, near-melting environment, \u201cthere is strong justification for continued optimism regarding the potential for extraterrestrial life,\u201d said the University of Washington\u2019s Baptiste Journaux, who took part in the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "As to what form of life that might be, possibly strictly microscopic, \u201cnature has repeatedly demonstrated far greater creativity than the most imaginative scientists,\" he said in an email.",
      "JPL\u2019s Flavio Petricca, the lead author, said Titan\u2019s ocean may have frozen in the past and is currently melting, or its hydrosphere might be evolving toward complete freezing.",
      "Computer models suggest these layers of ice, slush and water extend to a depth of more than 340 miles (550 kilometers). The outer ice shell is thought to be about 100 miles (170 kilometers) deep, covering layers of slush and pools of water that could go down another 250 miles (400 kilometers). This water could be as warm as 68 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius).",
      "Because Titan is tidally locked, the same side of the moon faces Saturn all the time, just like our own moon and Earth. Saturn\u2019s gravitational pull is so intense that it deforms the moon\u2019s surface, creating bulges as high as 30 feet (10 meters) when the two bodies are closest.",
      "Through improved data processing, Petricca and his team managed to measure the timing between the peak gravitational tug and the rising of Titan\u2019s surface. If the moon held a wet ocean, the effect would be immediate, Petricca said, but a 15-hour gap was detected, indicating an interior of slushy ice with pockets of liquid water. Computer modeling of Titan\u2019s orientation in space supported their theory.",
      "Sapienza University of Rome\u2019s Luciano Iess, whose previous studies using Cassini data indicated a hidden ocean at Titan, is not convinced by the latest findings.",

      "Fernando Moreno has been waiting for a kidney transplant for about two years",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Fernando Moreno has been on dialysis for about two years, enduring an \u201cunbearable\u201d wait for a new kidney to save his life. His limited world of social contacts has meant that his hopes have hinged on inching up the national waiting list for a transplant.",
      "That was until earlier this year, when the Philadelphia hospital where he receives treatment connected him with a promising pilot project that has paired him with \u201cangel advocates\u201d \u2014 Good Samaritan strangers scattered around the country who leverage their own social media contacts to share his story.",
      "So far, the Great Social Experiment, as it was named by its founder, Los Angeles filmmaker David Krissman, hasn't found the Vineland, New Jersey, truck driver a living kidney donor. But there are encouraging early signs the angel advocate approach is working, and there's no question it has given Moreno new optimism.",
      "\u201cThis process is great,\u201d said Moreno, 50, whose own father died of kidney failure at 65. \u201cI'm just hoping there will be somebody out there that\u2019s willing to take a chance.\u201d",
      "Moreno is part of a pilot program with 15 patients that began in May at three Pennsylvania hospitals. It's testing whether motivated, volunteer strangers can help improve the chances of finding a life-saving match for a new kidney \u2014 particularly for people with limited social networks.",
      "\u201cWe know how this has always been done, and we're trying to put that on steroids and really get them the help that they need,\u201d Krissman said. \u201cMost patients are too sick to do this on their own \u2014 many don't have the skills to do it on their own.\u201d",
      "The Gift of Life Donor Program, which serves as the organ procurement network for eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware, is supporting the pilot program with a grant of more than $100,000 from its foundation.",
      "So far, two of the five patients in the program through Temple University Hospital have found kidney donors, and one is preparing for surgery, according to Ryan Ihlenfeldt, the hospital\u2019s director of clinical transplant services. One of the five patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center in Harrisburg has also undergone a transplant.",
      "The approach Krissman has developed is something new, said Richard Hasz Jr., Gift of Life's chief executive, and may help identify the types of messages that attract and motivate potential live kidney donors.",
      "\u201cThis is the first of its kind that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d Hasz said. \u201cThat\u2019s why, I think, the foundation was so interested in doing it -- studying it and hopefully publishing it \u2014 so we can create that blueprint, if you will, for the future.\u201d",
      "Gift of Life agreed to fund a broader test and helped Krissman identify five patients each at Temple, UPMC-Harrisburg and Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.",
      "Hasz said the pilot program's approach combines social media outreach with Krissman\u2019s storytelling talents and aggressive efforts to mobilize the patients\u2019 own connections.",
      "\u201cWe know that patients who are waiting don\u2019t always have the energy or the resources to do this themselves,\u201d Hasz said.",
      "There have been other ways for patients to set up \u201c microsites \u201d where they can tell their stories and seek a donor match. But the pilot program currently underway in Pennsylvania aims to connect patients with a wide universe of potential donors and produce videos and other ways to spread their message.",
      "Krissman's bout with an illness about two decades ago inspired him to tackle the sticky challenge of increasing live kidney donations. He was debilitated for more than a year before medication helped him recover, explaining, \u201cIt gave me my life back. And I never forgot what it's like to be chronically sick.\u201d",
      "After producing a podcast on kidney transplantation, Krissman recruited four patients through Facebook who were waiting for kidneys. He was able to help two of them. A second effort, a pilot program with three patients in North Carolina that ended last year, helped match all three with living donors.",

They allow for surgery to be planned for a time that is optimal for the donor, the recipient and the transplant team. And, the foundation says, living donor kidneys, on average, last longer than kidneys from deceased donors.",
      "The National Kidney Foundation says living donors must be at least 18 years old, although some transplant centers set the minimum age at 21.

    "story": [
      "In an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, tiny corals born in a laboratory are slowly growing under the eye of conservationists",
      "BAYAHIBE, Dominican Republic -- Oxygen tank strapped to his back, Michael del Rosario moves his fins delicately as he glides along an underwater nursery just off the Dominican Republic coast, proudly showing off the \u201ccoral babies\u201d growing on metal structures that look like large spiders. The conservationist enthusiastically points a finger to trace around the largest corals, just starting to reveal their vibrant colors.",
      "Del Rosario helped plant these tiny animals in the nursery after they were conceived in an assisted reproduction laboratory run by the marine conservation organization Fundemar. In a process something like in vitro fertilization, coral egg and sperm are joined to form a new individual.",
      "It's a technique that's gaining momentum in the Caribbean to counter the drastic loss of corals due to climate change, which is killing them by heating up oceans and making it more difficult for those that survive to reproduce naturally.",
      "\u201cWe live on an island. We depend entirely on coral reefs, and seeing them all disappear is really depressing,\u201d del Rosario said once back on the surface, his words flowing like bubbles underwater. \u201cBut seeing our coral babies growing, alive, in the sea gives us hope, which is what we were losing.\u201d",
      "The state of corals around the Dominican Republic, as in the rest of the world, is not encouraging. Fundemar\u2019s latest monitoring last year found that 70% of the Dominican Republic\u2019s reefs have less than 5% coral coverage. Healthy colonies are so far apart that the probability of one coral\u2019s eggs meeting another\u2019s sperm during the spawning season is decreasing.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why assisted reproduction programs are so important now, because what used to be normal in coral reefs is probably no longer possible for many species,\u201d biologist Andreina Valdez, operations manager at Fundemar, said at the organization\u2019s new marine research center. \u201cSo that\u2019s where we come in to help a little bit.\u201d",
      "Though many people may think corals are plants, they are animals. They spawn once a year, a few days after the full moon and at dusk, when they release millions of eggs and sperm in a spectacle that turns the sea around them into a kind of Milky Way. Fundemar monitors spawning periods, collects eggs and sperm, performs assisted fertilization in the laboratory, and cares for the larvae until they are strong enough to be taken to the reef.",
      "In the laboratory, Ariel \u00c1lvarez examines one of the star-shaped pieces on which the corals are growing through a microscope. They're so tiny they can hardly be seen with the naked eye. \u00c1lvarez switches off the lights, turns on an ultraviolet light, and the coral\u2019s rounded, fractal shapes appear through a camera on the microscope projected onto a screen.",
      "One research center room holds dozens of fish tanks, each with hundreds of tiny corals awaiting return to the reef. Del Rosario said the lab produces more than 2.5 million coral embryos per year. Only 1% will survive in the ocean, yet that figure is better than the rate with natural fertilization on these degraded reefs now, he said.",
      "In the past, Fundemar and other conservation organizations focused on asexual reproduction. That meant cutting a small piece of healthy coral and transplanting it to another location so that a new one would grow. The method can produce corals faster than assisted fertilization.",
      "The problem, Andreina Valdez said, is that it clones the same individual, meaning all those coral share the same disease vulnerabilities. In contrast, assisted sexual reproduction creates genetically different individuals, reducing the chance that a single illness could strike them all down.",
      "Australia pioneered assisted coral fertilization. It's expanding in the Caribbean, with leading projects at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the Carmabi Foundation in Cura\u00e7ao, and it's being adopted in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Jamaica, Valdez said.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t conserve something if you don\u2019t have it. So (these programs) are helping to expand the population that\u2019s out there,\u201d said Mark Eakin, corresponding secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired chief of the Coral Reef Watch program of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "But the world must still tackle \u201cthe 800-pound gorilla of climate change,\u201d Eakin said, or a lot of the restoration work \u201cis just going to be wiped out.\u201d",
      "Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and coal produces greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere, driving up temperatures both on Earth\u2019s surface and in its seas. Oceans are warming at twice the rate of 20 years ago, according to UNESCO\u2019s most recent State of the Ocean Report last year.",
      "And that's devastating for corals. Rising heat causes them to feel sick and expel the algae that live in their tissue and provide them both their striking colors and their food. The process is known as bleaching because it exposes the coral's white skeleton. The corals may survive, but they are weakened and vulnerable to disease and death if temperatures don't drop.",

      "Corals also are home to more than 25% of marine life, making them crucial for the millions of people around the world who make a living from fishing.",

      "It's not yet dawn in Bayahibe when he climbs into a boat to fish with his father, who at 65 still goes to sea every week. The engine roars as they travel mile after mile until the coastline fades into the horizon. To catch tuna, dorado, or marlin, Luis B\u00e1ez sails up to 50 miles offshore.",

      "Del Rosario said there's still time to halt the decline of the reefs.",
      "\u201cMore needs to be done, of course ... but we are investing a lot of effort and time to preserve what we love so much,\" he said. \"And we trust and believe that many people around the world are doing the same.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- China is exploiting partnerships with U.S. researchers funded by the Department of Energy to provide the Chinese military with access to sensitive nuclear technology and other innovations with economic and national security applications, according to a congressional report published Wednesday.",
      "The authors of the report say the U.S. must do more to protect high-tech research and ensure that the results of taxpayer-funded work don't end up benefiting Beijing. They recommended several changes to better protect scientific research in the U.S., including new policies for the Department of Energy to use when deciding whether to fund work that involves Chinese partnerships.",
      "The investigation is part of a congressional push to raise a firewall blocking U.S. research from boosting China's military buildup when the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry that will shape the future global order.",
      "Investigators from the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and the House Committee on Education and the Workforce identified more than 4,300 academic papers published between June 2023 and June of this year that involved collaborations between DOE-funded scientists and Chinese researchers. About half of the papers involved Chinese researchers affiliated with China's military or industrial base.",
      "Particularly concerning, investigators found that federal funds went to research collaborations with Chinese state-owned laboratories and universities that work directly for China\u2019s military, including some listed in a Pentagon database of Chinese military companies with operations in the U.S. The report also detailed collaborations between U.S. researchers and groups blamed for cyberattacks as well as human rights abuses in China.",
      "The Energy Department routinely funds advanced research into nuclear energy and the development and disposal of nuclear weaponry, along with a long list of other high-tech fields like quantum computing, materials science and physics. It doles out hundreds of millions of dollars each year for research. The department oversees 17 national laboratories that have led the development in many technologies.",
      "The report followed a number of congressional investigations into federally funded research involving Chinese scientists and researchers. Last year, a report released by Republicans found that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade had allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology that could help strengthen its military. Another investigation this year revealed that the Pentagon in a recent two-year period funded hundreds of projects in collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense industry.",
      "The Energy Department has failed for decades to take steps to ensure the research it funds doesn't benefit China, the report's authors found. They made several recommendations to tighten the rules, including a new standardized approach to assessing the national security risks of research, as well as requirements that the department share information about research ties with China with other U.S. government agencies to make it easier to spot problems.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- California regulators are threatening to suspend Tesla's license to sell its electric cars in the state early next year unless the automaker tones down its marketing tactics for its self-driving features after a judge concluded the Elon Musk-led company has been misleading consumers about the technology's capabilities.",
      "The potential 30-day blackout of Tesla's California sales is the primary punishment being recommended to the state's Department of Motor Vehicles in a decision released late Tuesday. The ruling by Administrative Law Judge Juliet Cox determined that Tesla had for years engaged in deceptive marketing practices by using the terms \u201cAutopilot\u201d and \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d to promote the autonomous technology available in many of its cars.",
      "After presiding over five days of hearings held in Oakland, California in July, Cox also recommended suspending Tesla's license to manufacture cars at its plant in Fremont, California. But California regulators aren't going to impose that part of the judge's proposed penalty.",
      "Tesla will have a 90-day window to make changes that more clearly convey the limits of its self-driving technology to avoid having its California sales license suspended. After California regulators filed its action against Tesla in 2023, the Austin, Texas, company already made one significant change by putting in wording that made it clear its Full Self-Driving package still required supervision by a human driver while it's deployed.",
      "\u201cTesla can take simple steps to pause this decision and permanently resolve this issue \u2014 steps autonomous vehicle companies and other automakers have been able to achieve,\" said Steve Gordon, the director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles.",
      "Tesla didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday.",
      "The automaker has already been plagued by a global downturn in demand that began during a backlash to Musk's high-profile role overseeing cuts in the U.S. government budget overseeing the Department of Government that President Donald Trump created in his administration. Increased competition and an older lineup of vehicles also weighed on Tesla sales, although the company did revamp its Model Y, the world\u2019s bestselling vehicle, and unveil less-expensive versions of the Model Y and Model X.",

      "Although Musk left Washington after a falling out with Trump, the fallout has continued to weigh on Tesla's auto sales, which had decreased by 9% from 2024 through the first nine months of this year.",
      "Despite the slump and the threatened sales suspension in California, Tesla's stock price touched an all-time high $495.28 during Wednesday's early trading before backtracking later to fall below $470. Despite that reversal, Tesla's shares are still worth slightly more than they were before Musk's ill-fated stint in the Trump administration \u2014 a \u201csomewhat successful\u201d assignment he recently said he wouldn't take on again.",
      "The performance of Tesla's stock against the backdrop of eroding auto sales reflects the increasing emphasis that investors are placing on Musk's efforts to develop artificial intelligence technology to implant into humanoid robots and a fleet of self-driving Teslas that will operate as robotaxis across the U.S.",
      "Musk has been promising Tesla's self-driving technology would fulfill his robotaxi vision for years without delivering on the promise, but the company finally began testing the concept in Austin earlier this year, albeit with a human supervisor in the car to take over if something went awry. Just a few days ago, Musk disclosed Tesla had started tests of its robotaxis without a safety monitor in the vehicle.",
      "California regulators are far from the first critic to accuse Tesla of exaggerating the capabilities of its self-driving technology in a potentially dangerous manner. The company has steadfastly insisted that information contained in its vehicle's owner's manual on its website have made it clear that its self-driving technology still requires human supervision, even while releasing a 2020 video depicting one of its cars purportedly driving on its own. The video, cited as evidence against Tesla in the decision recommending a suspension of the company's California sales license, remained on its website for nearly four years.",
      "Tesla has been targeted in a variety of lawsuits alleging its mischaracterizations about self-driving technology have lulled humans into a false of security that have resulted in lethal accidents. The company has settled or prevailed in several cases, but earlier this year a Miami jury held Tesla partly responsible for a lethal crash in Florida that occurred while Autopilot was deployed and ordered the automaker to pay more than $240 million in damages.",

    "story": [
      "Myanmar\u2019s military leadership has vowed to crack down on cyberscam centers, starting with the notorious KK Park",
      "It looked like a turning point in the global fight against scams. Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, under growing international pressure, vowed to wipe out the industrial-scale cyberscam centers that have taken root in the country. They started by raiding and then bombing KK Park \u2014 a notorious compound that has become a symbol of impunity in the battle against one of the most lucrative criminal industries in the world.",
      "It\u2019s too early to say whether KK Park will be abandoned, repurposed or rebuilt over time. But even if KK Park were to close, it\u2019s just one of around 30 scam compounds along Myanmar\u2019s border with Thailand \u2014 one indication that the crackdown may not turn out to be as deep or long-lasting as Myanmar\u2019s military rulers would like it to appear.",
      "The Associated Press found that at least two scam compounds in the area continued to use Starlink to get online even after SpaceX announced it had cut off service. And there are other signs the scam industry is adapting fast: The physical damage to KK Park sent thousands of workers scattering to other scam companies in Myanmar and abroad, interviews with current and former scam center workers show. Telegram is popping with job ads for newly displaced workers. And work has continued uninterrupted at other scam centers in Myanmar, where people trafficked from around the world still wait to be rescued.",
      "\u201cEven if you destroy buildings, if you haven\u2019t arrested the heads of the transnational syndicates behind this, seized their wealth and put them in jail, it\u2019s not a real crackdown yet,\u201d said Jay Kritiya, the coordinator of the Civil Society Network for Human Trafficking Victim Assistance.",
      "Myanmar state media announced the raid on KK Park on Oct. 20, which was followed by a weekslong demolition campaign. In November, Myanmar\u2019s military rulers pledged to \u201ceradicate scam activities from their roots.\u201d State media broadcast images of wreckage and soldiers standing with dozens of seized Starlink terminals. They then went after Shwe Kokko, another notorious compound that\u2019s been in the crosshairs of U.S. authorities. SpaceX announced it cut off access to more than 2,500 Starlink units in Myanmar, where they have been widely used by scammers to get online. And Meta said this month it had taken down 2,000 Facebook accounts used by scammers in Myanmar.",
      "It looked as if growing American pressure on foreign scam centers through sanctions, prosecutions and a new, high-level Scam Center Strike Force, was having swift impact as Myanmar prepares for national elections, which have been widely criticized as a sham effort to legitimize the army\u2019s 2021 seizure of power.",
      "Myanmar has said the demolition at KK Park \u2014 and raids at additional scam sites \u2014 are meant to ensure that criminal activity never returns. This month the government created a high-level task force to enact what it calls a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy against scams. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar on Dec. 15 devoted five full pages to coverage of a press conference showcasing what it described as the government\u2019s aggressive efforts to stop fraud, and characterized cyberscams as the work of foreign criminal networks that have taken root in lawless borderlands controlled by insurgents.",
      "Government officials said that by Dec. 13, 413 buildings in KK Park had been \u201cdemolished\u201d and the remaining 222 would be cleared as well. Detailed visual analysis of the first wave of demolition, which the government says is complete, shows that 31 structures were flattened. At least 78 more were partially damaged, according to the Center for Information Resilience (CIR), a London-based nonprofit focused on exposing human rights violations.",
      "More than half the buildings were damaged by heavy machinery, which often left roofs, ceilings and layers between floors intact, said Guy Fusfus, an investigator at Myanmar Witness, a CIR project. \u201cThere may be an intention to reconstruct and reuse these buildings,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "New satellite imagery shows that most buildings in KK Park appeared wholly or partially intact on Dec. 4, even as demolition had spread to other sections of the compound. Once home to thousands of workers, many victims of human trafficking, the streets of KK Park appeared empty. Where all those people went \u2014 and what that portends for the future of a criminal industry the FBI says cost Americans more than $16 billion last year \u2014 remain open questions.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just breaking windows and moving on. You can\u2019t come in and restart operations here at the same scale as before,\u201d said Eric Heintz, a global analyst at the International Justice Mission, a Washington, D.C.-based NGO, who reviewed satellite images of the damage. \u201cBut we don\u2019t know if that activity is just going to be displaced to other locations.\u201d",
      "Myanmar\u2019s track record of lasting enforcement is poor. Raids in response to Chinese pressure earlier this year failed to contain the growth of scam compounds, according to C4ADS, a U.S.-based nonprofit that takes a data-driven approach to conflict analysis. Over 7,000 scam center workers were released as part of that purge, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, but the scams kept on running.",
      "C4ADS examined satellite imagery of 21 known scam compounds in Myawaddy Township and found that 14 of them \u2014 including KK Park \u2014 had shown construction or expansion since January. Some solar panels also appeared \u2014 a step toward energy independence that could blunt the impact of crackdowns from neighboring Thailand, which has occasionally cut off power.",
      "\u201cThis continued growth of scam compounds is emblematic of the junta\u2019s inability to rein in the industry within Myanmar,\u201d said Michael Di Girolamo, a C4ADS analyst focused on cybercrime.",
      "Analysts say that some of the same people who led the raid on KK Park have profited from scams over the years. KK Park, like most scam compounds along the Thai border, operates under the protection of the Karen Border Guard Force \u2014 also known as the Karen National Army \u2014 an armed militia made up of ethnic Karen people who live in eastern Myanmar that is affiliated with the Myanmar military, according to U.S. and European government sanctions notices.",
      "Jason Tower, a senior expert at the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said the action at KK Park was a way for Myanmar\u2019s military leadership to relieve pressure, primarily from the U.S. and China, and continue to host highly lucrative criminal activity. \u201cThere\u2019s no real political will to crack down,\u201d he said.",
      "A month after KK Park was raided, another scam center fell, far from the glare of government propaganda. On Nov. 21, forces of the Karen National Union, a rebel group opposed to Myanmar\u2019s military leadership, stormed a scam compound called Shunda Park in an area controlled by a pro-government militia.",
      "\u201cThis looks much more like a real crackdown on crime,\u201d Tower said.",
      "While Myanmar state television broadcast images of a steamroller crushing rows of scammers\u2019 computers, the Karen National Union gathered 604 mobile phones, bank cards, computers and other evidence from Shunda and handed them over to Thai authorities for investigation.",

      "Authorities are searching for a suspect in the killing of Nuno Loureiro, a prominent MIT physics professor",
      "Authorities are searching for a suspect in the killing of Nuno F.G. Loureiro, a prominent physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was shot at his home near Boston. Loureiro, a married 47-year-old from Portugal, was shot Monday night and died Tuesday at a local hospital.",
      "Authorities have not disclosed a possible motive, and no suspects were in custody as of Wednesday morning, the Norfolk District Attorney\u2019s Office said.",
      "The shooting in Brookline, Massachusetts, comes days after a deadly attack at another prestigious school in the region, Brown University, where police also haven't identified the suspect who killed two students and wounded nine others. The FBI said it knows of no connection between the two crimes.",
      "Loureiro joined MIT in 2016 and was named last year to lead the school\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center, one of its largest laboratories. The center has around 250 researchers working across seven buildings and focuses on advancing clean energy technology and other research.",
      "The professor grew up in Viseu in central Portugal, studied in Lisbon and earned a doctorate in London, according to the university. Before moving to MIT, he worked at a nuclear fusion research institute in Lisbon.",
      "Loureiro studied the behavior of plasma and worked to explain the physics behind astronomical phenomena such as solar flares. His research, according to his obituary on MIT\u2019s news site, \u201cinvolved the design of fusion devices that could harness the energy of fusing plasmas, bringing the dream of clean, near-limitless fusion power closer to reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not hyperbole to say MIT is where you go to find solutions to humanity\u2019s biggest problems,\u201d Loureiro told the school's news site when he became head of the plasma lab. \u201cFusion energy will change the course of human history.\u201d",

      "The Islamic State group and other militant organizations are experimenting with artificial intelligence as a tool to boost recruitment and refine their operations",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the rest of the world rushes to harness the power of artificial intelligence, militant groups also are experimenting with the technology, even if they aren't sure exactly what to do with it.",
      "For extremist organizations, AI could be a powerful tool for recruiting new members, churning out realistic deepfake images and refining their cyberattacks, national security experts and spy agencies have warned.",
      "Someone posting on a pro-Islamic State group website last month urged other IS supporters to make AI part of their operations. \u201cOne of the best things about AI is how easy it is to use,\u201d the user wrote in English.",
      "\u201cSome intelligence agencies worry that AI will contribute (to) recruiting,\u201d the user continued. \u201cSo make their nightmares into reality.\u201d",
      "IS, which had seized territory in Iraq and Syria years ago but is now a decentralized alliance of militant groups that share a violent ideology, realized years ago that social media could be a potent tool for recruitment and disinformation, so it's not surprising that the group is testing out AI, national security experts say.",
      "For loose-knit, poorly resourced extremist groups \u2014 or even an individual bad actor with a web connection \u2014 AI can be used to pump out propaganda or deepfakes at scale, widening their reach and expanding their influence.",
      "\u201cFor any adversary, AI really makes it much easier to do things,\u201d said John Laliberte, a former vulnerability researcher at the National Security Agency who is now CEO of cybersecurity firm ClearVector. \u201cWith AI, even a small group that doesn't have a lot of money is still able to make an impact.\u201d",
      "Militant groups began using AI as soon as programs like ChatGPT became widely accessible. In the years since, they have increasingly used generative AI programs to create realistic-looking photos and video.",
      "When strapped to social media algorithms, this fake content can help recruit new believers, confuse or frighten enemies and spread propaganda at a scale unimaginable just a few years ago.",
      "Such groups spread fake images two years ago of the Israel-Hamas war depicting bloodied, abandoned babies in bombed-out buildings. The images spurred outrage and polarization while obscuring the war's actual horrors. Violent groups in the Middle East used the photos to recruit new members, as did antisemitic hate groups in the U.S. and elsewhere.",
      "Something similar happened last year after an attack claimed by an IS affiliate killed nearly 140 people at a concert venue in Russia. In the days after the shooting, AI-crafted propaganda videos circulated widely on discussion boards and social media, seeking new recruits.",
      "IS also has created deepfake audio recordings of its own leaders reciting scripture and used AI to quickly translate messages into multiple languages, according to researchers at SITE Intelligence Group, a firm that tracks extremist activities and has investigated IS' evolving use of AI.",
      "Such groups lag behind China, Russia or Iran and still view the more sophisticated uses of AI as \u201caspirational,\u201d according to Marcus Fowler, a former CIA agent who is now CEO at Darktrace Federal, a cybersecurity firm that works with the federal government.",

      "More concerning is the possibility that militant groups may try to use AI to help produce biological or chemical weapons, making up for a lack of technical expertise. That risk was included in the Department of Homeland Security's updated Homeland Threat Assessment, released earlier this year.",

      "Members use social platforms to push vulnerable teens into harming themselves.",
      "In striking and chilling terms, several career Justice Department officials on Thursday offered dire warnings about the online extremist network \"764,\" whose young followers around the world use popular social media platforms to target, groom and push vulnerable teens into harming themselves and others.",
      "\"I don't think Stephen King is dark enough to come up with some of the stuff that these kids are coming up with,\" said Justin Sher, a trial attorney with the Justice Department's National Security Division.",
      "\"It is as serious a threat as you can imagine,\" Sher's Justice Department colleague James Donnelly said. \"[And] they're trying to metastasize the evil.\"",
      "Their comments came during a panel about 764 hosted by George Washington University's Program on Extremism. It was a rare public appearance for two career prosecutors who the panel's moderator described as \"the point people\" on 764 within the department's National Security Division.",
      "Sher and Donnelly both noted that 764 members are increasingly trying to push victims to take deadly actions, including suicide or school shootings and other mass-casualty attacks.",
      "As ABC News has previously reported, 764 members find vulnerable victims on popular online platforms, elicit private information and intimate sexual images from them, and then use that sensitive material to threaten and blackmail victims into mutilating themselves, harming others, or taking other violent action --- all while streaming it on social media so others can watch and then disseminate recordings of it.",
      "\"For them, content is currency,\" Sher said. \"So they are building their content inventory ... and putting it out there to build their status within these groups.\"",
      "While anyone can be targeted, 764 members often \"systematically target underage females,\" especially those already struggling with depression, eating disorders or other mental health issues, according to an FBI agent's description of 764 in charging documents from a recent case in Tennessee.",
      "\"[764] actors often groom their victims by first establishing a trusting or romantic relationship before eventually manipulating and coercing them,\" the agent wrote. \"Extremists control their victims through building immense fear,\" and they do it simply \"for the network's entertainment or threat actor's own sense of fame,\" the agent said.",
      "The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children says it received more than 2,000 reports of abuse tied to 764 or similar networks in the first nine months of this year -- double the number of reports it received last year.",
      "In the Tennessee case, during the summer of last year, 19-year-old Cayden Newberry of Johnson City and others associated with 764 allegedly forced a 13-year-old girl from Raritan, New Jersey -- hundreds of miles away -- to carve their initials into her leg and then send pictures and videos of it to them. The young victim later learned that many of them shared the content with the so-called \"boss\" of a 764-related group on Discord so they could be admitted into the group, charging documents allege.",
      "At one point, Newberry allegedly used DoorDash to have a cell phone purchased at Target and then delivered to the girl's home \"so they could exclusively and discreetly communicate,\" according to the charging documents.",
      "Newberry was first arrested last month and indicted last week on two counts related to child exploitation.",
      "During Thursday's panel, Sher explained that many members of 764 and similar networks have a particularly concerning goal -- which is why the Justice Department's National Security Division and FBI are now paying such close attention to 764.",

      "\"Their objective is ... to cause the downfall of society, cause the downfall of the U.S. government,\" Sher said of 764 and similar networks. \"They want a Darwinian society, they want one that is survival of the fittest.\"",
      "The FBI is investigating more than 350 people across the United States with suspected ties to 764 or similar networks. And the Justice Department has already publicly charged at least 37 such people in recent years, including Newberry.",
      "Their victims have been as young as nine years old, according to authorities.",
      "Career Justice Department officials on Thursday's panel agreed that current U.S. law can make it harder to prosecute 764-related cases.",
      "\"Coercing a minor to engage in self-harm or to harm another is not necessarily criminalized in an easy way,\" said Steve Grocki, the chief of the Justice Department's Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section. \"It is challenging to some extent.\"",
      "But he said federal prosecutors try to \"be creative\" and find ways to use existing laws, even as some in Congress are trying to pass new laws that would address the specific conduct of online extremist networks like 764.",
      "An assistant U.S. attorney with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago, Kavitha Babu, also noted that federal prosecutors are \"often\" hesitant to prosecute minors, which presents a challenge to taking on 764 since so many minors are being victimized by fellow minors. But she said that she and other prosecutors are now \"taking a harder look\" at whether federal charges might be warranted in cases involving minors.",
      "Thursday's panel was held just hours before a 19-year-old man from San Antonio, Texas, admitted in federal court that, through his actions with 764, he took part in a criminal enterprise and racketeering conspiracy.",
      "According to documents filed in court, Alexis Aldair Chavez began consuming violent 764-related content on the online platforms Discord and Telegram in 2022, and he eventually \"earned the right\" to speak with other 764 members \"by killing his cat, recording the killing, and posting it [online] for others to see.\"",
      "Over the next nearly two years, he allegedly groomed several young girls around the world for extortion and self-mutilation. He allegedly pushed one young girl to light her arm on fire during a recorded video call and forced another young girl to create an 18-minute video that showed her harming herself in horrific and sexually-explicit ways, including with a dead rat that had been in a jar, suspended in solution.",
      "The video showed her \"crying out in pain as the solution on the dead rat burned\" her, according to court documents.",
      "By June 2024, Chavez was allegedly acting as an administrator for various 764 subsidiaries online. He was arrested in October 2024, and pleaded guilty late Thursday to one count of participating in a racketeering conspiracy, one count of distributing child pornography, and one count of possessing child pornography.",
      "764 was first launched by a 15-year-old in Texas, Bradley Cadenhead, who named it after the first three digits of his ZIP code. Since then, 764 has spread around the world, growing into more of an ideology than a singular group, experts say. And other groups, inspired by 764, have formed with different names but identical tactics and goals.",
      "\"764 is sort of the big brand name. And if content is in fact their currency, 764 has the biggest war chest,\" Sher said.",

      "In a dusty corral ringed by posts as thick as telephone polls, the orphan elephants of the Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya are fed their lunch: goat's milk, which wildlife caretakers say is a suitable substitute to elephant's milk",
      "RETETI ELEPHANT SANCTUARY, Kenya -- We stood at the edge of a dusty corral baked by the equatorial sun and ringed by chest-high posts as thick as telephone poles. On some posts, workers had perched plastic jugs of goat's milk, each holding a couple of liters and equipped with red nipples the size of a man\u2019s finger.",
      "Across the corral, a young elephant ambled into view, head bobbing, trunk curling, ears flapping, trundling along as fast as its tree-trunk legs could carry it. Another followed, then a steady stream, bumping and jostling, kicking up orange dust \u2014 a joyful stampede of 2,000-pound toddlers.",
      "It was feeding time for the orphan elephants of Reteti Elephant Sanctuary in Kenya.",
      "The keepers tipped the jugs into the elephants\u2019 hungry mouths while sing-chanting a traditional lyric that praises them for being good eaters. Each jug was drained in seconds. Some elephants managed to wrap their trunk around a jug and gulp down lunch on their own.",
      "We were about halfway through a two-week trip through Kenya organized by a fledgling nonprofit that contributes a share of its revenue to local development in the country. The trek combined a traditional safari with chances to meet the Kenyan people who are working to preserve the wildlife. And, unexpected and most compelling, we saw how tourism and wildlife conservation are improving the lives of Indigenous people.",
      "Reteti, run by the Samburu tribe, rescues young elephants that villagers notice have become separated from their families. A threshold problem was how to feed the orphans; manufactured formula was costly and nutritionally unsuitable. The answer was in the omnipresent goat herds in rural Kenya. Goat's milk, it turned out, was a suitable substitute for elephant's milk, wildlife caretakers at Reteti said.",
      "More than 1,200 Samburu women sell nearly 700 liters (185 gallons) of milk from their goat herds to Reteti each day. Along with enabling them to buy better clothing and food, that gives them some financial independence from their husbands \u2014 a break from tradition.",
      "Reteti also employs about 100 Samburu people and says it is the only elephant sanctuary in Africa entirely run by Indigenous people.",
      "\u201cWe can say that elephants are the keystone of the entire economy,\u201d said Dorothy Lowakutuk, a Samburu woman and elephant keeper who has become a spokesperson for the sanctuary.",
      "Uplift Travel, which organized the safari, was founded with the intent to provide support to communities in Kenya, particularly with projects that help women and girls. Kim Schneider, a Michigan-based travel writer, created the group with a partner in philanthropy, Tanja Wittrock, after they discovered how a little money could have a huge impact on quality of life.",
      "\u201cI set out with a heart for travel and a heart for helping people, and this has married the two,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSafari\u201d is Swahili for \u201cjourney,\u201d and almost all of the overland drives qualified. A trip of 100 miles (160 kilometers) could take most of the day, traversing two-lane highways clogged with slow-moving semitrailers or backroads whose gullies and piano-size potholes tested the brawny, seven-passenger Toyota Land Cruisers at every turn.",
      "In the wildlife areas, we rarely left the vehicles, save for photos at the equator and a brief stop to tiptoe across Kenya\u2019s southern border into Tanzania.",

An international team of scientists is working to perpetuate the species using sperm from the last male northern white, Sudan, who died in 2014, and a southern white rhino as surrogate mom.",
      "The conservancy has not lost a rhino to poachers since 2017. But much of the danger to Kenya\u2019s wildlife today arises from conflicts between the animals and the people who live on the land. Elephants trample crops, lions and leopards prey on livestock.

      "Most of our accommodations in Kenya\u2019s wildlife reserves were run by Serena Hotels, an operator of luxury resorts and hotels in Africa and South Asia. Rooms or cabins had safari-themed touches. At a couple stops, cabins were built to look like tents, with canvas roofs, solid floors, electricity and hot showers. Breakfasts and dinners were buffet-style.",

      "Frank Athen Walls, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Walls was convicted of two counts of murder, two counts of kidnapping, burglary and theft and sentenced to death in 1988.

      "It would be Florida's 19th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending a state record for total executions in a single year.",
      "According to court records, Walls broke into the Florida Panhandle mobile home of Eglin Air Force Base airman Edward Alger and his girlfriend, Ann Peterson, in July 1987. Walls tied the couple up, but Alger managed to break free and attack Walls. Walls cut Alger\u2019s throat and them shot him in the head when the airman continued to fight. Walls then went to attack Peterson and shot her as she struggled.",
      "Walls was arrested the day after the bodies were found when his roommate tipped off police about Walls\u2019 odd behavior. During a search of the home, investigators reported finding items from the crime scene, and Walls later admitted to the killings.",

      "Prosecutors rested their case against Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on Wednesday after three days of testimony. Dugan's defense attorneys said they planned to call four witnesses starting Thursday morning. It wasn\u2019t clear whether Dugan would take the stand. Closing arguments could begin as early as Thursday afternoon.",

      "Members of the task force testified that they learned Flores-Ruiz was in the country illegally after he was arrested in Milwaukee on state battery charges. He was scheduled to appear for a hearing in front of Dugan on April 18. Six agents and officers staked out Dugan's courtroom that morning, ready to arrest him when he emerged from the hearing.",

      "Cervera, for her part, testified that she was uncomfortable backing up Dugan during her confrontations with the arrest team. She said she was shocked when she heard Dugan led Flores-Ruiz out a private door, adding that judges shouldn't help defendants evade arrest. Cervera also testified that Dugan told her three days after the incident that Dugan was \u201cin the doghouse\u201d with the chief judge, Carl Ashley, because she \u201ctried to help that guy.\u201d",
      "Dugan's attorneys have countered during cross-examinations that Dugan didn't intend to obstruct the arrest team and was trying to follow a draft courthouse policy from Ashley that called for court employees to refer immigration agents looking to make an arrest in the courthouse to supervisors.",
      "They've also argued that the arrest team could have apprehended Flores-Ruiz at any point after he emerged from the courtroom and Dugan shouldn't be blamed for their decision to wait until he got outside.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett, who traveled the world covering wars from Vietnam to Iraq, has died",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Peter Arnett, the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who spent decades dodging bullets and bombs to bring the world eyewitness accounts of war from the rice paddies of Vietnam to the deserts of Iraq, has died. He was 91.",
      "Arnett, who won the 1966 Pulitzer Prize for international reporting for his Vietnam War coverage for The Associated Press, died Wednesday in Newport Beach and was surrounded by friends and family, said his son Andrew Arnett. He had been suffering from prostate cancer.",
      "\u201cPeter Arnett was one of the greatest war correspondents of his generation \u2014 intrepid, fearless, and a beautiful writer and storyteller. His reporting in print and on camera will remain a legacy for aspiring journalists and historians for generations to come,\u201d said Edith Lederer, who was a fellow AP war correspondent in Vietnam in 1972-73 and is now AP\u2019s chief correspondent at the United Nations.",
      "As a wire-service correspondent, Arnett was known mostly to fellow journalists when he reported in Vietnam from 1962 until the war's end in 1975. He became something of a household name in 1991, however, after he broadcast live updates for CNN from Iraq during the first Gulf War.",
      "While almost all Western reporters had fled Baghdad in the days before the U.S.-led attack, Arnett stayed. As missiles began raining on the city, he broadcast a live account by cellphone from his hotel room.",
      "\"There was an explosion right near me, you may have heard,\" he said in a calm, New Zealand-accented voice moments after the loud boom of a missile strike rattled across the airwaves. As he continued to speak air-raid sirens blared in the background.",
      "\"I think that took out the telecommunications center,\" he said of another explosion. \u201cThey are hitting the center of the city.\u201d",
      "It was not the first time Arnett had gotten dangerously close to the action.",
      "In January 1966, he joined a battalion of U.S. soldiers seeking to rout North Vietnamese snipers and was standing next to the battalion commander when an officer paused to read a map.",
      "\"As the colonel peered at it, I heard four loud shots as bullets tore through the map and into his chest, a few inches from my face,\u201d Arnett recalled during a talk to the American Library Association in 2013. \u201cHe sank to the ground at my feet.\u201d",
      "He would begin the fallen soldier\u2019s obituary like this: \"He was the son of a general, a West Pointer and a battalion commander. But Lt. Colonel George Eyster was to die like a rifleman. It may have been the colonel's leaves of rank on his collar, or the map he held in his hand, or just a wayward chance that the Viet Cong sniper chose Eyster from the five of us standing in that dusty jungle path.\"",
      "Arnett had arrived in Vietnam just a year after joining AP as its Indonesia correspondent. That job would be short-lived after he reported Indonesia\u2019s economy was in shambles and the country\u2019s enraged leadership threw him out. His expulsion marked only the first of several controversies in which he would find himself embroiled, while also forging an historic career.",
      "At the AP\u2019s Saigon bureau in 1962, Arnett found himself surrounded by a formidable roster of journalists, including bureau chief Malcolm Browne and photo editor Horst Faas, who between them would win three Pulitzer Prizes.",
      "He credited Browne in particular with teaching him many of the survival tricks that would keep him alive in war zones over the next 40 years. Among them: Never stand near a medic or radio operator because they're among the first the enemy will shoot at. And if you hear a gunshot coming from the other side, don't look around to see who fired it because the next one will likely hit you.",
      "Arnett would stay in Vietnam until the capital, Saigon, fell to the Communist-backed North Vietnamese rebels in 1975. In the time leading up to those final days, he was ordered by AP\u2019s New York headquarters to begin destroying the bureau\u2019s papers as coverage of the war wound down.",
      "Instead, he shipped them to his apartment in New York, believing they\u2019d have historic value someday. They\u2019re now in the AP\u2019s archives.",

      "After his dismissal, TV critics for the AP and other news organizations speculated that Arnett would never work in television news again. Within a week, however, he had been hired to report on the war for stations in Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates and Belgium.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Donald Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all. U.S.-Chinese tensions have ebbed and flowed during Trump\u2019s second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China\u2019s increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has said must reunify with the mainland.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \u201cU.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient\u2019s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\u201d the statements said.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",

      "\u201cThis cannot save the doomed fate of \u2018Taiwan independence\u2019 but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for \u2018Taiwan Independence\u2019 through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\u201d he added.",

      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense.

      "UNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday approved former Iraqi President Barham Salih as the next head of the U.N. refugee agency, its first from the Middle East since the late 1970s.",
      "The 193-member world body elected the 65-year-old Kurdish politician as the U.N. high commissioner for refugees by consensus and a bang of the gavel by Assembly President Annalena Baerbock. Diplomats in the assembly chamber burst into applause as Salih\u2019s election became official.",
      "U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, a former refugee chief who recommended Salih for the post, said he brings \u201csenior diplomatic, political and administrative leadership experience\u201d to the job, including as \u201ca refugee, crisis negotiator and architect of national reforms.\u201d",
      "At the age of 19 in 1979, Salih was reportedly arrested twice by Saddam Hussein\u2019s Baath Party on charges of involvement in the Kurdish national movement and spent 43 days in detention. When he was released, he finished high school and fled to the United Kingdom to avoid further persecution.",
      "After Saddam was ousted by a U.S.-led coalition in 2003, Salih returned to Iraq and held various posts in the government. He became Iraq\u2019s president in 2018, in the immediate aftermath of the Islamic State group\u2019s rampage across Iraq and the battle to take back the territory seized by the extremist group. He served until 2022.",

      "The river's future was the center of discussions this week at the annual Colorado River Water Users Association conference in Las Vegas, where water leaders from California, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming gathered alongside federal and tribal officials.",
      "It comes after the states blew past a November deadline for a new plan to deal with drought and water shortages after 2026, when current guidelines expire. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has set a new deadline of Feb. 14.",

      "More than 40 million people across seven states, Mexico and Native American tribes depend on the water from the river. Farmers in California and Arizona use it to grow the nation's winter vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and carrots. It provides water and electricity to millions of homes and businesses across the basin.",
      "But longstanding drought, chronic overuse and increasing temperatures have forced a reckoning on the river's future. Existing water conservation agreements that determine who must use less in times of shortage expire in 2026. After two years of negotiating, states still haven't reached a deal for what comes next.",
      "The federal government continues to refrain from coming up with its own solution \u2014 preferring the seven basin states reach consensus themselves. If they don't, a federally imposed plan could leave parties unhappy and result in costly, lengthy litigation.",
      "Not only is this water fight between the upper and lower basins, individual municipalities, tribal nations and water agencies have their own stakes in this battle. California, which has the largest share of Colorado River water, has over 200 water agencies alone, each with their own customers.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida's Supreme Court has upheld a state law allowing nonunanimous juries to sentence people to death, cementing the lowest bar in the country for death sentences at a time when the state is driving a national increase in executions.",
      "In a decision released Thursday, the court affirmed a 2023 law that ended a unanimous jury requirement in death penalty sentencing, rejecting arguments by death row inmates Michael Hunt and Michael Jackson that their sentences are unconstitutional.",
      "Florida law allows capital punishment with a jury recommendation of at least 8-4 in favor of execution, the lowest standard in the nation, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Alabama is the only other state to allow the imposition of death sentences by nonunanimous juries, with the slightly higher threshold of 10-2.",
      "Florida lawmakers passed the nonunanimous jury measure in response to a verdict that spared the life of the school shooter who killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.",
      "Florida's death penalty sentencing requirements have shifted repeatedly in recent years, following legal challenges and changes on the state's high court, where five of the seven justices were appointed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "For decades, Florida had not required unanimity in capital punishment, allowing a judge to impose the death penalty as long as a majority of jurors were in favor of the penalty. But in 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the state's system, saying it allowed judges too much discretion.",
      "The state Legislature then passed a bill requiring a 10-2 jury recommendation, but the state Supreme Court at the time said such recommendations should be unanimous, prompting lawmakers in 2017 to require a unanimous jury.",

      "The Trump administration included five more countries as well as people traveling on documents issued by the Palestinian Authority to the list of countries facing a full ban on travel to the U.S. and imposed new limits on 15 other countries.",
      "The move is part of ongoing efforts by the administration to tighten U.S. entry standards for travel and immigration, in what critics say unfairly prevents travel for people from a broad range of countries. The administration suggested it would expand the restrictions after the arrest of an Afghan national suspect in the shooting of two National Guard troops over Thanksgiving weekend.",
      "People who already have visas, are lawful permanent residents of the U.S. or have certain visa categories such as diplomats or athletes, or whose entry into the country is believed to serve the U.S. interest, are all exempt from the restrictions. The proclamation said the changes go into effect on Jan. 1.",
      "In June, President Donald Trump announced that citizens of 12 countries would be banned from coming to the United States and those from seven others would face restrictions. The decision resurrected a hallmark policy of his first term.",
      "At the time the ban included Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen and heightened restrictions on visitors from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the Republican administration announced it was expanding the list of countries whose citizens are banned from entering the U.S. to Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria. The administration also fully restricted travel on people with Palestinian Authority-issued travel documents, the latest U.S. travel restriction against Palestinians. South Sudan was also facing significant travel restrictions already.",
      "An additional 15 countries are also being added to the list of countries facing partial restrictions: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Ivory Coast, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe.",
      "The restrictions apply to both people seeking to travel to the U.S. as visitors or to emigrate there.",
      "The Trump administration said in its announcement that many of the countries from which it was restricting travel had \u201cwidespread corruption, fraudulent or unreliable civil documents and criminal records\u201d that made it difficult to vet their citizens for travel to the U.S.",
      "It also said some countries had high rates of people overstaying their visas, refused to take back their citizens whom the U.S. wished to deport or had a \u201cgeneral lack of stability and government control,\u201d which made vetting difficult. It also cited immigration enforcement, foreign policy and national security concerns for the move.",
      "The Afghan man accused of shooting the two National Guard troops near the White House has pleaded not guilty to murder and assault charges. In the aftermath of that incident, the administration announced a flurry of immigration restrictions, including further restrictions on people from those initial 19 countries who were already in the U.S.",

      "No One Left Behind, a longtime agency advocating for the Special Immigrant Visa program, said it was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the change. The organization said it appreciated the president's commitment to national security but allowing Afghans who'd served the U.S. to enter the U.S. \u2014 after extensive vetting \u2014 also contributes to the country's security.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is nearing final passage Wednesday of an annual military policy bill that will authorize $901 billion in defense programs while pressuring Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to provide lawmakers with video of strikes on alleged drug boats in international water near Venezuela.",
      "The annual National Defense Authorization Act, which would raise troop pay by 3.8%, gained bipartisan backing as it moved through the Senate, and the White House has indicated that it is in line with President Donald Trump's national security priorities. However, the legislation, which ran over 3,000 pages, revealed some points of friction between Congress and the Pentagon as the Trump administration reorients its focus away from security in Europe and towards Central and South America.",
      "The bill pushes back on recent moves by the Pentagon. It demands more information on boat strikes in the Caribbean, requires that the U.S. keep its troop levels in Europe at current levels and sends some military aid to Ukraine.",
      "But overall, the bill represents a compromise between the parties. It implements many of Trump's executive orders and proposals on eliminating diversity and inclusion efforts in the military and grants emergency military powers at the U.S. border with Mexico. It also enhances congressional oversight of the Department of Defense and repeals several years-old war authorizations.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune said it was part of the \u201cinvestment that we need to be making to ensure that in a dangerous world we are prepared to defend America and American interests.\u201d",
      "Still, the sprawling bill faced objections from both Democratic and Republican leadership on the Senate Commerce Committee. That's because the legislation allows military aircraft to obtain a waiver to operate without broadcasting their precise location, as an Army helicopter had done before a midair collision with an airliner in Washington, D.C. in January that killed 67 people.",
      "\"The special carve-out was exactly what caused the January 29th crash that claimed 67 lives,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said at a news conference this week.",
      "Cruz said he was seeking a vote on bipartisan legislation in the next month that would require military aircraft to use a precise location sharing tool and improve coordination between commercial and military aircraft in busy areas.",
      "Republicans and Democrats agreed to language in the defense bill that threatens to withhold a quarter of Hegseth\u2019s travel budget until he provides unedited video of the strikes with the House and Senate Committees on Armed Services, as well as the orders authorizing them.",
      "Hegseth was on Capitol Hill Tuesday ahead of the bill's passage to brief lawmakers on the U.S. military campaign in international water near Venezuela. The briefing elicited contrasting responses from many lawmakers, with Republicans largely backing the campaign and Democrats expressing concern about it and saying they had not received enough information.",
      "The committees are investigating a Sept. 2 strike \u2014 the first of the campaign \u2014 that killed two people who had survived an initial attack on their boat. The Navy admiral who ordered the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d strike, Adm. Frank \u201cMitch\u201d Bradley, was also appearing before the committees Wednesday in a classified briefing that will also include video of the strike in question.",

The defense legislation requires that Congress be kept in the loop on decisions like that going forward, as well as when top military brass are removed.",
      "The Pentagon is also required, under the legislation, to keep at least 76,000 troops and major equipment stationed in Europe unless NATO allies are consulted and there is a determination that such a withdrawal is in U.S. interests. Around 80,000 to 100,000 U.S. troops are usually present on European soil. A similar requirement also keeps the number of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea at 28,500.",
      "Lawmakers are also pushing back on some Pentagon decisions by authorizing $400 million for each of the next two years to manufacture weapons to be sent to Ukraine.",
      "Trump and Hegseth have made it a priority to purge the military of material and programs that address diversity, anti-racism or gender issues, and the defense bill would codify many of those changes. It will repeal diversity, equity and inclusion offices and trainings, including the position of chief diversity officer. Those cuts would save the Pentagon about $40 million, according to the Republican-controlled House Armed Services Committee.",
      "The U.S. military has long found that climate change is a threat to how it provides national security because weather-related disasters can destroy military bases and equipment. But the bill makes $1.6 billion in cuts by eliminating climate-change related programs at the Pentagon.",

Now that Iraq is a strategic partner of the U.S., lawmakers in support of the provision say the repeal is crucial to prevent future abuses. The bill also repeals the 1991 authorization that sanctioned the U.S.-led Gulf War.",

The nation is rebuilding after its former leader Bashar Assad was deposed, and supporters of the new government say that permanently lifting the sanctions will spur the country's economic reconstruction and encourage the establishment of democracy.",

    "story": [
      "Tennessee's governor pardoned country star Jelly Roll on Thursday for his criminal past in the state, acknowledging the Nashville native's long road back from drugs and prison through soul-searching, songwriting and advocacy for second chances.",
      "The rapper-turned-singer, whose legal name is Jason Deford, has spoken for years about his redemption arc before diverse audiences, from people serving time in correctional centers to concert crowds and even in testimony before Congress.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee issued his pardon after friends and civic leaders of the Grammy-nominated musician joined in an outpouring of support.",
      "He has said a pardon would make it easier for him to travel internationally for concert tours and to perform Christian missionary work without requiring burdensome paperwork.",
      "He was one of 33 people to receive pardons Thursday from Lee, who for years has issued clemency decisions around the Christmas season. Lee said Jelly Roll's application underwent the same monthslong thorough review as other applicants. The state parole board gave a nonbinding, unanimous recommendation for Jelly Roll's pardon in April.",
      "\"His story is remarkable, and it's a redemptive, powerful story, which is what you look for and what you hope for,\" Lee told reporters, adding he hopes to meet Jelly Roll for the first time soon.",
      "Beginning at the age of 14, Jelly Roll was in and out of jail for about a decade for convictions including aggravated robbery, shoplifting, drug possession and drug dealing.",
      "In January 2024, \"CBS Sunday Morning\" interviewed Jelly Roll inside the Metro-Davidson County Detention Facility in Nashville, where he had once been an inmate. At the time, Jelly Roll had just been nominated for two Grammys.",
      "\"There was a time in my life where I truly thought \u2026 this was it,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"And then coming here, you know, just after getting nominated for two Grammys, it just hits different\u2026I didn't think I'd get emotional, to be honest.",
      "He told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" he wrote hundreds of songs while in jail.",
      "Unlike recent high-profile federal pardons, which let people off the hook for prison, a pardon in Tennessee serves as a statement of forgiveness for someone who has already completed a prison sentence and been released. Pardons offer a path to get certain civil rights restored, such as the right to vote, although there are some limitations under state law, and the governor can specify the terms.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \"Whitsitt Chapel\" and crossover songs like \"Need a Favor.\" He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and also picked up seven career Grammy nominations, three of them recently.",
      "Much of his work has become associated with overcoming adversity, like the song \"Winning Streak\" that tells the story of someone's first day sober. Or the direct-and-to-the-point, \"I Am Not Okay.\"",
      "In making his case to the parole board, Jelly Roll said he first fell in love with songwriting while in custody, stating it began as a therapeutic passion project that \"would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable.\"",
      "Beyond his sold-out shows, he's brought his story to the Senate, where he testified in January 2024 about the dangers of fentanyl, describing his drug-dealing younger self as \"the uneducated man in the kitchen playing chemist with drugs I knew absolutely nothing about.\"",
      "\"I was a part of the problem,\" he told lawmakers at the time. \"I am here now standing as a man that wants to be a part of the solution.\"",
      "Jelly Roll's most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. Jelly Roll was unarmed, and was sentenced to one year in prison plus probation.",
      "In another run-in 2008, police found marijuana and crack cocaine in his car, leading to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "Friends and civic leaders backed the pardon application, citing Jelly Roll's transformation.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who runs Nashville's jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino cited Jelly Roll's donations from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks the state's five-year timeline for eligibility after his sentence expired. Prominent Nashville attorney David Raybin represents Jelly Roll in the pardon case.",
      "Lee's office said no one was pardoned Thursday who had a homicide or a sex-related conviction, or for any crime committed as an adult against a minor.",

      "Gloria Gaynor's\u00a0\"I Will Survive\" has been a motivational anthem for nearly five\u00a0decades \u2013 but it didn't just serve as inspiration for millions of fans. Gaynor told \"CBS Mornings\" the song gave her hope during one of the most difficult periods of her life.",
      "After a fall on stage in 1978 at New York's Beacon Theatre, Gaynor suffered a serious spinal injury and spent months in recovery. Many thought her career was over, but during that painful healing, she recorded what would become a smash hit, \"I Will Survive.\"",
      "\"I was living that song\"",
      "The song won a Grammy for best disco recording in 1980 \u2013 the only time that category existed. In 2016, it was inducted into the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry for its cultural significance. Now, Gaynor is a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree for her lifetime artistic achievements.",
      "The track was supposed to be a B-side, but Gaynor immediately knew it was a winner. When she was recording it, standing in a back brace, she felt a deep connection to the music",
      "\"[I was] hoping I'd survive, you know, this trauma that I was going through, hoping that I survived the fact that my mother had just passed away a few years prior. Yeah, I was living that song and I was certain that I wouldn't be the only one,\" she said.",
      "The song became her anthem \u2013 and the world's \u2013 with over 200 covers in more than 20 different languages. And, of course, it sparked several trends on social media.",
      "Just a girl from Jersey",
      "Before becoming the \"queen of disco,\" Gaynor was just a girl from Newark, New Jersey. Her talent went unnoticed until a neighbor heard her sing and she was called up to the stage at a club one night to perform.",
      "She eventually worked the nightclub circuit. Her big break came from a meeting with legendary record executive Clive Davis, who helped propel her to the center of disco. Her 1975 debut album, \"Never Can Say Goodbye,\" was one of the first disco albums to top the charts, cracking the top 25 on the Billboard 200.",
      "Early in her career, Gaynor said she was singing R&B but decided she really wanted to give people music to dance to.",
      "\"I remember that discotheques were very, very new. There were just a couple and what they were was cabaret clubs where they'd just taken away the chairs,\" she recalled.",
      "Her profile continued to grow as she toured the world. As disco faded in the 1980s, Gaynor kept performing around the world. Years later, she found a new purpose through faith and gospel music. Her 2019 album, \"Testimony,\" earned her a Grammy, proving her voice still inspires.",
      "Lessons for new artists",
      "Now, nearly 50 years after her rise to fame, Gaynor is honored with one of the nation's highest distinctions: the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "\"I got a phone call from my manager and I was ecstatic,\" said Gaynor as she learned about the award. \"It was incredible to even think about being accepted as one who deserved that.\"",
      "Gaynor is now parting her wisdom to new artists. Her top takeaway: Don't set out to seek rewards.",
      "\" I would say to them, be about doing the best you can with what God gave you,\" she said. \"All of that stuff is extra.\u00a0 I didn't strive to get a Grammy. I strive to do the best song I could do at that time.\u00a0 I strive to touch people's hearts. I strive to uplift, encourage, and power people And so, be about that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Before he was two-time world heavyweight boxing champion Rocky Balboa, he was just little Sylvester \"Sly\" Stallone with the unusually deep voice.",
      "His voice and slurred speech were the result of an injury during childbirth that also caused facial drooping \u2014 a condition for which he was relentlessly bullied. And life at home wasn't much easier. When his parents divorced in 1957, when he was 11, he moved in with his father, who he says was emotionally and physically abusive.",
      "\"It's hard to navigate because you're going to catch it, especially when you're a bit rebellious like me. You're going to get a beating. After a while, you learn to just expect it,\" Stallone told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King during an interview inside his Florida home.",
      "He found solace in the silver screen.",
      "\"I worshipped escapism,\" explained Stallone, especially mythical heroes like Hercules.",
      "Stallone's \"Rocky\" road to success",
      "In his early 20s, he moved to New York City to pursue his dreams, teaching himself to write after struggling as a young actor. In 1975, he wrote a film that would change everything: \"Rocky.\"",
      "At the time, the studio didn't want Stallone to star in his own film, but he insisted. It was a gamble that paid off \u2014 \"Rocky\" went on to win three Academy Awards, including best picture. What should have been one of the happiest nights of his life was also one of the saddest.",
      "\"I mean, it's a volcanic moment, and then it was very sad,\" said Stallone, choking up.",
      "Stallone's parents didn't attend the Oscars as his guests when he was nominated for the award in 1977.",
      "\"You want people that you love that denied you, now you're here, you're at the Oscars, and they don't want to go,\" he continued. \"You realize that, at that moment, that you're never ever going to come to terms with this. And it's like, what more do you need? Really, what f\u2014ing more do you need to do to say, 'I'm here.'\"",
      "For Stallone, it was a valuable lesson.",
      "\"Parents should really wise up. Kids are the same as soft clay. They really are. You mold them, and you dent them, and you hurt them, or you drop them off the table, and they're not the same shape anymore,\" he said. \"I still walk around with it. And I wish I couldn't. And I pray, and I do everything, but it's always there.\"",
      "Stallone, who was recently named a 2025 Kennedy Center honoree, hopes his story can help inspire others to pursue their dreams against all odds.",
      "He told King about his hopes for his legacy: \"I really want to be a symbol for how an average person, really an average person, can overcome overwhelming odds.\"",
      "Stallone clarifies his cinematic origin story",
      "Though \"Rocky\" is frequently described as a sports drama, Stallone disagrees \u2014 and wants to set the record straight.",
      "\"The toughest thing about Rocky, and even to this day, I bristle when I hear it's a sports movie. It's not. It's a love story,\" he said. \"It starts with love.\"",
      "According to Stallone, the real triumph of \"Rocky\" is the evolving love between Rocky and Adrian, portrayed by Talia Shire. The film, he said, \"will rise and fall on love, not fights.\"",
      "From commercial highs to comeback hits",
      "Following the success of \"Rocky,\" Stallone co-wrote and starred in another blockbuster, \"Rambo.\" He played John Rambo, who he refers to as his alter ego.",
      "\"He's my father,\" he explained. \"100%. That's all I had to do was clone him, but the difference is Rambo is sad. Rambo is a disenfranchised child, he was a child of America. And America asked him to do a chore, he did the chore, and he was \u2013 it rejected him.\"",
      "After two hit franchises early in his career, he endured a series of box office flops.",
      "\"It was more than a drought. It was about eight years of spiderwebs on the phone,\" he recalled, admitting he was \"crumbling\" at the time.",
      "Everything changed when Rocky Balboa made a comeback in 2006. And then the work kept on coming. He's currently filming Season 4 of his hit Paramount+ show \"Tulsa King.\"",

      "As a director, he was known for acclaimed movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" \"A Few Good Men,\" \"Stand By Me\" and \"This is Spinal Tap.\" A sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "His wife was a photographer who took the photo of President Trump used on the cover of his book \"The Art of the Deal,\" according to Variety.",
      "The couple married in 1989 and had three children, sons Nick and Jake and daughter Romy. Reiner was previously married to the late director Penny Marshall, and is the adoptive father of her daughter, actress Tracy Reiner.",
      "The family of Norman Lear, the legendary producer of \"All in the Family\" who died in 2023 at age 101, said Lear \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\" In a statement, the Lear family said, \"Norman would have wanted to remind us that Rob and Michele spent every breath trying to make this country a better place, and they pursued that through their art, their activism, their philanthropy, and their love for family and friends.\"",
      "In \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026,\" Reiner famously featured a brief appearance from his mother, Estelle, who delivered the iconic line, \"I'll have what she's having.\" It was also during the filming of \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" that Rob Reiner first met Michele. In a 2016 interview with AV Club, he said meeting her was what made him change the ending of the movie to have Harry and Sally end up together.",
      "Hollywood, political leaders react",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said in a statement Sunday night: \"This is a devastating loss for our city and our country. Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice. An acclaimed actor, director, producer, writer, and engaged political activist, he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement that he and his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, were \"heartbroken by the tragic loss of Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner.\"",
      "\"Rob was the big-hearted genius behind so many of the classic stories we love, with projects as wide-ranging as 'The Princess Bride' to 'A Few Good Men.' His boundless empathy made his stories timeless, teaching generations how to see goodness and righteousness in others \u2014 and encouraging us to dream bigger,\" Newsom said.",
      "Former President Joe Biden said, \"Jill and I send our deepest condolences to everyone whose lives were touched by Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner's extraordinary contributions. We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama said in a statement, \"Michelle and I are heartbroken by the tragic passing of Rob Reiner and his beloved wife, Michele. Rob's achievements in film and television gave us some of our most cherished stories on screen. But beneath all of the stories he produced was a deep belief in the goodness of people\u2014and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action.\"",
      "Former President Bill Clinton said Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former House Speaker and current Rep. Nancy Pelosi called word of the Reiners' deaths \"devastating. It's hard to think of anyone more remarkable and excellent in every field and endeavor they pursued. Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michele was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and loving wife.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, the newly elected president of the Screen Actors' Guild, called Rob Reiner \"one of those most significant figures in the history of film and television.\" He said Reiner's impact on American culture \"simply can't be overstated.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner, the son of a comedy giant who became one himself with movies such as \"The Princess Bride,\" \"When Harry Met Sally\u2026\" and \"This is Spinal Tap,\" is being remembered for his iconic contributions to entertainment following the shocking news of his death.",
      "Reiner, 78, and his wife, Michele Singer, were found dead Sunday at their home in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, in what police called an \"apparent homicide.\" Their son Nick Reiner was arrested on murder charges.",
      "\"It is with profound sorrow that we announce the tragic passing of Michele and Rob Reiner. We are heartbroken by this sudden loss, and we ask for privacy during this unbelievably difficult time,\" their family said in a statement obtained by Variety and other outlets.",
      "Robert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947. As a young man, he set out to follow in his father's footsteps into entertainment. He studied at the University of California, Los Angeles film school and, in the 1960s, began appearing in small parts in various television shows.",
      "Reiner grew up thinking his father, Carl Reiner, didn't understand him or find him funny. But the younger Reiner would in many ways emulate his career, working both in front of and behind the camera.",
      "\"My father thought, 'Oh, my God, this poor kid is worried about being in the shadow of a famous father,'\" Reiner told \u00a0\"60 Minutes\"\u00a0earlier this year, recalling the temptation to change his name. \"And he says, 'What do you want to change your name to?' And I said, 'Carl.' I just wanted to be like him.\"",
      "He added, \"Norman Lear was the first person that got me. I mean, I was playing jacks with his daughter. Norman says to my dad, 'You know, this kid is really funny.' And I think my dad said, 'What? That kid?' That kid? He's ... sullen, he sits quiet. He doesn't-- you know, he's not funny.'\"",
      "After starting out as a writer for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" Reiner's breakthrough came when he was, at age 23, cast by producer and family friend Norman Lear in \"All in the Family\" as Archie Bunker's liberal son-in-law, Michael \"Meathead\" Stivic. Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that he thought the show would only last 13 weeks \u2014 but it went on to air for eight years, five of them as the top show in the country.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant,\" he told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2010. \"There's no way that this is going to fly on American television.\"",
      "Reiner was five times nominated for an Emmy for his performance on the show, winning in 1974 and 1978. In Lear, Reiner also found a mentor. He called him \"a second father.\"",
      "Lear, who\u00a0died in 2023 at age 101, reciprocated the feeling. The Lear family said in a statement Sunday night that he \"often referred to Rob as a son, and their close relationship was extraordinary.\"",
      "It was during the end of Reiner's stint on the show that he came up with the idea for his first film: the largely improvised 1984 cult classic \"This is Spinal Tap,\" which lovingly spoofed a fictional British rock band. The sequel, \"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues,\" was released this fall.",
      "\"Well, people would say, 'I can't believe your first movie would be improvised, there'd be no script. And that's scary.' And, to me, it was the opposite. I wasn't scared,\" he told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The film kicked off a four-year stretch that resulted in a trio of American classics \u2014 \"Stand By Me\" (1986), \"The Princess Bride\" (1987) and \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\" (1989)\u00a0 \u2014 all of them among the most often quoted movies of the 20th century.",
      "Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" that \"Stand by Me,\" his 1986 film adaptation of the Stephen King novella \"The Body,\" was in many ways based on his relationship with his father.",
      "\"I'm writing this scene, I'm crying. I actually cry. When I was making it I knew that he loved me and he did understand me, but as a little boy that's what I felt,\" he said.",
      "The movie, about four boys who go looking for the dead body of a missing boy, became a coming-of-age classic, making breakthroughs of its young cast, particularly River Phoenix. One of those co-stars, Jerry O'Connell, spoke to \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday and described the news as \"just surreal.\"",
      "\"Rob was like a father to me,\" O'Connell said. \"Everything I have is because of Rob Reiner. Everything I have.\"",
      "With his stock rising, Reiner devoted himself to adapting William Goldman's \"The Princess Bride,\" a 1973 book Reiner had loved since his father gave him a copy as a gift. Everyone from Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut to Robert Redford had considered adapting Goldman's book, but it ultimately fell to Reiner (from Goldman's own script) to capture the unique comic tone of \"The Princess Bride.\" But only once he had Goldman's blessing.",
      "\"At the door he greeted me and he said, 'This is my baby. I want this on my tombstone. This is my favorite thing I've ever written in my life. What are you going to do with it?'\" Reiner recalled in a Television Academy interview. \"And we sat down with him and started going through what I thought should be done with the film.\"",
      "Though only a modest success in theaters, the movie \u2014 starring Cary Elwes, Mandy Patinkin, Wallace Shawn, Andr\u00e9 the Giant and Robin Wright \u2014 would grow in stature over the years, leading to countless impressions of Inigo Montoya's vow of revenge and the risky nature of land wars in Asia.",
      "For the next four decades, Reiner, a warm and gregarious presence on screen and an outspoken liberal advocate off it, remained a constant fixture in Hollywood. The production company he co-founded, Castle Rock Entertainment, launched an enviable string of hits, including \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" By the turn of the century, its success rate had fallen considerably, but Reiner revived it earlier this decade. This fall, Reiner and Castle Rock released the long-in-coming sequel\u00a0\"Spinal Tap II: The End Continues.\"",
      "\"What are we, crazy to do another one? It's crazy,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes\" about the sequel. \"The bar is just way too high.\"",
      "All the while, Reiner was one of the film industry's most passionate Democrat activists, regularly hosting fundraisers and campaigning for liberal issues. He was co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which challenged in court California's ban on same-sex marriage, Proposition 8. He also chaired the campaign for Prop 10, a California initiative to fund early childhood development services with a tax on tobacco products. Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump.",
      "That ran in the family, too. Reiner's father opposed the Communist hunt of McCarthyism in the 1950s and his mother, Estelle Reiner, a singer and actor, protested the Vietnam War.",
      "\"If you're a nepo baby, doors will open,\" Reiner told The Guardian in 2024. \"But you have to deliver. If you don't deliver, the door will close just as fast as it opened.\"",
      "Reiner was married to Penny Marshall, the actor and filmmaker, for 10 years beginning in 1971. Like Reiner, Marshall experienced sitcom fame with \"Laverne & Shirley,\" but found a more lasting legacy behind the camera. Marshall\u00a0died in 2018.",
      "After their divorce, Reiner, at a lunch with Nora Ephron, suggested a comedy about dating. In writing what became \"When Harry Met Sally \u2026\", Ephron and Reiner charted a relationship between a man and a woman \u2014 memorably played in the film by Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan \u2014 over the course of 12 years.",
      "Along the way, the movie's ending changed, as did some of the film's indelible moments. The famous line, \"I'll have what she's having,\" said after witnessing Ryan's fake orgasm at Katz's Delicatessen, was a suggestion by Crystal \u2014 delivered by none other than Reiner's mother, Estelle.",
      "\"I'm pounding the table, 'Yes! Yes! Yes!' And I'm realizing I'm having an orgasm in front of my mother, you know? There's my mother over there,\" Reiner told \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "The movie's happy ending also had some real-life basis. Reiner said he changed it after meeting Singer, a photographer, on the set of the film. They married In 1989, and had three children together: Nick, Jake and Romy.",
      "Reiner's subsequent films included another King adaptation, \"Misery\" (1990) and a pair of Aaron Sorkin-penned dramas: the military courtroom tale \"A Few Good Men\" (1992) and 1995's \"The American President.\"",
      "By the late '90s, Reiner's films (1996's \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" 2007's \"The Bucket List\") no longer had the same success rate. But he remained a frequent actor, often memorably enlivening films like \"Sleepless in Seattle\" (1993) and \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" (2013). In 2023, he directed the documentary \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life.\"",
      "In the interview with \"60 Minutes\" this year, Reiner said he never had any idea if his films would work.",
      "\"If I like it, then I say, 'Well, at least I like it,'\" Reiner said. \"Hopefully somebody else is gonna like it.\"",

      "Anthony Geary, who rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as half the daytime TV super couple Luke and Laura on \"General Hospital,\" has died. He was 78.",

      "\"The entire 'General Hospital' family is heartbroken over the news of Tony Geary's passing,\" Frank Valentini, executive producer of the ABC show, said in a statement Monday. \"Tony was a brilliant actor and set the bar that we continue to strive for.\"",
      "In a career spanning more than 40 years, Geary earned eight Daytime Emmy awards as Luke Spencer after joining the soap in 1978. Luke's pairing with Genie Francis' Laura Webber Baldwin (as she was known at the time) propelled the two onto magazine covers and into the cultural mainstream.",
      "The 1981 wedding of Luke and Laura was a pop culture phenomenon done in two parts, drawing guest appearances that included Elizabeth Taylor. A record 30 million viewers watched.",
      "\"He was a powerhouse as an actor. Shoulder to shoulder with the greats. No star burned brighter than Tony Geary. He was one of a kind. As an artist, he was filled with a passion for the truth, no matter how blunt, or even a little rude it might be, but always hilariously funny,\" Francis said in a statement.",

      "\"I felt like I had to be Luke 24 hours a day or people would be disappointed,\" he said at the time. \"As far as I'm concerned, they are mythic creatures. They come from two sides of the universe together and have a mutual connection, which is basically lust and appreciation for individuality. They love the eccentricity in each other.\"",
      "Geary's Luke began as a small-time hitman recruited to dismantle the relationship of Laura and her first husband, Scotty Baldwin. Their story arc turned darker when Luke sexually assaulted Laura. The assault led to a redemption trail for Luke, who evolved into a hero and even served as mayor of the show's small town, Port Charles.",
      "\"He was not created to be a heroic character,\" Geary told ABC's \"Nightline\" in 2015. \"He was created to be an anti-hero, and I have treasured the anti-side of the hero and pushed it for a long time. ... He's not a white hat or a black hat, he's all shades of grey. And that has been the saving grace of playing him all these years.\"",
      "Geary was born to Mormon parents in Coalville, Utah. He was discovered while attending the University of Utah and performing on stage. He joined a touring company of \"The Subject Was Roses,\" which brought him to Los Angeles.",
      "Over the years, he appeared frequently in stage productions alongside his screen work.",
      "Geary's first appearance on TV was as Tom Whalom on an episode of \"Room 222.\" He went on to appear in \"All in the Family,\" \"The Partridge Family,\" \"The Mod Squad,\" \"Marcus Welby, M.D.,\" \"The Streets of San Francisco\" and \"Barnaby Jones.\"",

    "summary": "In their new movie, \"Song Sung Blue,\" Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson play Mike and Claire Sardina, the real-life musical impersonators from Milwaukee who sang as the Neil Diamond tribute act Lightning & Thunder.",
    "story": [
      "Last week, at a New York bar called Old Mates, Australian icon Hugh Jackman sang a few songs by an American icon, Neil Diamond. He's been doing a lot of this lately.",
      "His new film, \"Song Sung Blue,\" is based on the real-life story of Mike and Claire Sardina, celebrity impersonators who teamed up to form a Neil Diamond tribute act by the name of Lightning & Thunder. Jackman was cast early on as Mike, and director Craig Brewer was still looking for someone to play Claire, when Jackman got an idea from watching TV: \"Yeah. It's this little-known show, 'CBS Sunday Morning,'\" he said.",
      "In April 2024, \"Sunday Morning\" aired a profile of Kate Hudson and her blossoming music career.",
      "Jackman was contacted by a friend and assistant, Michelle: \"She texts me: 'Are you watching \"CBS Sunday Morning\"?' I said, 'I'm not.' Normally I am, by the way \u2013 that sounded sucky, but it's true! I normally am! And I wasn't \u2013 I turned it on, and there was Kate promoting her debut solo album. I texted Craig Brewer, the writer-director, and I said, 'Kate Hudson is Claire. Claire is Kate.' And he said, 'Oh my God, perfect.'\"",
      "\"Perfect\" might be the right word: Hudson's turn as Claire Sardina has already earned her a Golden Globe nomination.",
      "Jackman said, \"As much as i could see it and feel it, nothing prepared me from day one of rehearsal through to the end, 'til I saw the movie, of Kate's performance. Because it was like, I could feel \u2013 you know, you just know, like, 'Ah, she's gonna be perfect,' 'cause she's amazing, and I love her, and I love her as an actress. But when there's somehow an alchemy of a part to an actress at that time, when that all comes together? Magic.\"",
      "The performances are magical, but what happened to the Sardinas off stage was anything but: between gigs, they endured poverty, addiction, and some incredibly bad luck.",
      "\"They go through so much,\" Hudson said. \"And if it wasn't a true story, it would almost be \u2013 you wouldn't believe it, you know?\"",
      "The film is at its heart a love story, and you could say the two lead actors have chemistry to burn. Yet, Jackman and Hudson did not know each other well before the project began. \"It's become a bit of a joke,\" said Jackman. \"Because I remember when we first met, but she has no recollection. That's the impression I made!\"",
      "And now?\u00a0 \"Oh, well, very well,\" said Hudson. \"Except consummating. Beyond that, pretty, pretty much everything!\"",
      "Hudson was apprehensive when Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell watched the film: \"Everyone loved the movie. My big thing was thinking, I was watching my mom watching it. I was like, 'God \u2026' because I'm so, I guess, not the glamorous version of myself \u2013 or even honestly my version. You know, I was a bit heavier and didn't see my skin person for a while, you know. I was like, 'God, it must be so interesting for my mom to see her middle-aged daughter on the screen.' She must have been like, 'Oh my God, she's middle-aged!'\"",
      "Still, it seems middle age has been good to Kate Hudson, even in a year that would put the gray in anyone's hair. Last January, a wind-driven firestorm incinerated the Pacific Palisades section of Los Angeles, where Hudson has lived for most of her life. Her home is one of the few still standing, but her neighborhood is full of vacant lots where her friends' houses used to be \u2013 and some of the places she treasured the most went up in smoke.",
      "She showed us around what was left of the neighborhood: \"Every time I drive by here, taking the kids from, like, baseball or soccer, you know, I drive by and I go, 'Oh, that's where mommy had her first kiss.' And now you're like \u2026 it's not there. And that's what I mean by, like, nothing lasts.\"",
      "But in the end, home is where you feel loved. For Hudson, it's still her community in Los Angeles. And for Jackman, it's his pub in Manhattan: \"I come in here, I get a lot of, 'Ah, Hughie, come over and have a beer, mate.' I said, 'Ah, I gotta go.' 'Ah, come on mate, don't be a ****. Let's go. Let's have a beer. Buy me a beer. You can afford it!' A lot of that.\"",
      "I asked, \"Can you show up someplace and kind of be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Oh yeah,\" he replied.",
      "\"You can show up here and be a regular dude?\"",
      "\"Yeah, except I just have to be prepared for them to make fun of me!\" Jackman said, \"which is a sign of affection!\"",
      "Jackman was prepping for a little Neil Diamond tribute at Old Mates later that night, and just like in the movie, Jackman and Hudson did what Neil Diamond himself would've done: raise the roof.",
      "Watch Hugh Jackman and Kate Hudson perform \"Sweet Caroline\" at Old Mates:",
      "One final note: Neil Diamond himself is not in the film, but Jackman says he loved it \u2013 and gave him the ultimate stamp of approval: \"He put his arm around me like that, and I sort of leant, and he just kissed me on the forehead. And he said, 'You did good, kid!'\"",

    "summary": "Known as a popular Hollywood director, Rob Reiner also had a lengthy record of political and civic activism, especially in California.",
    "story": [
      "Rob Reiner was known for decades as a Hollywood luminary, finding early success as a sitcom star before going on to become one of the most prominent directors in the industry. But he also dedicated much of his life to political activism, with a long record of backing Democratic Party campaigns nationwide and supporting landmark policies for LGBTQ rights and childhood development in his home state of California.",
      "In the wake of his death, that legacy is being remembered by some of the country's leading political figures.",
      "Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead Sunday in their Los Angeles home, and police said Monday that their son, Nick Reiner, 32, has been\u00a0arrested for murder.",
      "Former President Barack Obama said he and Michelle Obama were \"heartbroken\" by the news. Reiner, he wrote, displayed \"a deep belief in the goodness of people \u2014 and a lifelong commitment to putting that belief into action. Together, he and his wife lived lives defined by purpose. They will be remembered for the values they championed and the countless people they inspired,.\"",
      "Similar sentiments were shared by former Vice President Kamala Harris, who previously represented California in the U.S. Senate, and House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, both of whom referred to the Reiners as \"dear friends.\"",
      "\"Rob loved our country, cared deeply about the future of our nation, and fought for America's democracy,\" Harris\u00a0wrote on X.",
      "Pelosi's post highlighted Reiner's deep history of activism in California, referencing his efforts to help secure marriage equality and a program supporting early childhood development in the state.",
      "\"Personally, Rob cared deeply about people and demonstrated that in his civic activities \u2014 whether by supporting the First 5 initiative or fighting against Prop 8 in California,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that he was also \"a champion for the First Amendment and the creative rights of artists.\"",
      "Reiner led the campaign to pass California's First 5 initiative in 1998. Also known as the California Children and Families Initiative, it's \"dedicated to improving the lives of California's young children and their families through a comprehensive system of education, health services, childcare, and other crucial programs,\" according to its mission statement. Funding for the initiative comes from a statewide tax on tobacco. Reiner chaired the organization from 1999 to 2006.",
      "Later, Reiner joined the board of directors at the American Foundation for Equal Rights, a nonprofit organization that brought a crucial federal court challenge against Proposition 8, California's now-defunct 2008 ban on same-sex marriage. He and his wife were among the organization's founding board members, and Michele Reiner went on to serve as its treasurer. They were driving forces in its successful effort to pursue legal protection for marriage equality in California and several other states, before the Supreme Court finally upheld it nationwide.",
      "Reiner was also an environmental advocate. He founded an environmental campaign in the early 2000s to protect California's Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife preserve, and prevent it from becoming a site for real estate development, the Los Angeles Times reported.",
      "Reiner lent his support to the campaigns of numerous Democratic candidates, including Al Gore during the 2000 presidential election and Hillary Clinton's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton\u00a0said\u00a0in a post on X that Rob and Michele Reiner \"inspired and uplifted millions through their work on film and television. And they were good, generous people who made everyone who knew them better through their active citizenship in defense of inclusive democracy, setting an example for us all to follow. Hillary and I will always be grateful for their friendship, unfailing kindness, and support.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden praised the Reiners' \"extraordinary contributions\" and wrote, \"We take solace in knowing their work will live on for generations to come.\"",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom both shared their appreciation of Reiner's political achievements in their state. Newsom described Reiner as a \"big-hearted genius\" with \"boundless empathy,\" who \"made California a better place through his good works.\" Bass called Reiner's death \"is a devastating loss\" for Los Angeles and the nation.",
      "\"Rob Reiner's contributions reverberate throughout American culture and society, and he has improved countless lives through his creative work and advocacy fighting for social and economic justice,\" Bass wrote, adding that, as an activist, \"he always used his gifts in service of others.\"",
      "Reiner was also an outspoken critic of President Trump, which drew the ire of the president. In social media posts and comments at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump accused Reiner of \"Trump derangement syndrome\" and said, \"I wasn't a fan of his at all.\" The president's comments were condemned by a number of Republicans as well as Democrats.",

      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "He was the son of comedy royalty, but as he was growing up, Rob Reiner (March 6, 1947-Dec. 14, 2025) thought it was normal to be in a house with so much laughter, surrounded by some of the 20th century's greatest comic minds, from Mel Brooks and Woody Allen to Neil Simon: \"I was aware how funny things were, but I didn't think there was anything unusual about it,\" he told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2010, \"until I went over to my friend Paul Schindler's house, where I realized things weren't as funny over there. They were a little funnier at my house.\"",
      "His father, Carl, was a second banana to Sid Caesar, straight man to Brooks' \"2,000-Year-Old Man,\" and director of such films as \"The Jerk\" and \"All of Me.\" Rob continued in the family tradition, writing for \"The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour,\" before being cast in one of the most influential sitcoms ever, Norman Lear's \"All in the Family.\"",
      "Reiner starred as Michael Stivic, the outspoken liberal son-in-law of the bigoted conservative Archie Bunker, who bestowed upon him a memorable nickname: Meathead.",
      "\"I remember reading the script and thinking, this is such good writing, this is so edgy and so brilliant. There's no way that this is going to fly on American television,\" Reiner said. Actually, it went stratospheric, becoming the top-rated comedy and winning 22 Emmys (including two for Reiner) during its nine seasons.",
      "When the show ended its run, Reiner turned to directing, with \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" a \"mockumentary\" about England's loudest rock band. He followed with the romantic comedy \"The Sure Thing,\" the coming-of-age story \"Stand by Me\" (a Stephen King adaptation), and the fairy tale-like \"The Princess Bride.\"",
      "In 1989's \"When Harry Met Sally,\" Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play friends who eventually realize they are right for each other \u2014 but not until after Ryan's Sally demonstrates, in a restaurant, how to fake an orgasm. In a cameo, Reiner's mom, Estelle, gave the scene its peerless punchline: \"I'll have what she's having.\"",
      "\"I basically tell the same love story over and over,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"Essentially what it is, the girl in the story is always much more emotionally mature. The boy is always running around like an idiot trying to catch up, trying to figure out what's going on. \u2026 I mean, that's my story. I mean, basically, you know, my wife made me a person.\"",
      "He directed Kathy Bates to a best actress Oscar in \"Misery,\" and earned a best picture nomination for \"A Few Good Men.\" His other films included \"The American President,\" \"Ghosts of Mississippi,\" \"Rumor Has It\u2026,\" \"The Bucket List,\" \"And So It Goes,\" \"LBJ,\" and \"Albert Brooks: Defending My Life,\" a documentary about comedian and childhood friend Albert Brooks.",
      "Meanwhile, his production company, Castle Rock, was behind such films and TV programs as \"City Slickers,\" \"Honeymoon in Vegas,\" \"Mr. Saturday Night,\" \"In the Line of Fire,\" \"Malice,\" \"The Shawshank Redemption,\" \"Dolores Claiborne,\" \"Before Sunrise,\" \"Lone Star,\" \"Waiting for Guffman,\" \"The Green Mile,\" \"Michael Clayton,\" and \"Seinfeld.\"",
      "\"I make movies about people that live on Earth,\" Reiner told \"Sunday Morning.\" \u00a0\"Nobody gets exploded, nobody is running around chasing anything. Basically, they're people in rooms talking.\"",
      "An activist and vocal proponent for progressive causes, Reiner supported early childhood education and legalizing same-sex marriage, and raised funds for Democratic candidates.",
      "But he may be best remembered as \"Meathead.\" \"On almost a daily basis somebody will call me that,\" he said. \"I love that, because \u2014 you know, I've such a great experience with the show. I'm so proud of it and I have often said no matter what I do in life, I could win the Nobel Prize, the headline would read, 'Meathead wins the Nobel.'\""

      "Netflix leaders doubled down Monday on their intention to acquire part of Warner Bros. Discovery, while also looking to alleviate concerns in Hollywood about the blockbuster deal's potential impact on the movie business.",
      "In a regulatory filing, Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos pledged that the streaming giant would continue to release movies to theaters.",
      "\"We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix,\" the pair said in a letter addressed to Netflix employees, highlighting the company's strategic pivot. \"When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\"",
      "\"We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production,\" they added.",
      "Peters and Sarandos also expressed optimism that Netflix's proposed $83 billion purchase of Warner Bros. Discovery's TV and film assets will win government regulatory approval. Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",

    "story": [
      "An urgent advisory warning people against eating foraged mushrooms was issued by the California Department of Public Health on Friday due to recent amatoxin poisonings.",
      "As of Friday, there were 21 poisonings confirmed by the California Poison Control System linked to eating wild, foraged mushrooms, such as death caps, the CDPH said.",
      "One case resulted in death, and several other patients, including children and adults, have suffered severe liver damage, the CDPH said. A liver transplant may even be needed for at least one of the patients.",
      "The CDPH said the poisonings were reported in clusters in the Monterey area and Bay Area. However, the risk of poisoning is statewide as rain during the fall and winter months creates beneficial growth conditions for death caps.",
      "They can typically be found near oaks and other hardwood trees, including pine trees, and are easily mistaken for safe, edible mushrooms. But neither cooking, boiling, drying or freezing them will render them safe to eat, the CDPH said.",
      "Symptoms such as watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and dehydration can begin between six to 24 hours after eating one, and it's possible symptoms will go away after a day, but the CDPH warns the recovery is \"deceptive.\"",
      "\"Patients may still develop serious to fatal liver damage within 48 to 96 hours after eating the mushrooms,\" the CDPH said.",
      "\"Because the death cap can easily be mistaken for edible safe mushrooms, we advise the public not to forage for wild mushrooms at all during this high-risk season,\" said Dr. Erica Pan, CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer.",
      "The CDPH advises people to buy mushrooms from reputable stores or known commercial sources.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 19:30:35 -0500",
    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

    "story": [
      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that 10 of its retail partners are testing that approach to pricing, describing such practices as a standard way stores assess customer preferences.",

      "Mr. Trump, who announced the plan in a White House address billed as focusing on affordability, said the amount was inspired by the year of the nation's founding.",
      "The money is \"to both thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation,\" the White House said in a statement Thursday.",

      "Is it a recurring bonus?",

      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",
      "Active duty service members who fell under the pay grades of O-6 or below as of Nov. 30 are eligible for the checks. Reserve component service members on active duty orders of 31 days as of that same date also qualify for the payments, according to the White House.",

      "Shirley Modlin, who owns 3D Design and Manufacturing in Powhatan, Virginia, told CBS News that rising operational expenses are making it tough for her to offer raises and health insurance for her 10 workers.",
      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Wall Street analysts expect another strong year in stocks in 2026, propelled by continued AI sector gains and additional Fed interest-rate cuts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. stock market scaled new heights in 2025, as investors largely tuned out concerns about the Trump administration's sharply higher tariffs and shrugged off fears of a financial market bubble among artificial intelligence companies.",
      "The S&P 500 stock index is up roughly 15% this year through Dec. 17\u2014 a strong performance, although lower than the heady 23% jump posted by the broad-based index in 2024. The S&P 500 has climbed an average of 13% per year over the last decade, according to Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at wealth management firm Janney Montgomery Scott.",
      "The Nasdaq Composite, which includes tech heavy-hitters such as Alphabet, Microsoft and Nvidia, has climbed more than 18% this year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average is up more than 13%.",
      "The key question: Will such investor exuberance spill over into 2026, especially as concerns about an\u00a0AI bubble\u00a0percolate?",
      "\"I think conditions remain relatively fertile for stock prices to do OK overall,\" Luschini told CBS News. \"The big risk is that the whole AI narrative starts to lose a little of its viscosity.\"",
      "Other forecasters are also expecting a strong stock market performance in 2026. David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, expects the S&P 500, which closed Monday trading at 6,816 points, to reach 7,300 points by June of next year and 7,700 by the end of 2026. That would represent a roughly 15% gain over the next year.",
      "J.P. Morgan said in a November research report that it expects the S&P 500 to rise 13% to 15% next year, boosted by robust corporate earnings growth, and to carry that strength into 2027.",
      "What will drive stocks in 2026?",
      "Several catalysts are expected to drive the stock market in 2026. Among them is another year of strong corporate earnings, particularly in tech, analysts say. BofA Global Research expects overall earnings to grow in the mid-double digits next year.",
      "\"Multiple expansion and earnings growth both pushed the S&P 500 up 15% this year,\" the securities firm said in a market forecast. \"In 2026, earnings will do the lift.\"",
      "The AI boom should also help fuel the stock market, with a wave of capital investments likely to drive up tech stocks, analysts note. AI capital expenditures from major tech companies including Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft and Oracle are expected to approach $520 billion in 2026, Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial, said in a research note.",
      "Another area expected to benefit from the AI boom is the industrials sector, which is supplying the equipment necessary for data centers.",
      "Growth, however, won't be limited to tech or AI-adjacent sectors. Indeed, Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment and options analyst at eToro, said a broadening of the bull market could be in the cards, with all 11 sectors in the S&P 500 expected to rise next year.",
      "\"If it happens, it'll have been five years since we've seen it,\" he said.",
      "Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge, and Luschini both expect a good year for financial services stocks. Banks have traded very well this year amid an easier regulatory backdrop and a jump in mergers and acquisitions.",
      "Another tailwind for the stock market could be softer monetary policy and a more dovish Federal Reserve, Kenwell said, with President Trump soon expected to nominate a new central bank chief before Jerome Powell's term ends in May.",
      "\"It's kind of a when, not if, rate-cut situation with the Fed,\" Kenwell said.",
      "Still, analysts and major banks expect a slowdown in the pace of interest rate cuts. In a November report, J.P. Morgan forecasts one more interest rate cut in January before an extended pause and said that if the central bank further eases monetary policy, the S&P 500 could surpass 8,000 points in 2026.",
      "Is my money safe?",
      "The biggest shadow looming over the stock market next year is what will happen with artificial intelligence.",
      "AI and tech stocks have been the propelling force behind equity gains this year, with\u00a0earnings growth\u00a0from the \"Magnificent Seven\" far outpacing other companies in the S&P 500. That strength has been accompanied by a boom in capital expenditures, as investors rush to invest in data center construction and other technology infrastructure to meet rising demand for AI.",
      "\"Robust demand for cloud services and data center capacity shows no signs of slowing,\" Janus Henderson portfolio manager Jeremiah Buckley said in his company's 2026 outlook on capital investment.",
      "Amid all the hype, some investors are concerned about whether AI's ascendance could start to falter next year, leading to a market correction or the bursting of what some consider to be an AI bubble.",
      "In its 2026 outlook, Vanguard said it expects U.S. technology stocks to maintain momentum given the rate of investment and anticipated earnings growth. At the same time, the investment management company noted that \"risks are growing\" amid all of the AI optimism.",
      "Crisafulli said tech gains have historically moved in unison, but that started to splinter in November, when Alphabet shares surged 14% following the release of Google Gemini 3, while the rest of the Nasdaq slumped. The continued fracturing of the AI narrative is one of the headwinds he expects investors will have to face in 2026.",
      "\"It's not so much the bubbles bursting,\" he said. \"It's more just people looking at it in a more nuanced way.\"",
      "Still, as usual investors should expect some turbulence. Minor pullbacks or flat trading periods are possible, especially after several months of consecutive growth in the S&P 500, according to Kenwell.",
      "\"When we look at 2025, it was a good reminder that volatility is in play, and that's something that certainly can be back in the cards in 2026,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 11:05:29 -0500",
    "summary": "Shoppers may be unaware they're paying as much as 23% more than others for the same grocery items on Instacart, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "Instacart customers may be surprised to discover they are unwittingly paying more for the same items sold by some of America's major retail chains than their fellow shoppers.",
      "A months-long investigation by the nonprofit organizations Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative found that identical grocery items on Instacart could differ in price by as much as 23% from one customer to the next.",
      "That's due to the platform's algorithmic pricing experiments, which place different price tags on identical products without revealing the discrepancies directly to shoppers, the report found. The AI model, which Instacart started implementing in 2022, sets grocery prices at some large retail chains that partner with the San Francisco-based delivery company, the groups added.",
      "Variations in pricing for identical products are particularly acute in online shopping, given that customers don't have the same reference points as in physical stores, said Neil Saunders, managing director and analyst at GlobalData.",
      "\"You sit in front of your phone or your browser, you're shown the price, and you don't know what everyone else was shown,\" he said.",
      "Justin Brookman, director of digital marketplace policy for Consumer Reports, agreed. \"Traditionally, we haven't had to worry about this sort of thing. We would go to the supermarket and pay what was on the shelf,\" he told CBS News. \"Now, I think people are going to be worried: Am I getting ripped off?\"",
      "Instacart's AI-driven pricing technology has caught the attention of the Federal Trade Commission, which is now probing the company over its use of the tool, according to\u00a0Reuters.",
      "\"The Federal Trade Commission has a longstanding policy of not commenting on any potential or ongoing investigations,\" \u00a0the FTC said in a statement. \"But, like so many Americans, we are disturbed by what we have read in the press about Instacart's alleged pricing practices.\"",
      "Report finds major price discrepancies",
      "Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative based their findings on data gathered from online shopping sessions, in which hundreds of volunteers shopped on Instacart for identical baskets of goods from Safeway and Target.",
      "Of the 437 participants, every single one was exposed to algorithmic price experiments, according to the report. The investigation also found evidence of price experimentation at Albertsons, Costco, Kroger and Sprouts Farmers Market.",
      "According to Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, Instacart has framed price differences between customers as \"negligible.\" However, the scope of the price experiments is \"far broader and more costly to some consumers than has been publicly acknowledged,\" the organizations said in the report.",
      "The investigation found that some products had as many as five different price points, with variations ranging from as little as 7 cents to $2.56 per item. During one test conducted for a Safeway in Seattle, the price for a box of Wheat Thins differed by as much as 23%.",
      "All told, the price variations could cost families $1,200 a year, based on how much Instacart says the typical household of four spends on groceries, the report found.",
      "Some products were unscathed by the price experiments. For example, at the Seattle Safeway, volunteers did not observe any price variations for items such as Premium brand saltine crackers, Heinz ketchup and Barilla farfalle pasta.",
      "Safeway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Instacart told CBS News in a statement that 10 of its retailer partners are using pricing experiments, but did not specify which ones.",
      "\"Just as retailers have long tested prices in their physical stores to better understand consumer preferences, a subset of only 10 retail partners \u2014 ones that already apply markups \u2014 do the same online via Instacart,\" a spokesperson said in an email. \"These limited, short-term and randomized tests help retail partners learn what matters most to consumers and how to keep essential items affordable.\"",
      "Customers were also shown different \"original\" prices, making some savings appear larger, the report found, a concept known as \"fictitious pricing.\"\u00a0Amazon was sued this October\u00a0for allegedly using this tactic during its summer Prime Day sale.",
      "The rise of AI pricing models",
      "Dynamic pricing, which sets consumer prices based on demand, has long been part of the e-commerce landscape. However, while it's a common tactic in certain industries like travel, where supply is fixed, consumers may be surprised to see it cropping up in the grocery space, Saunders said.",
      "\"In retail, especially grocery retail, people expect the price to be the price,\" he said. \"They don't expect [it] to yo-yo up and down.\"",
      "Another issue, as the report points out, is that consumers often have no clue that they may be paying more for the same item. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u00a0Act prevents \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices,\" including \"misleading cost or price claims.\" However, Saunders said he doesn't believe companies are legally obligated to tell customers that they are part of pricing experiments.",
      "\"Instacart shoppers we spoke to say they were unaware that they were participants in active Instacart pricing experiments and view the practice as manipulative and unfair,\" the report says.",
      "One example of dynamic pricing is surveillance pricing, a tactic employed by companies that involves using a shopper's behavior and personal data to make price evaluations, according to the FTC. Saunders said surveillance pricing has been supercharged by artificial intelligence, which can assess vast amounts of data at rapid speeds to determine price levels.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that it does not use personal, demographic or user-level behavioral data to set prices.",
      "As pricing models like Instacart's become more sophisticated, Brookman said he's concerned about what it could mean for consumers.",
      "\"I'm worried companies are going to use these sorts of algorithmic pricing models to charge us the maximum amount we're willing to pay, which is good for their profits, but not so good for [our wallets],\" he said.",

      "Trump Media & Technology is merging with fusion energy company TAE Technologies in a deal worth more than $6 billion, aiming to harness the fledgling technology to power energy-hungry artificial intelligence data centers.",
      "TAE, which is privately owned, is developing technology aimed at producing energy by fusing atomic nuclei. Trump Media & Technology owns President Donald Trump's Truth Social platform.",
      "The merger comes amid a difficult year for Trump Media shares, which trade under the ticker DJT \u2014 the same as Mr. Trump's initials. Through Wednesday, the stock was down 69% for the year, even as the S&P 500 had gained 14%.",
      "After the merger was announced Thursday morning, Trump Media shares jumped $3.37, or 32%, to $13.84.",
      "Trump Media's strategic shift",
      "For Trump Media, the merger represents another strategic shift, given its 2021 launch as a business focusing on the conservative-leaning social media space.",
      "More recently, the company has pivoted beyond its roots as a tech business. Earlier this year, Trump Media struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency, and it has also rolled out investment funds with \"America-first\" strategies.",
      "The merger with TAE represents a continuation of Trump Media's \"America first\" principles, former California lawmaker Devin Nunes, now chief executive of Trump Media, said in a Thursday conference call with investors.",
      "\"Fusion power will lower energy prices, bolster our national defense and secure the energy needed to guarantee America's dominance of AI technology,\" Nunes said on the call.",
      "He added, \"This combination positions the combined company to help lead the global AI revolution and kickstart an American energy renaissance.\"",
      "After the merger closes next year, the company will \"quickly seek approvals to site and build the company's first utility-scale power plant,\" Nunes said. \"We expect siting to commence by year-end 2026, sending us on the path to build future plants expected to be 350 megawatt to 500 megawatt.\"",
      "AI power needs",
      "With tech companies building AI data centers across the U.S., their need for power is \"growing exponentially,\" according to a report earlier this year from Deloitte. Power demand for AI data centers could grow more than thirtyfold by 2035, up to 123 gigawatts from 4 gigawatts last year, the consulting firm noted.",
      "The combination represents \"a major play on creating the first public nuclear fusion company in the U.S.,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a report. TAE's investors include Google, Chevron and Goldman Sachs, he noted.",
      "TAE has \"safely built and operated five fusion reactors and importantly proven major energy and fusion breakthroughs over the years... putting TAE at the top of the mountain in the fusion global scene in our view,\" Ives said.",

      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 3% on an annual basis last month, according to economists surveyed by financial data firm FactSet. In the most recent inflation reading, from September, the CPI rate rose 3% on an annual basis.",
      "November's cooler inflation data comes after prices had inched higher throughout much of the year, with economists pointing to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs.",

      "Thursday's report provides the first glimpse of recent inflation data since late October, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics released September CPI data.",

      "Wall Street analysts cautioned that the November inflation figures may be distorted by the government shutdown, which disrupted data collection. The December CPI report should offer a clearer signal of whether the latest reading is a one-off or evidence that price pressures are truly easing, said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's possible that this does reflect a genuine drop off in inflationary pressures, but such a sudden stop, particularly in the more-persistent services components like rent or shelter is very unusual, at least outside of a recession,\" he said in a research note.",
      "Bernard Yaros, lead economist at Oxford Economics, also said some \"caution is warranted\" in interpreting the November inflation data, given the housing component was unusually weak in the prior two months.",
      "Some analysts said the softer-than-expected inflation reading paves the way for an interest rate cut in January. That helped boost the three major stock indices, which all traded higher Thursday morning after the release of the CPI data. Interest rate traders now place the likelihood of a January rate cut at around 27%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.",
      "However, given gaps in the data, the Fed may put more weight on the December CPI release, which will be issued before the central bank's next interest rate decision in January, according to Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions in Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The Fed will instead focus on the December CPI released in mid-January, just two weeks before its next meeting, as a more accurate bellwether for inflation,\" he said in an email.",
      "What it means for Americans' wallets",
      "Food prices are cooling, although certain grocery items remain expensive. Coffee has climbed 18.8% from a year ago, and ground beef has risen 14.9%.",
      "Some retailers have gradually passed along the costs of the Trump administration's tariffs to consumers, fueling concerns about higher prices. Still, tariff-driven inflation has been milder than many feared, Garrett Melson, a portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said in an email ahead of the CPI release.",
      "In some cases, companies have absorbed the added costs rather than raising prices, while others stockpiled goods ahead of the tariffs, helping blunt price increases.",
      "In November, President Trump cut tariffs on a slate of products that the U.S. typically imports, including bananas and coffee, as his administration sought to address consumer frustrations over\u00a0affordability.",
      "While inflation is expected to ease next year, Americans could continue to face cost pressures, said Gregory Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon.",
      "\"I don't think Americans should brace for surging inflation, but I do think there is a growing risk of a persistent affordability crisis,\" he told CBS News earlier this month. \"Given prices are rising at a faster clip than they normally would, and income trends are slowing.\"",

    "summary": "Negative views of the nation's economy persist as 2025 draws to a close.",
    "story": [
      "Many Americans are feeling the pinch this holiday season.",
      "Most feel it's at least somewhat difficult to afford the things they're buying for the holidays. Some are pulling back on gifts, entertainment and travel, particularly those among the majority who say items cost more now than they did last year.",
      "Holiday spending also spotlights the long-standing differences in Americans' financial situations. Those who report their financial situation as good, who tend to have higher incomes, say affording the holidays is easier. But even they say things are costing more.",
      "In all, the season often brings feelings of gratitude and happiness, but finances can factor into sentiments, too: those who say it is hard to afford things are more apt to say the season also brings stress.",
      "With holiday travel coming, many do feel they're getting relief on gas prices. More say they are going down more than going up \u2014 the first time we've seen that this year.",
      "Relatively few Americans say they will be buying more gifts, entertainment or airline tickets or food and drinks this holiday season, compared to recent years. Those who say it will be difficult to afford items this year are especially likely to say they will be scaling back on these things.",
      "The people who are keeping purchases steady or buying more this year tend to be those who say their financial situation is good.",
      "Feelings about the holiday season",
      "Overall, the holiday season evokes more positive feelings than negative ones, with many saying they are happy and grateful.",
      "But those who are having difficulty affording holiday expenses are especially likely to report feeling stressed, too.",
      "Looking back on 2025",
      "Views of the economy have been low for years, and 2025 continued that trend. But beneath those sentiments, the year also showed a consistent split between those who feel their finances are good and bad \u2014 the former generally having higher incomes and saying the stock market matters to their finances, the latter having lower incomes and being more impacted by prices and inflation.",
      "On personal finances, about half of the country continues to say their financial situation is good, while about half say it is bad, which has been the case throughout the year.",
      "Looking back, overall, for those whose financial situation changed over the year, more said it got worse rather than better.\u00a0 But those who did feel their situation improved were also more likely to be those with higher incomes.",
      "The year ends with most Americans voicing larger concerns about inflation that have persisted for years. Throughout 2025, about three-quarters said their incomes were not keeping pace with inflation. Views of the overall economy remain low.",
      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",
      "Among the bright spots, on balance, more Americans rate the condition of the stock market as good than rate it as bad, and that's particularly so among those for whom the market's performance matters a lot to their finances.",
      "More Americans now say the price of gas in their area is coming down than say it's going up \u2014 a reversal from what we saw this fall and over the year.",
      "Throughout the year, like today, Americans have had a collectively mixed outlook looking forward. Just over half of Americans expect a slowing economy or one in recession. While others expect a growing economy or one that holds steady.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,267 U.S. adults interviewed between December 15-17, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote.

    "summary": "Warner Bros. Discovery's board told its shareholders that Paramount Skydance's offer \"provides inadequate value\" for the business.",
    "story": [
      "Warner Bros. Discovery on Wednesday urged shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, arguing that it created \"significant risks and costs\" for the company and that Netflix's prior offer provides better value.",
      "The move follows competing bids for Warner Bros. Discovery, whose storied film library includes classics like \"Casablanca\" and the \"Harry Potter\" film series. Netflix agreed on December 5 to buy a part of Warner Bros. in a deal valued at $82.7 billion, while Paramount Skydance followed on December 8 with an all-cash offer for the entirety of the media conglomerate.",
      "In making the bid for all of Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison described it as a \"superior all-cash offer.\" Ellison said that its bid, combining the assets of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount Skydance (the parent of CBS News), would face an easier path through the government regulatory process.",
      "Paramount is offering $30 a share for the entire company, while Netflix agreed to buy Warner Bros.'s HBO as well as its streaming and studios business, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 a share.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's stock traded on Wednesday at $28.30 a share.",
      "Paramount Skydance on Wednesday said that it is sticking with its $30 per share offer, expressing confidence that the bid offers \"superior value\" to Netflix's bid.",
      "Paramount Skydance added that it believes a merger with Warner Bros. Discovery provides \"a faster, more certain path to completion than the Netflix transaction.\"",
      "\"I have been encouraged by the feedback we have received from WBD shareholders, who clearly understand the benefits of our offer,\" Ellison said in a statement. \"We will continue to move forward to deliver this transaction, which is in the best interest of WBD shareholders, consumers and the creative industries.\"",
      "Why Warner Bros. Discovery prefers Netflix",
      "In recommending that shareholders reject Paramount Skydance's bid, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board concluded the two offers pose an equal regulatory risk. Warner Bros. Discovery also said its analysis found that Netflix's offer, which includes cash and Netflix stock, is superior.",
      "It also raised concerns about Paramount Skydance's $40.65 billion equity commitment, for which Warner Bros. Discovery said \"there is no Ellison family commitment of any kind.\" David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person, with a net worth of $243 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery's recommendation comes shortly after one of Paramount Skydance's financial partners in the deal, Affinity Partners, said it had dropped out of the hostile bid. Affinity is the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.",
      "An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that, while it continued to believe in the \"strong strategic rationale\" for Paramount Skydance's offer, it had decided to pull back because \"the dynamics of the investment have changed significantly since we initially became involved in October.\"",
      "In a letter sent to shareholders, Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it believed Netflix's finances are also in better shape, with a stronger credit rating and a larger market capitalization.",
      "\"The Netflix merger is fully backed by a public company with a market cap in excess of $400 billion with an investment grade balance sheet,\" the letter stated.",
      "Paramount Skydance's credit rating is \"at or only a notch above 'junk' status from the two leading rating agencies,\" while its market valuation stands at $15 billion, Warner Bros. Discovery added.",
      "Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concern about Paramount Skydance's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its offer.",
      "\"The assets and liabilities of the trust are not publicly disclosed and are subject to change,\" its shareholder letter stated. \"As the name indicates, revocable trusts typically have provisions allowing for assets to be moved at any time.\"",
      "While Wednesday's letter to shareholders means Paramount's is not the offer favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide to tender their shares in favor of Paramount's offer for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery and TNT.",

    "summary": "Americans lose hundreds of millions of dollars each year in travel-related fraud, according to the Joint Economic Committee. Here's how to avoid getting burned.",
    "story": [
      "Lawmakers are warning travelers to beware of a range of scams that tend to proliferate during the holiday season, including phishing schemes involving phony websites, as well as criminals who impersonate airlines and hotels.",
      "Online travel fraud has surged, accounting for $1 trillion in global financial losses in 2024, according to the Joint Economic Committee (JEC), which issued the warning on Wednesday. For example, such scams can lead to consumers paying for fake trips or booking accommodations that look nothing like how they are pictured online.",
      "\"While the winter holidays are one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, they're also one of the busiest seasons for scammers impersonating airlines, hotels and rental platforms,\" U.S. Senator Maggie Hassan, the panel's ranking member, said in a statement. \"As millions of Americans prepare to travel to see their loved ones over the next few weeks, everyone should also prepare to protect themselves against rampant travel scams.\"",
      "The JEC, a bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers that advises Congress on economic issues, also called on the Federal Trade Commission to indicate what steps it is taking alongside U.S. technology companies to protect consumers from overseas scam networks. Organized foreign criminals stole $10 billion from Americans in 2024, up 66% from the prior year.",
      "In a letter, the panel pressed the FTC to detail how it is working with social media sites, dating platforms, financial technology companies and other actors to disrupt travel fraud. Lawmakers also requested details on how much money the FTC has allocated to protect Americans from overseas fraud.",
      "The panel's Democratic minority cited data from travel and payment firms showing a sharp rise in online fraud around the holidays.",
      "Travel fraud is among the most common types of criminal activity, according to the\u00a0FTC, which said it accounted for $274 million in U.S. consumer losses in 2024. Research from the Mastercard Economics Institute has found that\u00a0fraud spikes by up to 28%\u00a0during peak travel seasons.",
      "Common travel scams",
      "Criminals employ a range of tactics to extract payment details or other personal information from travelers. One common ploy is to send a text message claiming that a person's flight has been canceled, according to the JEC.",
      "\"These texts, which appear to come from major airlines, direct customers to a fake number or link to rebook their travel,\" warned the panel, which advises people to verify any schedule changes with their airline.",
      "Scammers may also pose as legitimate business representatives in replying to travelers' social media posts about flight delays or other travel headaches. In addition, fraudsters are known to pay to appear in online search results, advertising phony customer service numbers that lead directly to a scammer.",
      "How to avoid getting burned",
      "The JEC advised travelers always to consult official company websites or apps when seeking information, and not to click on links sent by text or email directing them to a website. Consumers should also be leery of online ads, sponsored search results or links posted on social media, the lawmakers warned.",
      "If a travel company is unfamiliar, meanwhile, the panel advises travelers to check sites like the Better Business Bureau, where other customers can post reviews and complaints. Clues indicating a possible scam include misspelled or extra words in a website address.",
      "Consumers should also beware vendors that describe accommodations as luxurious, but don't provide details such as a hotel's name or location, the JEC said. If a company does not list its cancellation or refund policy, or requests payment in cryptocurrency, that could also be suspicious, according to the committee.",

    "story": [
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Wednesday unveiled the new website for the Trump Accounts program, a tax-deferred investment vehicle for American children. He also announced a new Trump Accounts partner, billionaire hedge fund manager Ray Dalio.",
      "At a briefing on the program, Bessent projected that the $1,000 deposited into a Trump Account by the government when a child is born would grow to over $600,000 by retirement age, assuming that the historic growth rate continues. For families who invest $5,000 each year in the accounts, that sum would grow to $1 million, he added.",
      "Parents may sign up their children by making an election on a new IRS form \u2014 Form 4547 \u2014 when they file their taxes. A financial institution will receive the child's funds and activate the account. Trump accounts are to be invested in an authorized investment, like mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 stock index or another index with mostly U.S. equities. Financial firms managing the funds also may not charge more than 0.1% in annual fees.",
      "Children who are U.S. citizens born between Jan. 1, 2025, and Dec. 31, 2028 are eligible to receive the $1,000 government contribution into their accounts. Children under 18 who have a Social Security number can receive up to $5,000 each year from parents, guardians or others in their account.",
      "Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is contributing $75 million as part of a 50-state push for businesses and philanthropic organizations to donate in each state. Dalio will \"boost funding for Trump accounts for kids across Connecticut,\" Bessent said.",
      "\"Ray and Barbara Dalio through Dalio Philanthropies announced today that they are joining the Dell family in seeding the new Trump Administration investment accounts with an additional $250 per child for approximately 300,000 children in Connecticut,\" the Dalios said in a statement on their foundation's website.",

      "A robocall scam is targeting hundreds of thousands of consumers each week, with fraudsters impersonating employees of Walmart in an effort to obtain people's personal information, according to a telecommunications security company and the Federal Communications Commission.",
      "Targets of the scheme receive a call from someone claiming to be from Walmart asking if they have authorized the purchase of a PlayStation 5 video game console and accompanying 3D headset. The person is then invited to \"cancel\" the order by connecting with a live customer service representative, who asks for credit card, Social Security number and other personal data.",
      "YouMail, which makes technology to block robocalls and scam texts, has been tracking calls associated with the so-called phishing campaign in cooperation with the FCC.",
      "\"It's too easy to get tricked when you feel pressure to act right away to address a problem that might cost you money,\" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told CBS News in an email, noting that the scam targets tens of millions of U.S. consumers.",

      "\"Hi, this is [NAME] from Walmart, and this is not a telemarketing call. We have detected a pre-authorized purchase of $919.45 for a PlayStation 5 and 3D headset, recently placed through a Walmart account registered to your name and phone number. If you did not authorize this purchase, press 1 to speak with a Walmart representative immediately.\"",
      "According to YouMail data, the bad actors have used more than 50 aliases as part of the ongoing robocall scam. They relied mainly on male names like David, Brandon, Michael and Paul earlier in the campaign, before swapping them for more female aliases in the second half of this year, such as Olivia, Jessica and Naomi.",
      "The scam first surfaced as early as 2023, and Quilici said it has expanded since then. \"Most campaigns start at low volume before they ramp,\" he said.",

      "The scammers are targeting Walmart because it is a trusted brand with a huge customer base, according to Iskander Sanchez-Rola, director of AI and innovation for Norton, a cybersecurity company.",
      "\"Walmart shoppers may also be more vulnerable, since many are budget-conscious and quick to react to unexpected charges, especially when the scam uses realistic AI-generated voices that sound similar to the automated calls they already receive from the retailer,\" he said in an email to CBS News.",

      "Employers across the U.S. added 64,000 jobs in November, beating economists' forecasts, new government data\u00a0shows, even as new October figures revealed a loss of 105,000 jobs, a sign the labor market remains under pressure.",
      "The unemployment rate in November rose to 4.6%, the highest level since September 2021.",
      "The November employment report offers a fresh picture of the labor market after a six-week blackout in official data caused by the recent\u00a0government shutdown. The data suggests that employers in industries ranging from manufacturing to hospitality are hitting the pause button on hiring amid concerns about economic growth and tariff costs, some economists noted.",
      "\"Businesses are not hiring as they adjust to tariffs, uncertain conditions and AI. The result is about 700,000 more unemployed Americans than there were a year ago,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email.",
      "By the numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 40,000 jobs in November, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The Labor Department on Tuesday also released partial employment data from October, which shows a loss of 105,000 jobs that month.",
      "The drag on October employment was driven by a steep loss in the federal workforce, which shed 162,000 jobs that month. The decline is due to a wave of deferred resignations starting to show up in the payroll data, according to Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.",
      "Job growth for August and September was also revised down by a collective 33,000.",
      "The government's official employment data for October and November had been delayed due to the 43-day government shutdown, which ended in last month.",
      "In the absence of federal data, economists at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street had been monitoring alternative sources, which have signaled ongoing headwinds in the labor market. For instance, ADP earlier this month said private-sector employers in the U.S. cut 32,000 jobs in November, while outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas has tracked more than 1.1 million layoffs so far this year.",
      "Economic uncertainty has led workers to stay put and employers to pull back on hiring, creating a difficult situation for job seekers, especially those early in their careers.",
      "The labor market is slowly cooling, Federal Reserve Bank of New York president John C. Williams said in a\u00a0speech\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"I should emphasize that this has been an ongoing, gradual process, without signs of a sharp rise in layoffs or other indications of rapid deterioration,\" Williams said. But, he added, \"Job growth has been anemic.\"",
      "What it means",
      "The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.6% in November \u2014 the highest since September 2021 \u2014 as more people entered the labor force to look for jobs, according to Adam Crisafulli, head of Vital Knowledge.",
      "While the numbers offer a glimpse into the labor market during the government shutdown, experts say investors and government officials will likely view the data with some skepticism, given questions about the accuracy and completeness of data collection following the shutdown.",
      "Indeed, the Federal Reserve may not place much emphasis on the November numbers at its January rate-setting meeting because of the data disruption, said Kay Haigh, global co-head of fixed income and liquidity solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.",
      "\"The report on December's employment data, released in early January ahead of the next meeting, will likely be a much more meaningful indicator for the Fed when it comes to deciding the near-term policy trajectory,\" he said in an email.",
      "Earlier this month, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0said the central bank would likely view the October and November data with a \"somewhat skeptical eye,\" given the data may be distorted.",
      "The larger-than-expected rise in the unemployment rate could, however, raise concerns within the Fed, said Seema Shah, chief global strategist of Principal Asset Management, in an email.",
      "The central bank\u00a0lowered interest rates\u00a0by 0.25 percentage points for the third consecutive time last week,\u00a0citing\u00a0the rise in the downside risks to employment.",

    "summary": "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads, which would create the first U.S. transcontinental railroad, has lost the support of two major unions.",
    "story": [
      "The proposed $85 billion merger of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern railroads has lost the support of two of their biggest unions that represent more than half their workers because they're worried the deal would increase safety risks, lead to higher shipping rates and consumer prices and cause significant disruptions.",
      "The unions' decision, which they plan to announce Wednesday, will make the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division two of the most prominent critics of the deal to create the nation's first transcontinental railroad. They join the American Chemistry Council, an assortment of agricultural groups, and competing railroad BNSF in raising concerns that this combination would hurt competition.",
      "But the deal has picked up the support of the nation's largest rail union that represents conductors and hundreds of individual shippers as well as an Oval Office endorsement from President Trump.",
      "The U.S. Surface Transportation Board will begin weighing the opinions of all those stakeholders to determine whether the merger is in the public interest once the railroads file their formal application, which is expected later this week.",
      "Unions finding fault",
      "Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena has argued that creating a railroad that stretches from coast to coast would be good for the economy because it would be able to deliver shipments more quickly without handing them off between railroads in the middle of the country and that it could better compete against trucking. But the presidents of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division unions \u2014 which are both affiliated with the Teamsters \u2014 said that after months of meetings with Vena and other executives, they have serious doubts about the potential benefits, and they said the promises Vena made to preserve jobs of all current employees aren't detailed enough to be counted on.",
      "\"This proposed monopoly will end up costing businesses more and those costs will be passed on to consumers,\" Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen National President Mark Wallace said. \"We believe this transcontinental railroad will make shipping by rail less attractive as the merged carrier passes off rail lines that serve small towns, factories and farms to short line railroads while running miles-long slow-moving trains on the main line. For rail customers it will be a choice between 'Hell or the highway.'\"",
      "The unions say they're worried that safety could deteriorate after a merger because Norfolk Southern has made some strides in the two and a half years since the disastrous East Palestine, Ohio, derailment.",
      "Vena and Norfolk Southern CEO Mark George have said they're optimistic the merger will get approved because they believe it will be good for the country, their customers and rail workers. Over 99% of shareholders of both lines voted in favor of the combination last month.",
      "The Surface Transportation Board plans to review the deal under the tough new standard it adopted in 2001 after a series of disastrous rail mergers in the 1990s that led to delays of weeks or even months for some shipments. These untested rules require any merger of the six largest railroads to be in the public interest and show that it will enhance competition. When the Surface Transportation Board approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades two years ago, it used a less stringent standard allowing Canadian Pacific's $31 billion acquisition of Kansas City Southern.",
      "Outside views mixed",
      "Transportation expert and DePaul University Professor Joe Schwieterman said many people have been raising concerns about the Union Pacific merger because of its scope and the likelihood that it could trigger another merger and leave companies with only two American railroads to deal with. But everyone wants to examine the details in the merger application closely, he said.",
      "Currently, Norfolk Southern and CSX serve the eastern U.S. while Union Pacific and BNSF serve the west, and the two major Canadian rails compete where they can with their tracks crossing Canada and extending down into the United States and Mexico.",
      "\"This merger is like nothing we've seen before. It's creating a railroad of such enormous scope that it's somewhat of a paradigm shift,\" Schwieterman said.",
      "A merged Union Pacific would likely control more than 40% of the nation's freight.",
      "BNSF's Chief of Staff Zak Andersen said his railroad, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, is convinced this merger would be bad for competition and only lead to higher rates and fewer options for shippers.",
      "\"No customer is asking for this. This is strictly a Wall Street play for shareholders,\" Andersen said.",
      "Earlier this fall, Buffett and CPKC's CEO both said they weren't interested in any kind of rail merger right now. Instead, they believe the railroads should continue to find ways to cooperate to deliver shipments more quickly, which can be done without all the complications of a merger. Still, CSX decided to replace its CEO this fall with an executive who has a background leading companies through major mergers.",

    "story": [
      "Affinity Partners, the private equity firm founded by President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, said Tuesday that it has dropped out of Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery.",
      "The exit, first reported by Bloomberg, came a week after Paramount Skydance made the all-cash bid to Warner Bros. Discovery, just days after Netflix had\u00a0agreed to buy a part of Warner Bros.\u00a0in a deal valued at $82.7 billion.",
      "\"With\u2004two\u2004strong competitors\u2004vying to secure\u2004the future\u2004of this\u2004unique American\u2004asset,\u2004Affinity\u2004has\u2004decided no longer to pursue\u2004the opportunity,\" an Affinity spokesperson told CBS News in a statement. \"The dynamics\u2004of the investment have changed significantly\u2004since we initially became\u2004involved\u2004in October. We\u2004continue to\u2004believe\u2004there is a strong strategic rationale for Paramount's offer.\"",
      "Paramount Skydance is the parent company of CBS News.",
      "In addition to Affinity, Paramount Skydance's bid had other outside financing partners, according to a Paramount Skydance regulatory filing, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Qatar Investment Authority.",
      "Affinity's role in the Paramount offer generated some criticism over the firm's connection to Mr. Trump, and some Democratic lawmakers expressed concerns over foreign money in America's largest media companies.",
      "\"I'm deeply concerned about the implications here for data privacy, democracy and our media ecosystem,\" Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts said last week in a joint letter to Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav.",
      "The outside investment firms have agreed to give up any governance rights, including seats on the board of directors of a combined firm, according to the regulatory filing. Mr. Trump has also said he plans to be involved in the government approval process of a deal. The president had signaled the Netflix-Warner Bros. deal could face hurdles, saying the combined company's size \"could be a problem.\" He also said he would be involved in any decision about whether the federal government should approve the deal.",
      "Regardless of Paramount Skydance's bid, Netflix had already reached an agreement to purchase some of Warner Bros. Discovery, including the film studio and streaming service HBO Max.",
      "Netflix's deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery spins off its cable television networks division, Discovery Global, which is now expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.",
      "Paramount Skydance's tender offer is set to expire on Jan. 8, 2026, unless it is extended.

    "summary": "Newly released documents are renewing interest in how Jeffrey Epstein amassed his fortune. Here's how he made his money.",
    "story": [
      "Newly released financial documents and photos obtained from the estate of convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0are reigniting interest in the late sex offender's\u00a0wealth and how he amassed it.",
      "Accused of abusing dozens of teenage girls before dying by suicide in a federal prison in 2019, the politically connected multimillionaire never graduated from college, but still wound up socializing with a range of major public figures, from former U.S. presidents and software moguls to members of the British royal family.",
      "The grandson of Jewish immigrants, Epstein was raised in Brooklyn, where he excelled in math and graduated from high school early, briefly attending Cooper Union and New York University, according to published reports over the years by multiple news outlets, some citing court documents.",
      "The photos, released Dec. 12 by Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, include images of prominent figures such as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, billionaire Bill Gates, filmmaker Woody Allen and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. The photos do not implicate any of those pictured in Epstein's crimes.",
      "Earlier in the month, the same committee had released financial records related to Epstein from JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank, as well as photos and videos of the financier's private island in the Caribbean.",
      "Epstein was a major client of JPMorgan Chase's private banking division for years before the bank cut ties with him in 2013. Epstein then took his business to Deutsche Bank, where he remained until 2018.",
      "Separately from the Oversight Committee's document release, Congress has passed a bill last month giving the Justice Department 30 days to release all records it has related to Epstein. President Trump signed the bill into law on Nov. 19.",
      "The controversy over Epstein's death has proved politically sensitive\u00a0after Mr. Trump returned to office in January of 2025. The president had earlier urged Republicans to avoid focusing on the Epstein issue, initially describing the effort to release more records as a distraction tactic, but reversed his stance in November.",
      "Mr. Trump, who has been accused of no wrongdoing, had been friends with Epstein but later cut his ties with the businessman.",
      "What was Jeffrey Epstein's net worth?",
      "At the time when the disgraced financier was found dead at 66 in a Manhattan jail cell in August of 2019, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, a filing in his criminal case pegged\u00a0his net worth at roughly $560 million. Epstein's assets also included a number of lavish properties.",
      "Epstein owned a palatial townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan worth more than $50 million. He also owned a mansion in Palm Beach, Florida, worth about $12 million; a ranch in New Mexico valued at just over $17 million; and an apartment in Paris worth an estimated $8.6 million.",
      "His two private Caribbean islands \u2014 Great St. James and Little St. James \u2014 were together valued at $86 million following his death, but purchased for $60 million in 2023 by billionaire Stephen Deckoff, founder of alternative investment firm Black Diamond Capital Management. Epstein also owned a private jet.",
      "What did Jeffrey Epstein do for a living?",
      "While in his early 20s, Epstein in 1974 started teaching math at The Dalton School, one of New York's most prestigious prep schools, and left in 1976, with an administrator\u00a0telling\u00a0the New York Times he'd dismissed Epstein for poor performance.",
      "But the stint at Dalton had him tutoring the son of Bear Stearns CEO Alan Greenberg, which led to a job at the investment bank before it collapsed in 2008 following the housing crash. Epstein then became a money manager for billionaires including Les Wexner, founder and CEO of L Brands, and Apollo Global Management Chairman Leon Black. Black paid Epstein $158 million for tax and estate planning services, according to the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "A law firm retained by Apollo's board to review Black's dealings with Epstein cleared Black, who stepped down as chairman and CEO of the private equity firm in 2021, of any possible wrongdoing.",
      "Black in July of 2023 agreed to pay $62.5 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to be released from any potential claims arising from the territory's probe into Epstein's sex trafficking operation. The four-page settlement stipulated that it didn't constitute an \"admission of liability\" by Black, according to the New York Times.",
      "For more than a decade, Epstein was\u00a0Wexner's personal money manager\u00a0and business adviser, making hundreds of millions of dollars managing Wexner's billions.",
      "\"Epstein's crimes are abhorrent, and we applaud every effort to bring justice to those harmed,\" L Brands told CBS MoneyWatch in 2019.",
      "Wexner said in an email to employees at the time that he regretted he ever \"crossed paths\" with Epstein. \"When Mr. Epstein was my personal money manager, he was involved in many aspects of my financial life,\" the email stated. \"But let me assure you that I was NEVER aware of the illegal activity charged in the indictment.\"",
      "Where else did Epstein get his money?",
      "JPMorgan Chase loaned Epstein money and regularly let him withdraw large sums of cash from 1998 through August 2013, according to a class-action lawsuit settled by the nation's largest bank in 2023 for a reported $290 million. The money was slated to go to almost 200 Epstein victims, according to the New York Times.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch in June of 2023, JPMorgan called Epstein's behavior \"monstrous,\" and said it regretted any association with the disgraced financier.",
      "Epstein also had financial dealings with Deutsche Bank, which in May 2023 agreed to pay $75 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the German bank \"knowingly benefited\" from his sex trafficking and profited from doing business with him.",
      "Deutsche Bank declined to comment on the settlement. In 2020, it acknowledged its \"error of onboarding Epstein in 2013 and the weaknesses in our processes.\"",
      "In October, Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, pointed to\u00a0$1.5 billion in suspicious financial transactions that had been flagged by the banks and were tied to Epstein's alleged sex trafficking crimes. The same month, Bank of America was sued by one of Epstein's victims, who alleged the bank facilitated and also benefited from his alleged crimes.",
      "Bank of America had no comment on the lawsuit.",
      "For how much did he buy his islands?",
      "Epstein owned two neighboring islands. He paid $7.95 million in 1998 for the 75-acre Little St. James, according to the New York Post and New York Magazine. In 2016, Epstein paid more than $20 million for the 165-acre Great St. James, according to CNBC and the Wall Street Journal.",

    "summary": "Automakers Hyundai and Kia have reached a settlement with dozens of states over anti-theft technology in models of their vehicles.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Hyundai and Kia owners can get free repairs under a settlement announced Tuesday by Minnesota's attorney general, who led an effort by dozens of states that argued the vehicles weren't equipped with proper anti-theft technology, leaving them vulnerable to thefts.",
      "The settlement comes after a rash of Hyundai and Kia thefts prompted nearly two dozen state attorneys general in 2023 to demand the automakers take action.",
      "In 2023, the Highway Loss Data Institute, a unit of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety,\u00a0found\u00a0that Hyundai and Kia vehicles without \"engine immobilizers,\" an anti-theft device that were standard on other new cars at the time, had a vehicle theft claim rate of 2.18 per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The rest of the industry combined had a rate of 1.21.",
      "Under the nationwide settlement, the companies will offer a free repair to all eligible vehicles at a cost that could top $500 million, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said. Hyundai and Kia must also outfit all future vehicles sold in the U.S. with engine immobilizers, as well as pay up to $4.5 million of restitution to people whose vehicles were damaged by thieves.",
      "The settlement was reached by 35 states, including California, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. The vehicles eligible for fixes date as far back as 2011 and as recently as 2022. About 9 million eligible vehicles were sold nationwide.",
      "TikTok videos of thefts",
      "Beginning in 2021, thefts of Hyundai and Kia vehicles soared in part because videos posted to TikTok and other social media demonstrated how someone could steal a car with just a screwdriver and a USB cable.",
      "Minneapolis reported an 836% increase in Hyundai and Kia thefts from 2021 to 2022, and Ellison announced an investigation into the automakers in early 2023.",
      "Ellison said the two companies installed engine immobilizers on cars sold in Mexico and Canada, but not widely in the U.S., leading to car thefts, crimes and crashes that injured and even killed people, including teenagers.",
      "\"This crisis that we're talking about today started in a boardroom, traveled through the Internet and ended up in tragic results when somebody stole those cars,\" Ellison said at a news conference.",
      "He was joined by Twin Cities officials, a woman whose mother was killed when a stolen Kia crashed into her parents' vehicle and a man whose car was stolen nine times \u2014 as recently as Monday night, and including seven times after a previous software fix.",
      "Under the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will install a zinc sleeve to stop would-be thieves from cracking open a vehicle's ignition cylinder and starting the car.",
      "Eligible customers will have one year from the date of the companies' notice to get the repair at an authorized dealership. The repairs are expected to be available from early 2026 through early 2027.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News, Kia said the agreement is the latest step it has taken to help its customers and prevent theft.",
      "\"These include the development and introduction of a free software security upgrade that has been found to significantly reduce theft rates, the distribution of hundreds of thousands of steering wheel locks to our customers at no cost, and the rollout of a zinc-sleeve hardware modification that combats this social media-inspired theft method by reinforcing the ignition cylinder body and preventing its removal through the technique that was made popular online,\" the automaker said.",

    "summary": "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets following a worldwide backlash, with some final seats available for $60.",
    "story": [
      "FIFA slashed the price of some World Cup tickets for teams' most loyal fans following a global backlash and some will get $60 seats for the final instead of being asked to pay $4,185.",
      "FIFA said Tuesday that $60 tickets will be made available for every game at the tournament in North America, going to the national federations whose teams are playing. Those federations decide how to distribute them to loyal fans who have attended previous games at home and on the road.",
      "The number of $60 tickets for each game is likely to be in the hundreds, rather than thousands, in what FIFA is now calling a \"Supporter Entry Tier\" price category.",
      "FIFA did not specify exactly why it so dramatically changed strategy, but said the lower prices are \"designed to further support travelling fans following their national teams across the tournament.\"",
      "The World Cup in North America will be the first edition that features 48 teams \u2014 up from 32 \u2014 and is expected to earn FIFA at least $10 billion in revenue. Teams will play in 16 cities across the U.S., Canada and Mexico.",
      "But fans worldwide reacted with shock and anger last week on seeing FIFA's ticketing plans that gave participating teams no tickets in the lowest-priced category.",
      "The cheapest prices ranged from $120 to $265 for group-stage games that did not involve the three co-hosting countries.",
      "FIFA had set those prices despite the co-hosts having pledged eight years ago \u2014 when they were bidding for the tournament \u2014 that hundreds of thousands of $21 tickets would be made available.",
      "Criticism from fans, especially in Europe, had been increasing for several months over plans for \"dynamic pricing\" plus extra fees on a FIFA-run resale platform \u2014 both features which are common in the U.S. entertainment industry but not to soccer fans worldwide.",
      "Fan anger intensified last week when it became clear loyal supporters would have no access to the cheapest category tickets and that fans who wanted to reserve a ticket for all of their team's potential games \u2014 through the final \u2014 would not get refunded until after the tournament.",
      "In another climbdown Tuesday, FIFA said it would waive its administrative fees when refunds are made after the July 19 final.",
      "The 12 four-team groups that make up the World Cup\u00a0draw were selected earlier in December. The United States will play in Group D, along with Paraguay, Australia and the winner of UEFA playoff C. The teams there are Turkey, Romania, Slovakia, and Kosovo. The playoff games will be decided in March 2026.",
      "The World Cup games will begin on June 11, with a game between Mexico and South Africa in Mexico City and South Korea playing the winner of UEFA playoff D in Guadalajara. The World Cup final will be held in New Jersey on July 19.",

    "summary": "The family of Tony Hsieh, who died at 46, is disputing a will that emerged in 2025, allegedly from a Pakistani man with no ties to the businessman.",
    "story": [
      "The family of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh claims a mysterious will that surfaced this year for the executive's $500 million fortune is a \"sham\" and is asking a court to invalidate the document.",
      "The battle over the will comes five years after Hseih's\u00a0death at age 46 from complications due to smoke inhalation from a house fire. After his death, which was ruled accidental, his family said Hsieh had died\u00a0without leaving a will.",
      "Earlier this year, however, a man purportedly named Kashif Singh claimed he had found Hsieh's will among his late grandfather's possessions. Singh claimed that his grandfather, Pir Muhammad, and Hsieh were \"dear friends,\" although there's no evidence that the two knew each other, according to the Dec. 15\u00a0court filing, published by Las Vegas' KSNV-TV.",
      "Attorneys for Hsieh's family didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Hsieh, a Harvard University graduate, joined Zappos\u2014 then called ShoeSite.com \u2014 in 1999. Zappos was sold to Amazon for $1.2 billion in 2009, and Hsieh remained with the e-commerce company until he retired in 2020.",
      "Reasons for suspicion",
      "The court filing asks that the will be ruled a forgery, citing evidence that Hsieh's supposed signature is fake and that he had no known connection to Muhammad. According to the family's lawsuit, the will nominates two attorneys, who allegedly did not know Hsieh, to serve as his co-executors and oversee his estate.",
      "\"Scams come in all shapes and sizes,\" the Hsieh family's suit alleges. \"In this case, the scam is in the form of a document being touted as the purported will of Anthony 'Tony' Hsieh.\"",
      "It added, \"The document was allegedly found by a complete stranger, many years after Tony's death, in the possession of the stranger's deceased grandfather, Pir Muhammad, a 91-year-old Pakistani man with no known ties to Tony.\"",
      "The filing also notes that the document includes misspellings of Hsieh's name.",
      "The Hsieh family hired an expert in detecting counterfeits to examine Hsieh's purported signatures on the will, the filing notes. The expert concluded there were \"numerous unexplained differences\" compared with Hsieh's known handwriting, leading him to conclude the will was forged.",
      "Hsieh's family also claims that there's no evidence the businessman attended the will's signing, which supposedly occurred in March 2015, given that none of his calendars, emails and other documentation noted such an event.",
      "It also claims that the five people who allegedly witnessed Hsieh signing the will cannot be located, and that \"their contact information has been fabricated, and likely, they do not exist in real life.\"",

Warner is home to the storied movie studio that created hits like \"Barbie\" and popular franchises such as \"The Hobbit\" and \"Harry Potter.\"",
      "The letter comes as Netflix faces a competing bid from Paramount Skydance (the parent company of CBS News), which on December 8 launched a hostile bid to buy all of Warner Bros. Discovery for roughly $108 billion. Unlike Netflix, Paramount is also offering to buy Warner's cable brands, which include CNN, Discovery Channel, HBO, TBS and TNT.",

Many of those affected by the pause are likely to be legal immigrants who are currently in the U.S. and are seeking to change their status or become citizens.",
      "Earlier in December, the Trump administration directed U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to completely freeze all immigration petitions \u2014 including requests for American citizenship and permanent residency \u2014 made by those already in the U.S. who are nationals of the 19 countries he banned or restricted travel from in June. That order is colloquially known as the \"travel ban.\"",
      "It was one of several immigration restrictions the administration announced in the wake of the Thanksgiving week shooting of two National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., an attack allegedly carried out by an Afghan national. The administration also suspended all decisions for asylum cases handled by USCIS and the processing of all immigration and visa requests by Afghans.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump expanded that \"travel ban\" proclamation to include 20 additional nations, fully barring immigrants and travelers from 5 new countries and partially restricting the entry of people from another 15 nations.",
      "A U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss internal changes that have not been formally announced told CBS News on Thursday that USCIS has expanded its suspension of immigration cases to include the new nationalities added to Mr. Trump's proclamation on Tuesday.",
      "The pause will now affect nationals of Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan and Syria, the new countries facing full travel bans. It will also impact those hailing from Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Cote d'Ivoire, Dominica, Gabon, Gambia, Malawi, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Tanzania, Tonga, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The last set of countries face partial restrictions under the latest proclamation.",
      "Previously, the suspension of immigration cases applied to nationals of Afghanistan, Burundi, Chad, Cuba, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Laos, Myanmar, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan, Togo, Turkmenistan, Yemen and Venezuela. In his latest proclamation, Mr. Trump imposed a full entry ban on citizens of Laos and Sierra Leone, which previously faced partial restrictions.",
      "In a statement posed on social media late Thursday, USCIS Director Joseph Edlow appeared to reference the expansion.",
      "\"USCIS is conducting a comprehensive review of anyone from anywhere who poses a threat to the U.S., including those identified in the President's latest proclamation to restore law and order in our nation's immigration system,\" Edlow wrote.",
      "Taken together, Mr. Trump's latest \"travel ban\" decree affects nationals of over 60% of the countries in Africa and roughly 20% of all nations across the globe.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued the broad restrictions are designed to safeguard national security and address concerns about the ability to vet people from the affected nations. But critics of his administration have denounced the policy as discriminatory, since it mainly applies to nations in Africa and Asia.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 19:53:39 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump signed an order to reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to reschedule marijuana to a lower drug classification, one of the most significant changes to drug policy in decades.",
      "\"Today I'm pleased to announce that I will be signing an executive order to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III controlled substance, with legitimate medical uses,\" Mr. Trump said in a ceremony in the Oval Office on Thursday, flanked by medical professionals. \"We have people begging for me to do this. People who are in great pain.\"",
      "He added: \"I think I probably have received more phone calls on this, on doing what we're doing \u2014 I don't think I received any calls on the other side of it.\"",
      "The order directs the attorney general to \"take all necessary steps to complete the rulemaking process\" to reclassify marijuana from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule III drug \"in the most expeditious manner.\" According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Schedule I applies to substances with \"no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\" \u2014 the agency's most stringent classification, which is also for heroin, LSD and ecstasy in addition to marijuana.",
      "The DEA uses Schedule III for substances \"with a moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence.\" Other Schedule III drugs include Tylenol with codeine, testosterone, anabolic steroids and ketamine.",
      "\"For decades, this action has been requested by American patients suffering from extreme pain, incurable diseases, aggressive cancers, seizure disorders, neurological problems and more,\" the president said.",
      "Moving the drug to a lower schedule does not change the fact that it remains illegal for recreational use at the federal level. But it could open the door to more research into marijuana and expanded medical uses. It might also lower the tax burden for state-licensed marijuana dispensaries in the dozens of states that have legalized the drug, since federal law bars businesses that sell Schedule I substances from taking some tax deductions.",
      "\"Rescheduling will help accelerate research, reduce stigma, attract new investment, and ease some of the tax burdens that have held the industry back. The next transformation will happen when interstate commerce barriers between states are removed,\" said Vince C. Ning, the co-CEO and co-founder of cannabis wholesale platform Nabis.",
      "\"We will have answers very soon. This will allow us to study this issue and to answer these questions for the American people,\" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at the White House.",
      "The president said during his campaign last year that he believes marijuana should instead be a Schedule III drug.",
      "The Biden-era Department of Health and Human Services also recommended bumping marijuana down to Schedule III. The Justice Department, the DEA's parent agency, proposed a rule to reschedule marijuana last year, but the process became mired in over a year of legal and administrative wrangling, leaving the drug in Schedule I status.",
      "Marijuana has been deemed a Schedule I drug since the classification system was created in 1970. In recent years, however, most states have approved the drug for certain medical uses, and 24 states have legalized the drug recreationally. These state policies technically clash with federal law, but the federal government has opted against cracking down on cannabis businesses that are licensed by states.",
      "Some members of both parties have backed looser federal marijuana regulations, often pointing to potential medical benefits \u2014 and polling that shows Americans are increasingly supportive of legalizing medical or recreational uses of the drug.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump said he planned to vote yes on an unsuccessful Florida ballot measure to legalize marijuana recreationally in the state. The measure drew just under 56% of the vote, falling short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "\"I believe it is time to end needless arrests and incarcerations of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use. We must also implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,\" the president wrote on Truth Social last year.",
      "But some lawmakers remain wary. A group of 22 Republican senators wrote an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday urging him to leave marijuana in the Schedule I category, pointing to health concerns along with worries about intoxicated driving and worker absenteeism.",
      "\"We cannot reindustrialize America if we encourage marijuana use,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In light of the documented dangers of marijuana, facilitating the growth of the marijuana industry is at odds with growing our economy and encouraging healthy lifestyles for Americans.\"",
      "A group of nine House Republicans penned a letter over the summer urging Attorney General Pam Bondi not to shift marijuana to a lower schedule, arguing \"there is no adequate science or data\" to support the change.",
      "\"Marijuana, while different than heroin, still has the potential for abuse and has no scientifically proven medical value,\" the letter states. \"Therefore, rescheduling marijuana would not only be objectively wrong, but it would also imply to our children that marijuana is safe. That couldn't be further from the truth.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, was broadcast on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

Four moderate Republicans signed onto the petition\u00a0Wednesday after days of back and forth on the GOP health care strategy, breaking with their party leadership to back the measure.",
      "\"We have the votes, we have the momentum,\" Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said. \"We have the American people on our side. Let's not waste another second.\"",
      "But even with the success of the petition, a vote on extending the ACA tax credits isn't expected until the chamber reconvenes in January, since seven legislative days must elapse before a discharge motion can be brought to the floor. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"rule that cannot be broken.\"",
      "\"That's the rule,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"There's no way around that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats urged Johnson to act sooner. \"Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives adjourn until we successfully extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for tens of millions of Americans,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Johnson does have the authority to move the process along. Last month, when another small group of Republicans broke with their leaders to sign onto a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Johnson moved quickly to hold a vote on the underlying bill.",
      "But the speaker indicated that Republicans don't intend to address the health care issue until the new year. Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the measure will be considered during the first week of January upon the House's return, calling it \"inevitable.\" He added that Republicans plan to hold additional votes on their health care policies when they return.",
      "\"We'll be back in January to do much more of this,\" Johnson said.",
      "House GOP leaders canceled votes for Friday after the chamber on Wednesday approved a health care bill that Republicans say would lower health insurance premiums for Americans, but does not include an extension of the expiring ACA tax credits.",
      "Jeffries was asked Thursday afternoon whether he would consider supporting other bipartisan proposals to extend the credits with reforms, if the three-year extension makes it out of the House but fails in the Senate.",
      "\"The House has to work its will first,\" he replied. \"Once the House works its will \u2014 which should be taking place today, tomorrow, before the end of the year, but at least as early as when we get back in January \u2014 then we'll send the bill over to the Senate. And we'll see what the senators decide to do. We're not giving up this fight.\"",
      "Though imminent action appears out of the question, the movement on the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. After a meeting between so-called \"problem solvers\" in both the House and Senate on Wednesday, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed optimism about a solution.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told CBS News that the discharge petition in the House \"gives momentum to the bipartisan work that we've been trying to advance on the Senate side.\" She said she expects health care discussions will continue between both chambers over the holiday break. And the discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should moderate lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "In the upper chamber, senators rejected a clean three-year extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits just last week. But a number of Republicans have expressed interest in extending the credits, as long as some reforms are made to the program.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune Wednesday to bring up the extension if it passes the House.",
      "Schumer noted that every Democrat voted for a three-year extension last week. He added that if the measure passes the House, \"we hope Thune would put it on the floor and let it pass.\"",
      "Thune was noncommittal about whether the Senate would take up a bill to extend the ACA subsidies for three years if it passes the House, noting Wednesday morning to reporters that he didn't expect a vote this week.",
      "Last month, the Senate quickly approved a bill to force the release of the Epstein files after a discharge petition prompted a vote in the House. But Thune told reporters that the Epstein and health care issues are \"very different,\" predicting that while the Epstein measure had near unanimous support in the lower chamber, the health care vote would likely be a partisan one.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump reiterated his support for sending funds \"directly to the people\" to buy their own health care on Thursday, suggesting that the change could implemented rapidly to address health care costs.",
      "On the rising premiums that millions of Americans face in the new year with the expiration of the ACA tax credits, the president said \"they will skyrocket because it was never any good.\"",

    "title": "Who is Erica Knight, the FBI's so-called \"Kash Whisperer?\"",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-kash-patel-erica-knight/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 16:16:50 -0500",
    "summary": "An FBI media adviser has emerged as one of Kash Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the bureau under his leadership.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel was enduring yet another round of negative headlines in October about his frequent use of the FBI's private jet \u2013 this time to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a freestyle wrestling event in State College, Pennsylvania.",
      "An FBI spokesman pushed back on the criticism, citing federal regulations requiring the FBI director to fly on government aircraft. But the most passionate retort came from a little-known FBI media adviser who has emerged as one of Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the FBI under his leadership.",
      "\"Shaming a woman the Director has happily dated for nearly three years is pathetic and, frankly, disgusting,\" Erica Knight wrote on X. \"Hot take \u2013 when someone's arrested 28,000 violent criminals and taken millions in drugs off the streets, maybe we can also support their happiness.\"",
      "It was a heartfelt but strikingly personal response from a law enforcement agency known for its buttoned-up communications style. But Knight is not the typical government spokeswoman. She's Patel's friend and longtime personal publicist, hired earlier this year to help shake up the bureau's communications strategy. She's also amplified the director's public messaging and touted what the FBI leadership sees as its successes.",
      "In one testament to their friendship, shortly after he was sworn in as FBI director, Patel posted a picture of himself in the Oval Office with Knight and wrote on X: \"I have been truly blessed to have the best captain and teammate @_ericaKnight \u2013 she has been there since day 1, without her I would not be in this position today. She is the best publicist in America, an absolute force.\"",
      "Glowing public testimonials like this have left some current and former FBI agents questioning Knight's taxpayer-funded role, especially since the FBI already has a sprawling media department.",
      "Those questions have surfaced amid growing concerns inside the agency. Two bureau sources tell CBS News that they believe Patel is using public resources in ways that push the boundaries of traditionally accepted FBI practice. Beyond the trips to visit his girlfriend, Patel has used FBI aircraft to go to sporting events \u2014 a golf outing in Scotland with friends and a trip to a private hunting reserve in Texas owned by the family of a GOP donor.",
      "He's also been slammed by critics for assigning FBI SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, country music performer Alexis Wilkins, at taxpayer expense. (Wilkins has said she has been the target of multiple death threats since Patel became FBI director.)",
      "FBI officials say Patel reimburses the government for his personal flights and point out that federal regulations require him to use government aircraft for both personal and official travel. Nevertheless, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, recently announced a probe into Patel's use of public resources and is demanding he turn over documents related to the trips.",
      "Now, Raskin tells CBS News, he has questions about Patel's PR arrangement with Knight. Raskin has called on the FBI to disclose how much she is being paid.",
      "\"Why should an FBI Director have to hire a taxpayer-funded PR fixer to spin away public criticism,\" Raskin said in an email to CBS News. \"And if there's nothing to hide, then the bureau should have no problem releasing Ms. Knight's contract, showing exactly how much the American taxpayers are paying for her crisis PR services.\"",
      "FBI officials vigorously push back against the criticism, maintaining that Knight's job is not about tending to Patel's personal PR. Rather, they say she works closely in tandem with the Office of Public Affairs to promote the bureau's broader mission. In an interview with CBS News, a senior FBI official who asked not to be named called the notion that she serves only the director \"entirely false.\"",
      "\"She is not a PR representative for the director,\" the official said. \"She does specific work related to FBI communications.\"",
      "Still, a number of news outlets, including the New Yorker, CNN, Scripps News and Fox News, identified Knight in their reports as Patel's spokesperson or his adviser.",
      "Inside the agency, speculation about how much she's being paid has been widespread. Typically, such contracts are public, but the agency declined a request from CBS News for details of Knight's compensation, and Knight, in an interview, also declined to disclose information about her salary.",
      "\"The FBI absolutely needs to be more forward-leaning and transparent in terms of its communications,\" said Chris O'Leary, a former senior FBI agent. \"But Patel appears to be putting the spotlight on himself, rather than on the institution \u2013 at taxpayer expense.\"",
      "Federal salaries are typically public information. Knight, who works from outside of Washington, is not a federal employee but rather a contractor \u2013 an arrangement that makes it harder to determine her actual compensation. Her direct employer is Xpect Solutions, a technology and security services firm. The FBI has been a long-time customer of Xpect Solutions, and sources familiar with the arrangement say Knight's salary is paid to the company out of the FBI Office of Public Affairs budget. Xpect Solutions did not respond to a request for comment about Knight's employment.",
      "Ben Williamson, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, told CBS News that Knight's contract with the FBI is \"entirely consistent with procurement rules and ethical guidelines, and any suggestion otherwise from CBS or elsewhere says more about their lack of basic research than it does anything else.\"",
      "Williamson said he and Knight, who reports both to him and Patel, speak daily. He described her as \"a valuable member of our press and communications office and one of the best operatives I've worked with in a decade.\"",
      "Patel met Knight after he left the first Trump administration in 2021 \u2013 the two were introduced by a mutual friend, according to a source familiar with the relationship. Knight was a publicist and crisis communications specialist with a growing client list; and Patel was on a mission to raise his profile.",
      "With Knight's help, Patel flooded the media with cable news and podcast appearances, lucrative speeches and book events, all aimed at cheering on the MAGA agenda and defending Donald Trump.",
      "The effort helped put him on the short list for FBI director, and when he was selected to the post, Knight came along.",
      "Since joining the government PR team, Knight has become a relentless champion of her client, touting the FBI's law-and-order accomplishments (\"President Trump's administration and Director Patel's FBI are dismantling the cartels and crushing the fentanyl crisis,\" she posted on X last month).",
      "In some ways, the role is not new \u2013 the FBI has long had a vast PR operation \u2014 one FBI source said there are well over 150\u00a0 staff in the bureau's office of public affairs, with 60 or so working out of headquarters in Washington and the rest in the bureau's 56 field offices. J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of bureau headquarters.",
      "For his part, Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, Marine and federal prosecutor, had little time for mingling with reporters and had no social media presence.",
      "James Comey, according to one of his advisers, believed more public engagement was critical to restoring trust in the FBI. Comey hired a law professor and friend, Daniel Richman, as a special government employee who worked on multiple projects for Comey, among them, interacting occasionally with reporters on sensitive investigations.",
      "Patel's immediate predecessor as FBI director, Christopher Wray, was so reticent about putting himself in the spotlight that agents often grumbled that he wasn't aggressive enough in defending the bureau. One close adviser alleged that he regularly admonished agents, \"Be a workhorse, not a show horse.\"",
      "Knight, in an interview, said the FBI's more aggressive public PR strategy aligns with Patel's avowed efforts to be a disruptor at the hidebound agency.",
      "\"Kash and [co-Deputy Director] Dan [Bongiono] were not hired to do business as usual,\" Knight said in an interview. \"They wanted to change the way things were done, help make the American people safe, and restore trust in the FBI. I don't think you can do that without communicating.\"",
      "Those who have interacted with her say Knight is skilled at cultivating relationships with reporters covering Patel. She has a reputation for being responsive to their questions and providing accurate information, even as she pushes for more favorable coverage of Patel.",
      "Her close relationship and direct access to Patel allow her to channel his views or get his personal reaction to the stories they're working on. One reporter called her \"the Kash whisperer.\"",
      "Knight, according to sources familiar with her role, works with Williamson to draft statements under Patel's name, and his talking points for interviews and his posts on X, where he remains a prolific poster.",
      "Knight has represented other clients in the MAGA world, too.",
      "\"Erica is a powerhouse,\" said Alina Habba, who until recently had been serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, but stepped down after a federal appeals court ruled that she was unlawfully appointed. Habba hired Knight when she was serving as a private defense lawyer for Donald Trump. Even before Patel completes his first year in the job, supporters and critics say it is hard to dispute the notion that he has been a disruptor, for better or worse.",
      "Patel's supporters say he's dragging the FBI into a new media age, one dominated by social media. And for that, Erica Knight has been there for every step \u2014 and every social media post.",

    "summary": "A federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that sought to require members of Congress to submit requests a week before visiting ICE detention facilities.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a Trump administration policy that sought to require members of Congress to submit requests a week before visiting and inspecting Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the policy likely violated an appropriations law passed by Congress saying that the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, cannot use funds to require lawmakers in Congress to \"provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility\" to conduct oversight.",
      "That DHS policy, announced in June, said members of Congress should file requests to inspect ICE facilities a minimum of seven days before making the visit, and that only Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem could waive that requirement. Before that policy, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit ICE facilities, without prior notice.",
      "\"Contrary to Defendants' suggestion, then, (appropriations law) does entitle Members of Congress to access ICE facilities without being subject to a notice requirement,\" Cobb wrote in her ruling Wednesday.",
      "The D.C.-based judge's order stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the groups Democracy Forward Foundation and American Oversight on behalf of a dozen Democratic lawmakers in Congress who attempted to inspect ICE detention centers.",
      "In a statement, New York Rep. Dan Goldman, a Democrat and one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said Wednesday's order vindicated lawmakers' \"statutory right to conduct oversight.\"",
      "\"For months, masked, unidentified ICE agents have detained law-abiding immigrants in inhumane and unconstitutional conditions, while DHS has repeatedly and unlawfully blocked me and other Members of Congress from inspecting these facilities,\" Goldman said.",
      "The Trump administration has argued ICE detention site visits by members of Congress should not interfere with President Trump's constitutional powers. It has also accused Democratic lawmakers of going to ICE facilities for political purposes.",
      "DHS said in a Thursday statement: \"In Fiscal Year 2025, we supported more facility visits than any year under the Biden-Harris administration. These requests must be part of legitimate congressional oversight activities, and far too often they are just for a media act. Without proper support, such visits threaten the safety of ICE personnel, the detainees, and Members of Congress alike.\"",
      "The Justice Department charged Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey with assaulting law enforcement during a clash at an ICE detention facility in Newark. McIver has called the charges politically motivated.",
      "Wednesday's order also suspended a Trump administration policy that argued ICE field offices were not detention centers and thus not subject to unfettered congressional oversight. Democratic lawmakers have argued those facilities, even though they're not long-term detention centers, should be subject to inspections since they have been used to hold detainees for days in some cities, including in New York.",
      "The ruling comes amid a historic expansion of ICE's detention system under the second Trump administration.",
      "As of Nov. 30, ICE was holding roughly 66,000 individuals facing deportation in detention centers across the U.S., an all-time high, according to agency figures. Roughly 47% of those detainees lacked criminal records and were being held solely due to civil violations of immigration law. Some 26% of the detainees had criminal convictions and the other 26% had pending charges, the statistics show.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 15:10:03 -0500",
    "summary": "North Carolina was among the GOP-led states this year that redrew congressional lines mid-decade in an attempt to benefit Republicans.",
    "story": [
      "North Carolina Republicans redrew the state's congressional maps this fall, in the hopes of improving their chances at ousting a Democrat in one of the country's most competitive districts.",
      "In doing so, they may have created a window for a Democrat to make what has been a reliably Republican neighboring seat more competitive.",
      "CBS News has learned that Allison Jaslow, an Iraq War veteran, plans to file Thursday for North Carolina's third congressional district seat. The race in the South could become a key contest in Democrats' quest to win back a majority next fall in the U.S. House.",
      "\"I'm running for Congress because the people of North Carolina's 3rd congressional district deserve someone who will show up and fight for them,\" Jaslow said in a campaign statement.",
      "GOP Rep. Greg Murphy has held the seat since a summer 2019 special election, and won another term in the 2024 election with more than 77% of the vote.",
      "But the physician's political future became a bit more muddled this fall, after Republican legislators in Raleigh changed the boundaries of his seat in an attempt to make the Democratic-held 1st Congressional District more favorable to Republicans. In part, the new map transferred a large swath of the eastern portion of Murphy's 3rd Congressional District to the 1st District, which is held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis.",
      "GOP leaders made the move as similar efforts played out around the country to try to protect the party's narrow majority in the U.S. House.",
      "Murphy announced afterwards that he would run for another term in Congress and was soon endorsed by President Trump.",
      "\"I am very excited about serving my old friends again in Greene, Lenoir and eastern Wayne while looking forward to new friendships in western Wayne and Wilson County,\" Murphy said in a statement at the time. \"These new counties will further strengthen my commitment to our beloved veterans and active-duty military, local manufacturing interests as well as North Carolina's cherished and vital agricultural economy.\"",
      "While the 1st and 3rd Districts are both still viewed as Republican-leaning areas, the impact brought about by redistricting isn't without political risk for conservatives.",
      "Murphy's district is now 43% Democratic, up from 39% Democratic before it was redrawn, whereas Davis' seat went from being 48% to 44% Democratic, according to a CBS News analysis of 2024 presidential election data.",
      "Mr. Trump has won North Carolina in the last three presidential elections, though each of the races in the state has been close. He has offered his support to Murphy.",
      "\"Greg knows the Wisdom and Courage required to Defend our Country, Support our Brave Military/Veterans, and Ensure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,\" Trump said in an October social media post.",
      "Hefty political spending is already expected to head to the state for next year's midterms, where former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper represents his party's best chance at winning back a GOP-held seat in the Senate. To have a reasonable shot at defeating Murphy, Democrats will likely need plenty to break their way, along with the typical political gravity of an incumbent president's party struggling in the midterms.",
      "Jaslow also brings a notable biography to the contest. After the 2018 midterms, Jaslow worked as the executive director of House Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to her Linkedin page. Her departure, along with several other staffers, became public in July 2019 during concerns over a lack of diversity at the party organization, according to earlier CBS News reporting.",
      "Until earlier this year, she had worked as the CEO of The Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. In announcing her departure, a news release described her as having \"made history in 2023 as the first woman and first openly gay veteran to lead a major veterans service organization.\"",
      "As of Thursday, she does not live in the district, but is expected to soon.",
      "And in opening her campaign, Jaslow made clear what kind of focus she plans to take against the Republican incumbent within this newly shaped North Carolina district.",
      "\"As an American who has dedicated my life to serving my country, first in uniform and with the responsibility of leading soldiers in wartime, I'm furious that Greg Murphy seems to believe that public service is about serving himself and his friends and not his constituents,\" Jaslow said in a statement.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-transgender-care-minros-proposal/",
    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:38:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to effectively ban gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions on transgender Americans.",
      "The sweeping proposals include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures.",
      "\"This is not medicine, it is malpractice,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures on children in a news conference on Thursday. \"Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements mark the most significant moves the administration has taken to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children. They would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and funded by Medicaid, which includes federal and state dollars.",
      "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration's claims about gender-affirming care and said Thursday's moves would put lives at risk.",
      "\"The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,\" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth, who called the changes a \"one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government\" on a decision that should be between a doctor and patient.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care.",
      "The Supreme Court's recent decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. Tennessee's law, known as SB1, prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. As CBS News previously reported, Tennessee argued that it had a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. The federal government must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions becoming permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.",
      "But the proposed rules will likely further intimidate health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.",
      "Nearly all U.S. hospitals participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the federal government's largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers.",
      "The same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.",
      "Kennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability.",
      "In a related move, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to a dozen companies that market chest-binding vests and other equipment used by people with gender dysphoria. Manufacturers include GenderBender LLC of Carson, California and TomboyX of Seattle. The FDA letters state that chest binders can only be legally marketed for FDA-approved medical uses, such as recovery after mastectomy surgery.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments \"a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,\" and suggested children with gender dysphoria are \"confused, lost and need help.\"",
      "Polling shows many Americans agree with the administration's view of the issue. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.",
      "Chloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, \"have finally been heard.\"",
      "But the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict care for gender dysphoria.",
      "\"In an effort to strongarm hospitals into participating in the administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda, the Trump Administration is forcing health care systems to choose between providing lifesaving care for LGBTQ+ young people and accepting crucial federal funding,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, a Washington-based OB/GYN and president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement.",
      "\"This is a lose-lose situation where lives are inevitably on the line. \"",
      "The announcements build on a wave of actions President Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders aimed at cutting off federal support for gender transitions for people under age 19 and barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "On Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. Another bill under consideration in the House on Thursday aims to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes in patients. Surgery is rare for minors.",

    "story": [
      "A Kremlin envoy will travel to Florida to discuss a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said Thursday, as European Union leaders weighed a major loan to help the Ukrainian government.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is set to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",
      "Asked about the meeting in Miami, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that Moscow was preparing for contacts with the U.S. to learn about the results of the meetings in Berlin, but didn't give further details.",
      "Witkoff will also meet Friday in Miami with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss the next phase of the Gaza deal, a senior State Department official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The first phase of the Gaza peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "At the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn't been able to take by force.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine's military and financial needs over the next two years.",
      "\"We are in the war and United States are decision-makers, who can really stop Putin and I count on this,\" Zelenskyy said. \"I really count on pressure from United States. Putin does not want to stop this war, but he can if United States will pressure more.\"",
      "As European allies gathered for the high-stakes summit, Russia and Ukraine exchanged more aerial attacks.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that Russia fired 82 drones of various types at Ukraine overnight, 63 of which were intercepted or jammed.",
      "In Cherkasy, Russian drones that targeted critical infrastructure wounded six people and left parts of the city without electricity, regional administration head Ihor Taburets said. Russian drones also wounded four people in Kryvyi Rih and seven near Odesa, according to local officials.",
      "In Russia's Rostov region, three people were killed by Ukrainian drones overnight, including two crew members of a cargo ship that was hit in Rostov-on-Don and another man who died in Bataysk. At least 10 others were wounded, according to local officials.",

    "summary": "Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former special counsel Jack Smith defended his prosecutions of President Trump in a closed-door deposition with lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, saying \"the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions.\"",
      "Smith was subpoenaed to testify earlier this month by the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is probing Smith's actions during his time as special counsel during the Biden administration. The committee is investigating what it claims were the \"politically motivated\" prosecutions of Mr. Trump led by Smith.",
      "\"Any objective person who listened today to the deposition would know without any doubt that Jack Smith's investigation is based purely on the facts and the law and the evidence, nothing more and nothing less, and that's what you would expect of Jack, a career public servant who has served this nation for over 30 years as a public servant committed to the rule of law,\" Lanny Breuer, a lawyer for Smith, told reporters after the deposition.",
      "Following the question-and-answer session, Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Panel, said Smith answered every question to \"the satisfaction of any reasonable minded person in that room.\"",
      "Smith \"spent several hours schooling the Judiciary Committee on the professional responsibilities of a prosecutor and the ethical duties of a prosecutor,\" Raskin said. \"And he's a sensational and honorable public servant, and we are lucky to have him in the bar in the United States.\"",
      "Rep. Daniel Goldman, a Democrat from New York, criticized Judiciary Committee chairman Rep. Jim Jordan for having Smith testify behind closed doors first. Previous special counsels, including Robert Mueller and Robert Hur, have appeared before lawmakers for public hearings. Mueller investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and Hur probed former President Joe Biden's handling of sensitive government documents.",
      "\"The accusations against him are complete bogus, and the American people should hear that for themselves,\" he said.",
      "The president was indicted on more than 40 federal charges in two separate cases. The first alleged he unlawfully held onto government documents marked classified after leaving the White House in 2021, and the second stemmed from his alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election.",
      "The president has denied wrongdoing and claimed Smith's investigations were politically motivated \"witch hunts\" that intended to harm his candidacy for the White House.",
      "Both cases were brought to an end after Mr. Trump won a second term in November 2024.",
      "In portions of Smith's opening statement to the committee obtained by CBS News, the former special counsel defended his prosecutorial record and told lawmakers that he made decisions in the investigations \"without regard to President Trump's political association, activities, beliefs, or candidacy in the 2024 presidential election.\"",
      "\"The decision to bring charges against President Trump was mine, but the basis for those charges rests entirely with President Trump and his actions, as alleged in the indictments returned by grand juries in two different districts,\" Smith told lawmakers.",
      "He continued: \"Our investigation developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt that President Trump engaged in a criminal scheme to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and to prevent the lawful transfer of power.\"",
      "Smith said the documents investigation \"developed powerful evidence that showed President Trump willfully retained highly classified documents after he left office in January 2021, storing them at his social club, including in a bathroom and a ballroom where events and gatherings took place.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, Smith said, \"then repeatedly tried to obstruct justice to conceal his continued retention of those documents.\"",
      "In other portions of his opening statement, Smith defended investigative steps taken by his team, including obtaining phone records of sitting Republican lawmakers as part of the 2020 election probe. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, who leads the Senate Judiciary Committee, published a document in October alleging that the FBI obtained phone data from eight GOP senators and one Republican House member as part of the probe.",
      "The records, Smith said, \"were lawfully subpoenaed and were relevant to complete a comprehensive investigation.\"",
      "\"January 6 was an attack on the structure of our democracy in which over 100 heroic law enforcement officers were assaulted. Over 160 individuals later pled guilty to assaulting police officers that day,\" Smith said. \"Exploiting that violence, President Trump and his associates tried to call Members of Congress in furtherance of their criminal scheme, urging them to further delay certification of the 2020 election. I didn't choose those Members; President Trump did.\"",
      "Breuer, one of the attorneys who represents the former special counsel, told reporters before the deposition that Smith \"is showing tremendous courage in light of the remarkable and unprecedented retribution campaign against him by this administration and this White House.\"",
      "Smith is also under investigation by the Office of Special Counsel, an agency that is unrelated to Smith's former position as special counsel. His lawyers called the ethics probe by the Office of the Special Counsel \"imaginary and unfounded.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Every night, Abdullah Ibrahim retreats from the streets into a wooded stretch along the Potomac River.",
      "As night falls and temperatures drop, he erects a tent and builds a fire beneath a canopy of pine, hemlock, and cedar trees.",
      "He evades authorities by rotating use of three tents of different colors at three campsites. As day breaks, he dismantles his shelter, rolls up his belongings, and hides them for the next night. \"They don't see you if you're in the woods,\" the 32-year-old said. \"But make sure it's broken down by morning or they'll find you.\"",
      "During the day, he wanders, stopping at a public library to warm up or a soup kitchen to eat. What's important is to not draw attention to himself for being homeless.",
      "\"Police want us out of the way,\" he said, dressed in a gray jacket and carrying none of his possessions. \"Out of sight, out of mind.\"",
      "Ibrahim has been deliberate about blending in since August, when President Trump placed the district's police under federal control and ordered National Guard soldiers to patrol its streets. The president also ordered homeless people to leave immediately. \"There will be no 'MR. NICE GUY,'\" he posted.",
      "The Trump administration says encampment sweeps have reduced the visibility of homelessness, thereby enhancing the city. \"There is no disputing that Washington, DC is a safer, cleaner, and more beautiful city thanks to President Trump's historic actions to restore the nation's capital,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said.",
      "While there may appear to be fewer homeless people in the nation's capital now, they have not disappeared.",
      "In interviews, homeless people said they are in a constant shuffle, hiding in plain sight. During the day, they stay on the move, grabbing meals at soup kitchens and resting on occasion in public libraries, on park benches, or at bus stops. At night, many unsheltered people bed down in business doorways, on park sidewalks, and on church stoops. Some ride the bus all night, while a few shelter in emergency rooms. Others find respite in the woods or flee to suburbs in Virginia or Maryland.",
      "There are about 5,100 homeless people in Washington, D.C., including in temporary shelters, according to an early-2025 homelessness tally. After Mr. Trump ordered the crackdown on public homelessness, people living in makeshift communities scattered and are now living in the shadows. City officials estimated in August that nearly 700 homeless people were living outdoors without tents or other shelter.",
      "As winter draws near, they are exposed to the elements and grow sicker as chronic ailments such as diabetes and heart disease go untreated. Street medicine providers say that, since the National Guard was deployed, they have faced enormous difficulty finding patients. Many caught up in sweeps have had their lifesaving medications thrown away, and they are more likely to miss medical appointments because they are constantly on the move. Street medicine providers say they can't find their patients to deliver medication or transport them to medical appointments. The constant chaos can suck patients with mental illness and substance use deeper into drug and alcohol addiction, raising the risk of overdose.",
      "Caseworkers report similar disruptions, saying as clients get lost, they break connections essential for obtaining housing documents, particularly IDs and Social Security cards.",
      "District officials and health providers say this cascade will make homelessness worse, threatening public health and public safety and racking up enormous costs for the health care system.",
      "\"It was already hard locating people, but the federal presence just made it worse,\" said Tobie Smith, a street medicine doctor and the executive director of Street Health D.C.",
      "The homeless shuffle",
      "Chris Jones was born and raised in Washington, D.C., but now is homeless, having been pushed out of his tent near the White House in the initial days of the federal homelessness crackdown. He said two of his tents were taken during sweeps. Now, sleeping on a sidewalk outside a church, he doesn't bother trying to get another one. \"Why? What's the point? It'll just get thrown away again.\"",
      "Jones, 57, has a severe knee injury that prevents him from walking some days and said he was scheduled for a knee replacement in December. He said it's important to stay where he is \u2014 he relies on a nearby drugstore to refill his medications for bipolar disorder, diabetes, and high blood pressure. When he's hungry, he goes to a soup kitchen for a meal or tries to get a cheeseburger and a soda from a fast-food joint across the street.",
      "It's important for him to stay outside the church, he said, so his case manager can find him when a permanent housing slot opens up. If it gets too cold, he said, he will cross the street and sleep in the doorway of a business, which can provide a bit more shelter. He wants to get indoors, but for now, he waits.",
      "Since taking control of Washington's police force, the Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on cities and counties across the nation to clear homeless encampments under threat of arrest, citation, or detention. It has ordered or threatened similar National Guard deployments in Los Angeles; Portland, Oregon; and other cities with large homeless populations.",
      "Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said the president is maintaining National Guard and federal law enforcement presence in the nation's capital \"to ensure the long-term success of the federal operation.\" Since March, city and federal officials have removed more than 130 homeless encampments, she said, though some local homelessness experts say that number could be inflated.",
      "The Supreme Court last year made it easier for elected officials and law enforcement to fine or arrest homeless people for living outside. Then, in July of this year, the president issued an executive order calling for a nationwide crackdown on urban camping, including a massive removal of people living outdoors and forced mental health or substance use treatment.",
      "President Trump is also spearheading an overhaul of homelessness policy, moving to slash funding for permanent housing and services for homeless people. The move would limit the use of a long-standing federal policy known as \"Housing First\" that offers housing without mandating mental health or addiction treatment. The National Alliance to End Homelessness warns the move risks displacing at least 170,000 people in permanent supportive housing. The Department of Housing and Urban Development paused the plan on Dec. 8 to make revisions, which it \"intends\" to do, federal housing officials said.",
      "City officials say they are complying with the Trump administration's forceful campaign against homeless people sheltering outside. Pressured by the White House, local officials said they've gotten more aggressive in breaking up camps. Advocates for homeless people say some of the sweeps have been conducted at night and others with little or no notice to move. City leaders believe they could be done more compassionately by offering services and shelter.",
      "\"We've pivoted from the notion of allowing encampments if they didn't violate public health or safety to a position of, 'We don't want you in the streets,'\" said Wayne Turnage, deputy mayor for District of Columbia Health and Human Services, who oversees encampment cleanups. \"It's unsafe, it's unhealthy, and it's dangerous.\" Yet he acknowledges the encampment sweeps can waste city resources as caseworkers and street medicine providers scramble to find their clients and patients.",
      "Advocates say the Trump administration is inciting fear and mistrust between homeless people and those working to help them while wasting taxpayer dollars used to provide care and place people into housing. There are, however, far fewer tents and large-scale encampments visible to tourists and residents.",
      "\"People found safety in those communities and service providers could find them. Now there are people with guns and flashing lights dislocating folks experiencing homelessness without notice and just throwing stuff away,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, campaign and communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center.",
      "District officials say some people have accepted emergency shelter. But even as the city works to connect people with services and expand shelter capacity, officials acknowledge there isn't enough permanent housing or temporary beds for everyone.",
      "And there will be fewer places for people living outside to go.",
      "The city, in its fiscal year 2026 budget, concentrated its homelessness funding on families, funding 336 new permanent supportive housing vouchers. Yet it cut funding for temporary housing for both families and individuals and provided no new permanent supportive housing vouchers for individuals. That means fewer housing slots for single adults, who make up most of those wandering the streets. City officials said, however, that they have slotted 260 more permanent housing units for homeless individuals or families into their construction pipeline.",
      "Worsening health care",
      "The fallout is inundating local soup kitchens with demand, including Miriam's Kitchen in Foggy Bottom. The local institution provides hot meals, housing assistance, and warm blankets to people in need.",
      "Caseworkers say it's becoming increasingly difficult to help clients secure IDs and other documents needed for housing and other social services.",
      "\"I'm looking everywhere, but I can't find people,\" said Cyria Knight, a case worker at Miriam's Kitchen. \"Most of my clients went to Virginia.\"",
      "It's unclear how much of the district's homeless population has fanned out to neighboring Virginia and Maryland communities. There were an estimated 9,700 homeless people in the region in January, months before the Trump crackdown. Four of six counties around Washington saw homelessness rise from 2024, while it fell 9% in the district.",
      "\"I'm not seeing my patients for a month or more, and then when I do, their chronic conditions are uncontrolled. They've been in and out of the ER, and they're more likely to be hospitalized,\" said Anna Graham, a street medicine nurse practitioner for Unity Health Care, a network of clinics in Washington. \"It's just setting us back.\"",
      "Graham's team stations its mobile medical van outside Miriam's Kitchen at dinnertime to better find patients.",
      "Willie Taylor, 63, was figuring out where to sleep for the night after grabbing dinner from Miriam's. He saw Graham to receive his medications for advanced lung disease, seizures, chronic pain, and other health disorders.",
      "He has difficulty walking and needs a wheelchair, which is complicated because he doesn't have a permanent address. Taylor and his medical providers say his previous wheelchairs have been stolen while he slept outdoors at night. He uses a shopping cart to keep him steady, walking around all day, until nightfall.",
      "On a cold November night, Graham helped Taylor figure out his daily medications and checked his vitals. The team handed him a warm coat and hand warmers before sending him back outside.",
      "After walking for about 45 minutes, he found a piece of park pavement where he could build a bed out of tarps and sleeping bags.",
      "\"My body can't take this,\" Taylor said, preparing to sleep. \"There's ice on the concrete. I'm in so much pain; it hurts so much worse when it's cold.\"",
      "Homeless people die younger and cost the health care system more than housed people, largely because conditions go untreated on the streets, and when they do seek care, many go to the ER. Among Medicaid enrollees, homeless people have been estimated to incur $18,764 a year in spending, compared with $7,561 for other enrollees.",
      "Over at the So Others Might Eat soup kitchen earlier that day, Tyree Kelley was finishing his breakfast of a sausage sandwich and hard-boiled eggs. He was considering going into a shelter. The streets were becoming too dangerous for someone like him, he said, referring to the police and National Guard presence. He was feeling the loss of an encampment community that would watch his back.",
      "He's been to the ER at least seven times this year to get care for a broken ankle he sustained falling off an electric scooter. The accident caused him to lose his job and health insurance as a garbageman, he said. His situation has caused him to sink deeper into a depression that began three years ago after his mother died, he said.",
      "Then his father and sister died this year. He began to numb his pain with beer.",
      "\"You get so depressed, being out here,\" said Kelley, 42. \"It gets addictive. You start to not care about even changing your clothes.\"",
      "His depression also led him to seek out marijuana. Then he smoked a joint laced with fentanyl. The overdose sent him to the hospital for days.",
      "\"I actually died and came back,\" he said, crediting other homeless people with administering naloxone and saving his life. \"I need to get out of this, but I feel so stuck.\"",
      "A few blocks west of the White House sits a vacant plot of land that earlier this year held more than a dozen tents. Workers in the area sense what they don't always see.",
      "\"I was here when this was all cleared. A bulldozer came in, and all their stuff was thrown in a garbage truck,\" said Ray Szemborski, who works across the street from the now-empty lot. \"People are still homeless. I still see them around underneath the bridge. Sometimes they're at bus stops, sometimes just walking around. Their tents are gone but they're still here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Four people were killed in a U.S. military strike Wednesday on an alleged drug-running boat in the Eastern Pacific, the Pentagon said. It marks the latest in a series of strikes dating back to early September that the U.S. has conducted on what it claims are drug-trafficking vessels in the region.",
      "In a social media post, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Central and South America, said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the \"lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters.\"",
      "As has been the case with previous such strikes, Southern Command also posted unclassified video showing the boat as it was struck.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The victims were described as \"four male narco-terrorists.\" The U.S. military provided no evidence to support allegations that the boat was ferrying drugs.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted 26 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific or Caribbean since Sept. 2, killing at least 99 people, according to the Pentagon.",
      "In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny on the strikes after the White House, following a report by The Washington Post, confirmed that in the Sept. 2 attack, the same boat was struck twice, or what has been described as a \"double tap\" or follow-on strike.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that the follow-on strike killed two people who had survived the first strike and were waving overhead. A separate source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the two survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat.",
      "A total of 11 people were killed by both strikes on Sept. 2, according to the U.S. military.",
      "While video of the Sept. 2 strikes has been shown to some congressional lawmakers in classified briefings, there has been a push for the Pentagon to release the video publicly. However, Hegseth, speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill,\u00a0said he would not do so.",
      "\"Of course we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,\" Hegseth told reporters.",
      "Some lawmakers and legal experts have contended that the second strike could constitute a war crime.",
      "The vessel strikes have been part of a pressure campaign by the Trump administration on embattled Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom it accuses of being involved in trafficking drugs to the U.S. and collaborating with drug cartels. Venezuela has criticized the boat strikes, and Maduro denies working with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

      "The public's evaluations of the U.S. job market specifically remain net negative. This comes as the latest government data shows somewhat of a mixed bag: more jobs were added in November than economists expected, but the unemployment rate ticked up to its highest level since September 2021.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 19:31:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The votes follow a monthslong military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",
      "The House votes follow two failed efforts in the Senate to prohibit Mr. Trump from continuing military action against drug cartels without approval from Congress. A third Senate vote could happen as soon as this week.",
      "Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                      Grace  Kazarian and \n                                                  \n                                  Patrick  Maguire\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino will be leaving his role in January, he announced in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "\"I want to thank President Trump, AG Bondi, and Director Patel for the opportunity to serve with purpose,\" Bongino wrote in a post on X. \"Most importantly, I want to thank you, my fellow Americans, for the privilege to serve you.\"",
      "President Trump appeared to confirm Bongino's exit earlier Wednesday, telling reporters: \"Dan did a great job. I think he wants to go back to his show.\"",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel called Bongino \"the best partner I could've asked for in helping restore this FBI,\" writing on X that he \"not only completed his mission - he far exceeded it.\"",
      "\"We will miss him but I'm thankful he accepted the call to serve. Our country is better and safer for it,\" Patel wrote.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also thanked Bongino, writing on social media that \"Americans are safer\" because of his service.",
      "The former Secret Service agent and conservative pundit's departure from the FBI ends a tumultuous tenure with the Bureau.",
      "Bongino was named to his post in February by Mr. Trump, and helped oversee the firing of hundreds of career FBI personnel alongside FBI Director Patel.",
      "In May, Bongino gave an interview to \"Fox & Friends\" where he spoke about the difficulties of adjusting to work at the Bureau.",
      "\"The biggest lifestyle change is family-wise,\" Bongino said. \"It was a lot, and it's been tough on the family. People ask all the time, do you like it? No. I don't.\" At another time during the interview, Bongino said, \"I gave up everything for this.\"",
      "Over the summer, Bongino clashed with other Trump administration staffers over a Justice Department and FBI review of the Jeffrey Epstein investigation.",
      "As a political pundit, Bongino had pushed the government to release more evidence on Epstein and suggested a cover-up was afoot. But during his time atop the FBI, the agency's review found that Epstein had no \"client list\" and there was no evidence to support charges against others \u2014 findings that frustrated some Trump allies.",
      "Sources told CBS News at the time that Bongino attended a White House meeting in July with Attorney General Bondi and White House chief of staff Susie Wiles focusing on the fallout of the review. That discussion resulted in a confrontation with Bondi, and at the time, Bongino was weighing whether to resign from his role.",
      "Weeks later, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey was tapped by Mr. Trump to share the role of co-deputy director with Bongino.",
      "Typically, the FBI deputy director role has been a career staffer at the Bureau, but neither of the Trump administration's selections for the role had a history with the FBI before being appointed.",
      "In his role at the FBI, Bongino led a charge to reexamine unsolved high-profile cases, including the 2021 D.C pipe bombings. Earlier this month, the FBI arrested the man suspected of planting pipe bombs outside of the Republican National Committee and Democratic National Committee headquarters on Jan. 5, 2021. Investigators have not revealed a potential motive yet, and court proceedings in the case have just begun.",

Biden is also described as \"by far, the worst president in American history.\"",

      "The Trump administration intends to dismantle one of the world's leading climate research institutions over what it said on Tuesday were concerns about \"climate alarmism,\" despite opposition to the plan.",

      "Any of its operations deemed \"vital,\" such as weather research, will be moved \"to another entity or location,\" he said.",
      "\"This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country,\" Vought said.",
      "The National Science Foundation will be breaking up the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. This facility is one of the largest sources of climate alarmism in the country. A comprehensive review is underway & any vital activities such as weather\u2026",
      "The plan was first\u00a0reported\u00a0by USA Today. It said moves to dismantle NCAR will begin immediately.",
      "Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished NCAR scholar,\u00a0told The Washington Post breaking up the laboratory would result in a major loss of scientific research.",
      "Trenberth, an honorary academic in physics at New Zealand's University of Auckland, said the center was crucial to the search for advanced climate science discoveries.",
      "Antonio Busalacchi, the president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, which oversees NCAR, told the Post that, \"Any plans to dismantle NSF NCAR would set back our nation's ability to predict, prepare for, and respond to severe weather and other natural disasters.\"",
      "The White House noted that NCAR's budget\u00a0more than doubled\u00a0from the 1980s to the 1990s and called it \"the premier research stronghold for left-wing climate lunacy,\" pointing to examples of its research on wind turbines and air pollution.",
      "Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement on Tuesday that he hadn't been briefed on the plans by White House officials, but said, \"If true, public safety is at risk and science is being attacked.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 16 Dec 2025 13:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",
      "Additionally, Instacart charged consumers for Instacart+ subscriptions, which offer perks like free or low-cost delivery, without their consent, the FTC said.",
      "\"We flatly deny any allegations of wrongdoing by the Federal Trade Commission, and we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of our programs. This settlement allows us to move forward and remain focused on delivering value for our customers, shoppers, and retail and brand partners in the communities we serve,\" an Instacart spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "Under the proposed settlement, the grocery service is banned from misrepresenting its delivery service costs and satisfaction guarantees. The company must also obtain consent from shoppers before they are enrolled in any Instacart subscriptions.",
      "Separately, the FTC this week also expressed concern after an investigation by Consumer Reports and Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group, said the company is testing technology that can result in different consumers paying significantly different prices for the same grocery items.",
      "Instacart told CBS News that 10 of its retail partners are testing that approach to pricing, describing such practices as a standard way stores assess customer preferences.",

      "Federal prosecutors announced new indictments Thursday in the widening Minnesota fraud scandal, this time involving two Philadelphia-based men accused of traveling to Minneapolis after a friend told them the taxpayer-funded programs there presented \"a good opportunity to make money.\"",
      "Anthony Waddell Jefferson and Lester Brown are accused of siphoning millions from federally funded programs administered by Minnesota officials that were meant to help people with disabilities and those suffering from addiction.",
      "Unlike many of the individuals previously caught up in the state's sprawling fraud scandal, they don't appear to have ties to Minnesota's large Somali-American community. Prosecutors say they don't appear to have ties to Minnesota at all.",
      "\"Minnesota has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry \u2014 people coming to our state purely to exploit and defraud its programs,\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson, who brought the new charges. \"This is a deeply unsettling reality that all Minnesotans should understand.\"",
      "Court filings allege the men submitted up to $3.5 million in \"fake and inflated bills\" for Medicaid reimbursements after they set up a company intended to provide housing and other services to individuals who qualified for the program. They allegedly fleeced the housing program in Minnesota despite \"living on the other side of the country and having no network in or connections to Minnesota or its communities.\"",

      "Prosecutors said Thursday that they are investigating roughly $18 billion spent on social programs in Minnesota since 2018. CBS News asked how much they believe was fraud, and they said they've \"seen more red flags than legitimate providers.\" Thompson suggested half of the $18 billion or more could be fraudulent",
      "James Clark, the inspector general of Minnesota's Department of Human Services, said in a statement: \"Speculation that half of Medicaid payments for some services are fraudulent is shocking. If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses.\"",
      "Clark said the state is \"moving more aggressively than ever\" to halt possibly fraudulent payments, and requested a meeting with federal prosecutors.",
      "The newest allegations came as the Trump administration and its allies have stepped up attacks on Minnesota's leadership, including Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democratic Party's nominee for vice president in the 2024 elections.",
      "Walz has acknowledged his state fell short in its fraud fighting efforts and listed a series of steps he has taken to implement more safeguards for taxpayer-funded social services.",
      "In recent weeks, the Trump-appointed heads of at least three cabinet agencies have signaled fresh investigations into the state's handling of federal funds \u2014 actions that a spokesperson for Walz called \"politically motivated\" in a statement on Wednesday.",

      "But Thursday's indictments in Minnesota were the latest development in a string of multimillion-dollar fraud schemes that have plagued that state.

      "Additional fraud cases have since come into focus. This year, in August, state officials shut down a housing program designed to help seniors and people with disabilities, citing \"large-scale fraud.\" In September, prosecutors charged eight people with defrauding the program by enrolling as providers and submitting millions in \"fake and inflated bills.\"",
      "Also in September, a person was charged with defrauding another state program that provides services to kids with autism. Her company was accused of hiring unqualified \"behavioral technicians\" and submitting false claims to the state that indicated the staff had worked with children enrolled in the program. She also allegedly paid kickbacks to parents who agreed to enroll their children in the program.",
      "The Treasury Department announced it would investigate whether any of the alleged fraudsters, many of whom are of Somali descent, funnelled money to al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Multiple federal investigators told CBS News there is no evidence taxpayer dollars ever went to al Shabaab, and prosecutors have yet to present evidence linking any of the fraudsters to terrorism.",

    "story": [
      "A top prosecutor suggested on Thursday that the total amount of fraud in Minnesota could be $9 billion or more.",
      "According to First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson, 14 Medicaid services under audit and deemed \"high risk\" for fraud have cost the state $18 billion since 2018.",
      "Thompson said a substantial amount of money billed across those programs is fraudulent, but the exact amount is still under investigation.",
      "\"I don't make these generalizations in a hasty way,\" he said. \"When I say significant amount, I'm talking on the order of half or more. But we'll see. When I look at the claims data and the providers, I see more red flags than I see legitimate providers.\"",
      "Minnesota Department of Human Services Inspector General James Clark released a statement, saying speculation of the amount of fraud occurring is \"shocking.\"",
      "\"If there is evidence of Medicaid fraud, the state should be given the information so DHS can slam the door shut on payments to those individuals and businesses,\" Clark said. \"We have been moving more aggressively than ever to suspend payments where we see evidence of fraud and refer criminals to law enforcement for prosecution. I've previously sent letters to the U.S. Attorney's Office asking them to share evidence of fraud and I'm requesting a meeting immediately to discuss how we can partner to stop criminals now.\"",
      "Thompson said the scale of fraud in Minnesota outpaces that of other states and puts services at risk for people who really need them.",
      "While prosecutors typically see fraud manifest as providers overbilling, Thompson said during a news conference in Minneapolis that companies have been created to provide zero services while pocketing federal funds for international travel, luxury vehicles and lavish lifestyles.",
      "\"The magnitude cannot be overstated,\" Thompson said. \"What we see in Minnesota is not a handful of bad actors committing crimes. It's staggering, industrial-scale fraud.\"",
      "The investigators' new findings may bolster President Trump in his claims that Minnesota is a \"hub of fraudulent money laundering activity\" under Gov. Tim Walz, who was the Democrats' vice presidential nominee in last year's presidential election.",
      "Trump has capitalized on the fraud cases to target the Somali diaspora in Minnesota, calling them \"garbage\" and saying he doesn't want immigrants from the East African country in the U.S.",
      "More than 90% of the people charged in the major fraud cases announced before today were of Somali descent, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office for Minnesota.",
      "Walz has denounced Trump's comments, saying an audit due for completion by late January should give a better picture on the extent of the fraud. He said his administration is taking aggressive action to prevent fraud in the future. A spokesperson for Walz did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday.",
      "Five new defendants have been charged in connection with a Minnesota housing services fraud, Thompson said. Two of them pocketed $750,000 instead of helping Medicaid recipients find stable housing, he said. Prosecutors allege they used the proceeds to travel to international destinations, including London, Istanbul and Dubai.",
      "One defendant submitted $1.4 million in fraudulent claims, using some of the funds to purchase cryptocurrency, Thompson said. Federal officials say he fled the country after receiving a subpoena.",
      "The five charged include two Philadelphia residents who have been accused of \"fraud tourism\" after they registered as Minnesota providers, Thompson said, adding that for them the scheme was \"easy money.\"",
      "\"Minnesota has become a magnet for fraud, so much so that we have developed a fraud tourism industry \u2013 people coming to our state purely to exploit and defraud its programs,\" Thompson said. \"This is a deeply unsettling reality that all Minnesotans should understand.\"",
      "The two men, Anthony Waddel Jefferson and Lester Brown, were accused of siphoning millions from federally funded programs administered by Minnesota officials that were meant to help the disabled and those suffering from addiction, according to court filings.",
      "They allegedly fleeced the housing program in Minnesota despite \"living on the other side of the country and having no network in or connections to Minnesota or its communities,\" the filings stated.",
      "They join eight others charged in September for their alleged roles in the scheme to defraud the\u00a0Minnesota Housing Stability Services Program.",
      "Prosecutors also named a new defendant accused of defrauding another state-run, federally funded program that provides services for children with autism, alleging he submitted millions of dollars worth of claims for Medicaid reimbursement. One woman previously charged for exploiting that program pleaded guilty Thursday morning, officials said.",
      "Asked who is to blame, Thompson said the state \"has not done a good job of mining these programs.\"",

      "Prosecutors allege that Guerrero Flores, 42, known by the nicknames \"The Unspeakable\" or \"The Big Eyebrow,\" ran the multinational crime syndicate for more than a decade, growing the organization from a prison-based gang into a terrorist organization responsible for drug trafficking and violence worldwide. He is charged with participating in a racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and cocaine importation conspiracy, among other charges.",

D'Ambrosio said\u00a0in a statement. \"He ran this empire from prison, shielded by corruption, and in collaboration with a narco-state cartel intent on flooding the United States with cocaine.\"",

Patel said in a statement that the leader \"grew TdA from a Venezuela-based prison gang to the vile, vicious organization it has become.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Kennedy Center's Board of Trustees voted to rename the performing arts institution the Trump-Kennedy Center, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "\"I have just been informed that the highly respected Board of the Kennedy Center, some of the most successful people from all parts of the world, have just voted unanimously to rename the Kennedy Center to the Trump-Kennedy Center, because of the unbelievable work President Trump has done over the last year in saving the building. Not only from the standpoint of its reconstruction, but also financially, and its reputation,\" Leavitt wrote on X.",
      "Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, confirmed the vote by the board to name the performing arts institution The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.",
      "\"The unanimous vote recognizes that the current Chairman saved the institution from financial ruin and physical destruction,\" Daravi said in a statement. \"The new Trump Kennedy Center reflects the unequivocal bipartisan support for America's cultural center for generations to come.\"",
      "By Thursday afternoon, the Kennedy Center website had updated its logo to read \"The Trump Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to put his stamp\u00a0on the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts soon after he returned to the White House for his second term. He removed Democratic-appointed members of its board and installed his allies and administration officials to the panel. The board also consists of local and federal officials, as well as members of the House and Senate from both parties. Trustees serve six-year terms.",
      "Richard Grenell, who worked in the first Trump administration, serves as the Kennedy Center's president. The board in February selected Mr. Trump to serve as its chairman.",
      "Among the members appointed by the president are White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and second lady Usha Vance.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that he was \"honored\" and \"surprised\" by the vote, and praised the board as \"very distinguished.\"",
      "\"We're saving the building. We saved the building,\" he said. \"Now it's very solid, very strong.\"",
      "Rep. Joyce Beatty, an Ohio Democrat who serves on the Board of Trustees, disputed that the vote to rename the Kennedy Center was unanimous, as Leavitt said. She wrote on X\u00a0that she \"was muted on the call and not allowed to speak or voice my opposition to this move. Also for the record, this was not on the agenda.\"",
      "\"Clearly the Congress has a say in this,\" she said in a video shared to X. \"This center, The Kennedy Center, was created by the Congress. I think it's important for us to know that this is just another attempt to evade the law and not let the people have a say.\"",
      "Kennedy's niece, Maria Shriver, blasted the move in a lengthy social media post, writing that it was \"beyond comprehension that this sitting president has sought to rename this great memorial dedicated to President Kennedy. It is beyond wild that he would think adding his name in front of President Kennedy's name is acceptable. It is not.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the move.",
      "\"Beyond using the Kennedy Center to reward his friends and political allies, President Trump is now attempting to affix his name to yet another public institution without legal authority,\" Schumer and several other Democrats who serve as ex officio board members said in a statement. \"This whole process displays the corruption that permeates the entire Trump Administration.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had pledged to make \"a lot of changes\" to the Kennedy Center, \"including the seats, the decor, pretty much everything.\"",
      "The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts was established by Congress as the national center for performing arts and a living memorial to the late President John F. Kennedy and opened its doors in 1971. It recognizes achievements in music, theater and dance each year with its honors ceremony. The Kennedy Center Honors, which Mr. Trump hosted, was broadcast on CBS television stations and\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0earlier this month.",
      "The law establishing the Kennedy Center restricts \"additional memorials or plaques in the nature of memorials\" to be designated or installed.",
      "Because the Kennedy Center was created by Congress, any change to its name would appear to require approval from lawmakers. Still, Mr. Trump from sought to unilaterally make sweeping changes to other federal entities that would require congressional action.",
      "The president in September signed an executive order to begin the process of renaming the Department of Defense to the Department of War. The directive allowed the Pentagon to start using Department of War as a \"secondary title\" and let Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth use the title of secretary of war.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in March that sought to dismantle the Department of Education. Fully eliminating the agency would require an act of Congress.",

    "story": [
      "Seven people on a business jet that crashed Thursday at Statesville Regional Airport in North Carolina have died, the State Highway Patrol said. NASCAR driver Greg Biffle, 55, his wife Cristina and their children were among those on the plane, NASCAR and North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson said.",
      "In a statement, NASCAR said the organization is devastated by \"the tragic loss of Greg Biffle, his wife Cristina, daughter Emma, son Ryder, Craig Wadsworth and Dennis and Jack Dutton in a fatal plane crash.\"",
      "Families of the passengers listed by NASCAR released a joint statement saying, \"We are devastated by the loss of our loved ones. This tragedy has left all of our families heartbroken beyond words.\" NASCAR didn't provide further information on the people named in its statement beyond the Biffle family, to which they offered their \"deepest condolences.\"",
      "The North Carolina State Highway Patrol said it believes Biffle and members of his immediate family were on the plane, but that it would be able to provide a list of the occupants once it has that information from the medical examiner's office.",
      "Garrett Mitchell, a race car driver and YouTuber, said Biffle and his family had boarded the Cessna to \"spend the afternoon\" with him. \"We are devastated,\" Mitchell wrote in a\u00a0Facebook post.",
      "Plane had departed and was returning to airport on reapproach, authorities say",
      "The Cessna C550 crashed while landing at the airport around 10:20 a.m. Thursday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. A\u00a0picture of the plane showed it engulfed in a large fire.",
      "A flight path available on FlightAware, a flight tracking website, appears to show that the plane departed, then looped back toward the airport. North Carolina State Highway Patrol confirmed that the plane had departed and was returning to the airport on reapproach, but did not give a reason.",
      "Flight tracking records show that the Cessna 550 that departed from Statesville Regional Airport is owned by a private North Carolina company, according to WBTV. The private company is affiliated with Biffle, the station reported, citing business records. The North Carolina State Highway Patrol said the plane is registered to GB Aviation Leasing.",
      "In a social media post, the airport confirmed there was an \"aircraft incident\" and said the FAA was en route to investigate. The airport is closed under further notice, airport director John Ferguson said.",
      "Ferguson said it would \"take some time to get the debris off the runway to get it safe again.\" He added that the airport had no information about what caused the crash. AccuWeather said there were clouds and some drizzle at the time.",
      "The Statesville Regional Airport, which is about 45 minutes north of Charlotte, provides corporate aviation facilities for Fortune 500 companies and several NASCAR teams, the airport says on its website.",
      "Golfers playing next to the airport were shocked as they witnessed the disaster, even dropping to the ground at the Lakewood Golf Club while the plane was overhead. The ninth hole was covered with debris.",
      "\"We were like, 'Oh my gosh! That's way too low,'\" Joshua Green of Mooresville said. \"It was scary.\"",
      "The plane had planned to fly later from Sarasota, Florida, to Treasure Cay International Airport in the Bahamas before returning to Fort Lauderdale and then back to Statesville by the evening, according to data posted by FlightAware.",
      "Racing community, others react to Biffle family deaths",
      "A NASCAR veteran who first drew attention in the league in 1995, Biffle went on to have a decorated racing career and was named one of NASCAR's 75 Greatest Drivers, according to the\u00a0NASCAR Hall of Fame, to which Biffle also received a nomination.",
      "Tributes from the racing community and others came pouring in throughout the day. NASCAR said, \"Greg was more than a champion driver; he was a beloved member of the NASCAR community, a fierce competitor, and a friend to so many. His passion for racing, his integrity, and his commitment to fans and fellow competitors alike made a lasting impact on the sport.\"",
      "Fellow racer Brad Keselowski said he \"gained deep respect for him [Biffle] not only as a champion on the racetrack, but as a competitor who helped define an era of NASCAR.\" Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, where Biffle raced for many years,\u00a0said, \"All of us at RFK Racing are devastated by the heartbreaking news involving the Biffle family. Greg Biffle has long been a cherished member of our racing family. As a person, family man, and driver, his accomplishments helped form a cornerstone of our organization.\"",
      "Rep. Hudson wrote\u00a0on X: \"Greg was a great NASCAR champion who thrilled millions of fans. But he was an extraordinary person as well, and will be remembered for his service to others as much as for his fearlessness on the track.\"",
      "Biffle and his wife were devoted parents \"whose lives were centered around their young son Ryder and Greg's daughter Emma,\" the family statement reads.",
      "Ryder was an \"active, curious and infinitely joyful child,\" while Emma, who Biffle shared with her mother, Nicole Lunders, was a \"kind soul who was loved by many people.\"",
      "The statement said Dennis Dutton and his son Jack were \"deeply loved,\" and Craig Wadsworth was \"beloved by many\" in the NASCAR community.",
      "\"We ask for privacy, compassion and understanding as we grieve and begin to process this unimaginable loss,\" the statement reads.",

In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two armed accomplices steal $350 from people in a home in 2002.

      "Instacart has agreed to refund $60 million to customers to settle allegations that the grocery shopping service engaged in deceptive marketing and billing practices, the Federal Trade Commission\u00a0said Thursday.",
      "The agency alleged in a lawsuit that Instacart charged hidden fees and refused to issue refunds, raising the cost of groceries for consumers and harming shoppers.",
      "\"Instacart misled consumers by advertising free delivery services \u2014 and then charging consumers to have groceries delivered \u2014 and failing to disclose to consumers that signed up for a free trial that they would be automatically enrolled into its subscription program,\" Christopher Mufarrige, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "The FTC said Instacart's promise of free delivery to shoppers placing an order through the platform for the first time amounted to false advertising because the offer required that they pay a \"service fee\" to receive their groceries.",
      "Instacart also failed to stand behind its \"100% satisfaction guarantee\" because it implied that it offered full refunds for dissatisfied customers, which the company failed to provide, regulators allege. Instead, customers whose orders were late or incomplete only received a small credit to use on a future order.",
      "Instacart denied the FTC's allegations, telling CBS News in a statement that the company provides \"straightforward marketing, transparent pricing and fees, clear terms, easy cancellation, and generous refund policies \u2014 all in full compliance with the law and exceeding industry norms.\"",

    "summary": "House Democrats called for GOP leaders to hold a last-minute vote on extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Democrats called on GOP leaders to hold a last-minute vote on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits on Thursday as lawmakers are poised to head home for the holidays without addressing the expiring subsidies.",
      "\"We're demanding a vote today on extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits today \u2014 not tomorrow, not next week, not next month \u2014 today,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said.",
      "Around 22 million Americans who purchase their health insurance through Affordable Care Act exchanges face a steep premium increase in the new year with the expiration of the enhanced tax credits on Dec. 31. And despite weeks of debate on Capitol Hill over the issue, which was at the center of the shutdown fight that ended last month, lawmakers have been unable to reach a resolution.",
      "Speaking alongside House Democrats on the steps of the Capitol on Thursday morning, Jeffries and his leadership team cited his discharge petition, which reached the 218-signature threshold needed to force a vote on the tax credits a day earlier. Four moderate Republicans signed onto the petition\u00a0Wednesday after days of back and forth on the GOP health care strategy, breaking with their party leadership to back the measure.",
      "\"We have the votes, we have the momentum,\" Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar said. \"We have the American people on our side. Let's not waste another second.\"",
      "But even with the success of the petition, a vote on extending the ACA tax credits isn't expected until the chamber reconvenes in January, since seven legislative days must elapse before a discharge motion can be brought to the floor. House Speaker Mike Johnson called it a \"rule that cannot be broken.\"",
      "\"That's the rule,\" Johnson said Wednesday. \"There's no way around that.\"",
      "Still, Democrats urged Johnson to act sooner. \"Under no circumstances should the House of Representatives adjourn until we successfully extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits for tens of millions of Americans,\" Jeffries said.",
      "Johnson does have the authority to move the process along. Last month, when another small group of Republicans broke with their leaders to sign onto a discharge petition to force the Justice Department to release the Epstein files, Johnson moved quickly to hold a vote on the underlying bill.",
      "But the speaker indicated that Republicans don't intend to address the health care issue until the new year. Johnson told reporters Wednesday that the measure will be considered during the first week of January upon the House's return, calling it \"inevitable.\" He added that Republicans plan to hold additional votes on their health care policies when they return.",
      "\"We'll be back in January to do much more of this,\" Johnson said.",
      "House GOP leaders canceled votes for Friday after the chamber on Wednesday approved a health care bill that Republicans say would lower health insurance premiums for Americans, but does not include an extension of the expiring ACA tax credits.",
      "Jeffries was asked Thursday afternoon whether he would consider supporting other bipartisan proposals to extend the credits with reforms, if the three-year extension makes it out of the House but fails in the Senate.",
      "\"The House has to work its will first,\" he replied. \"Once the House works its will \u2014 which should be taking place today, tomorrow, before the end of the year, but at least as early as when we get back in January \u2014 then we'll send the bill over to the Senate. And we'll see what the senators decide to do. We're not giving up this fight.\"",
      "Though imminent action appears out of the question, the movement on the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. After a meeting between so-called \"problem solvers\" in both the House and Senate on Wednesday, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle expressed optimism about a solution.",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, told CBS News that the discharge petition in the House \"gives momentum to the bipartisan work that we've been trying to advance on the Senate side.\" She said she expects health care discussions will continue between both chambers over the holiday break. And the discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should moderate lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "In the upper chamber, senators rejected a clean three-year extension of the enhanced ACA tax credits just last week. But a number of Republicans have expressed interest in extending the credits, as long as some reforms are made to the program.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune Wednesday to bring up the extension if it passes the House.",
      "Schumer noted that every Democrat voted for a three-year extension last week. He added that if the measure passes the House, \"we hope Thune would put it on the floor and let it pass.\"",
      "Thune was noncommittal about whether the Senate would take up a bill to extend the ACA subsidies for three years if it passes the House, noting Wednesday morning to reporters that he didn't expect a vote this week.",
      "Last month, the Senate quickly approved a bill to force the release of the Epstein files after a discharge petition prompted a vote in the House. But Thune told reporters that the Epstein and health care issues are \"very different,\" predicting that while the Epstein measure had near unanimous support in the lower chamber, the health care vote would likely be a partisan one.",
      "Meanwhile, President Trump reiterated his support for sending funds \"directly to the people\" to buy their own health care on Thursday, suggesting that the change could implemented rapidly to address health care costs.",
      "On the rising premiums that millions of Americans face in the new year with the expiration of the ACA tax credits, the president said \"they will skyrocket because it was never any good.\"",

    "summary": "An FBI media adviser has emerged as one of Kash Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the bureau under his leadership.",
    "story": [
      "FBI Director Kash Patel was enduring yet another round of negative headlines in October about his frequent use of the FBI's private jet \u2013 this time to see his girlfriend sing the national anthem at a freestyle wrestling event in State College, Pennsylvania.",
      "An FBI spokesman pushed back on the criticism, citing federal regulations requiring the FBI director to fly on government aircraft. But the most passionate retort came from a little-known FBI media adviser who has emerged as one of Patel's fiercest public defenders and promoters of the FBI under his leadership.",
      "\"Shaming a woman the Director has happily dated for nearly three years is pathetic and, frankly, disgusting,\" Erica Knight wrote on X. \"Hot take \u2013 when someone's arrested 28,000 violent criminals and taken millions in drugs off the streets, maybe we can also support their happiness.\"",
      "It was a heartfelt but strikingly personal response from a law enforcement agency known for its buttoned-up communications style. But Knight is not the typical government spokeswoman. She's Patel's friend and longtime personal publicist, hired earlier this year to help shake up the bureau's communications strategy. She's also amplified the director's public messaging and touted what the FBI leadership sees as its successes.",
      "In one testament to their friendship, shortly after he was sworn in as FBI director, Patel posted a picture of himself in the Oval Office with Knight and wrote on X: \"I have been truly blessed to have the best captain and teammate @_ericaKnight \u2013 she has been there since day 1, without her I would not be in this position today. She is the best publicist in America, an absolute force.\"",
      "Glowing public testimonials like this have left some current and former FBI agents questioning Knight's taxpayer-funded role, especially since the FBI already has a sprawling media department.",
      "Those questions have surfaced amid growing concerns inside the agency. Two bureau sources tell CBS News that they believe Patel is using public resources in ways that push the boundaries of traditionally accepted FBI practice. Beyond the trips to visit his girlfriend, Patel has used FBI aircraft to go to sporting events \u2014 a golf outing in Scotland with friends and a trip to a private hunting reserve in Texas owned by the family of a GOP donor.",
      "He's also been slammed by critics for assigning FBI SWAT agents to protect his girlfriend, country music performer Alexis Wilkins, at taxpayer expense. (Wilkins has said she has been the target of multiple death threats since Patel became FBI director.)",
      "FBI officials say Patel reimburses the government for his personal flights and point out that federal regulations require him to use government aircraft for both personal and official travel. Nevertheless, Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, recently announced a probe into Patel's use of public resources and is demanding he turn over documents related to the trips.",
      "Now, Raskin tells CBS News, he has questions about Patel's PR arrangement with Knight. Raskin has called on the FBI to disclose how much she is being paid.",
      "\"Why should an FBI Director have to hire a taxpayer-funded PR fixer to spin away public criticism,\" Raskin said in an email to CBS News. \"And if there's nothing to hide, then the bureau should have no problem releasing Ms. Knight's contract, showing exactly how much the American taxpayers are paying for her crisis PR services.\"",
      "FBI officials vigorously push back against the criticism, maintaining that Knight's job is not about tending to Patel's personal PR. Rather, they say she works closely in tandem with the Office of Public Affairs to promote the bureau's broader mission. In an interview with CBS News, a senior FBI official who asked not to be named called the notion that she serves only the director \"entirely false.\"",
      "\"She is not a PR representative for the director,\" the official said. \"She does specific work related to FBI communications.\"",
      "Still, a number of news outlets, including the New Yorker, CNN, Scripps News and Fox News, identified Knight in their reports as Patel's spokesperson or his adviser.",
      "Inside the agency, speculation about how much she's being paid has been widespread. Typically, such contracts are public, but the agency declined a request from CBS News for details of Knight's compensation, and Knight, in an interview, also declined to disclose information about her salary.",
      "\"The FBI absolutely needs to be more forward-leaning and transparent in terms of its communications,\" said Chris O'Leary, a former senior FBI agent. \"But Patel appears to be putting the spotlight on himself, rather than on the institution \u2013 at taxpayer expense.\"",
      "Federal salaries are typically public information. Knight, who works from outside of Washington, is not a federal employee but rather a contractor \u2013 an arrangement that makes it harder to determine her actual compensation. Her direct employer is Xpect Solutions, a technology and security services firm. The FBI has been a long-time customer of Xpect Solutions, and sources familiar with the arrangement say Knight's salary is paid to the company out of the FBI Office of Public Affairs budget. Xpect Solutions did not respond to a request for comment about Knight's employment.",
      "Ben Williamson, the FBI's assistant director for public affairs, told CBS News that Knight's contract with the FBI is \"entirely consistent with procurement rules and ethical guidelines, and any suggestion otherwise from CBS or elsewhere says more about their lack of basic research than it does anything else.\"",
      "Williamson said he and Knight, who reports both to him and Patel, speak daily. He described her as \"a valuable member of our press and communications office and one of the best operatives I've worked with in a decade.\"",
      "Patel met Knight after he left the first Trump administration in 2021 \u2013 the two were introduced by a mutual friend, according to a source familiar with the relationship. Knight was a publicist and crisis communications specialist with a growing client list; and Patel was on a mission to raise his profile.",
      "With Knight's help, Patel flooded the media with cable news and podcast appearances, lucrative speeches and book events, all aimed at cheering on the MAGA agenda and defending Donald Trump.",
      "The effort helped put him on the short list for FBI director, and when he was selected to the post, Knight came along.",
      "Since joining the government PR team, Knight has become a relentless champion of her client, touting the FBI's law-and-order accomplishments (\"President Trump's administration and Director Patel's FBI are dismantling the cartels and crushing the fentanyl crisis,\" she posted on X last month).",
      "In some ways, the role is not new \u2013 the FBI has long had a vast PR operation \u2014 one FBI source said there are well over 150\u00a0 staff in the bureau's office of public affairs, with 60 or so working out of headquarters in Washington and the rest in the bureau's 56 field offices. J. Edgar Hoover's vaunted publicity machine occupied a whole wing of bureau headquarters.",
      "For his part, Robert Mueller, a former FBI director, Marine and federal prosecutor, had little time for mingling with reporters and had no social media presence.",
      "James Comey, according to one of his advisers, believed more public engagement was critical to restoring trust in the FBI. Comey hired a law professor and friend, Daniel Richman, as a special government employee who worked on multiple projects for Comey, among them, interacting occasionally with reporters on sensitive investigations.",
      "Patel's immediate predecessor as FBI director, Christopher Wray, was so reticent about putting himself in the spotlight that agents often grumbled that he wasn't aggressive enough in defending the bureau. One close adviser alleged that he regularly admonished agents, \"Be a workhorse, not a show horse.\"",
      "Knight, in an interview, said the FBI's more aggressive public PR strategy aligns with Patel's avowed efforts to be a disruptor at the hidebound agency.",
      "\"Kash and [co-Deputy Director] Dan [Bongiono] were not hired to do business as usual,\" Knight said in an interview. \"They wanted to change the way things were done, help make the American people safe, and restore trust in the FBI. I don't think you can do that without communicating.\"",
      "Those who have interacted with her say Knight is skilled at cultivating relationships with reporters covering Patel. She has a reputation for being responsive to their questions and providing accurate information, even as she pushes for more favorable coverage of Patel.",
      "Her close relationship and direct access to Patel allow her to channel his views or get his personal reaction to the stories they're working on. One reporter called her \"the Kash whisperer.\"",
      "Knight, according to sources familiar with her role, works with Williamson to draft statements under Patel's name, and his talking points for interviews and his posts on X, where he remains a prolific poster.",
      "Knight has represented other clients in the MAGA world, too.",
      "\"Erica is a powerhouse,\" said Alina Habba, who until recently had been serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, but stepped down after a federal appeals court ruled that she was unlawfully appointed. Habba hired Knight when she was serving as a private defense lawyer for Donald Trump. Even before Patel completes his first year in the job, supporters and critics say it is hard to dispute the notion that he has been a disruptor, for better or worse.",
      "Patel's supporters say he's dragging the FBI into a new media age, one dominated by social media. And for that, Erica Knight has been there for every step \u2014 and every social media post.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday announced that U.S. service members will receive a $1,776 bonus, which he called a \"warrior dividend,\" before Christmas.",
      "Mr. Trump, who announced the plan in a White House address billed as focusing on affordability, said the amount was inspired by the year of the nation's founding.",
      "The money is \"to both thank them for their military service and to commemorate the 250 years the U.S. military has been defending the nation,\" the White House said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Here's what to know about the dividend.",
      "Is it a recurring bonus?",
      "The \"warrior dividend\" is a one-time pay bump for the nation's 1.45 million\u00a0military service members, according to the White House.",
      "\"1776; as you know, our great nation was founded in the crucible of revolution in that year,\" U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said in a social media video posted Thursday.",
      "\"As he announced to the nation last night, thanks to President Trump's unwavering commitment to our warriors and the provisions provided in the One Big, Beautiful Bill, more than 1.45 million service members will, in the coming days, receive a one-time tax-free bonus of $1,776,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The checks will be tax-free because they are being paid as a one-time basic allowance for housing supplement, The Hill\u00a0reported. The IRS\u00a0says\u00a0that such housing payments are considered a military benefit and are excluded from taxable income.",
      "Who gets a $1,776 check?",
      "Active duty service members who fell under the pay grades of O-6 or below as of Nov. 30 are eligible for the checks. Reserve component service members on active duty orders of 31 days as of that same date also qualify for the payments, according to the White House.",
      "In the Army, Marine Corps and Air Force, that includes people with the officer rank of colonel or below. For the Navy and Coast Guard, it includes those with the rank of captain or below.",
      "Active duty officers with an O-6 pay grade and two years of experience or less earn $8,340.90 a month, according to 2025 military pay charts. O-1 officers with the same amount of experience earn $3,998.40 monthly.",
      "When will the warrior dividend be paid?",
      "Military members are expected to receive their bonuses \"in the coming days,\" according to the White House.",
      "\"The checks are already on the way,\" Mr. Trump said from the White House on Wednesday. \"Nobody deserves it more than our military, and I say, 'congratulations' to everybody.\"",
      "In its statement on Thursday, the White House said service members can expect to receive the payments before Dec. 20.",
      "How is the dividend funded?",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump suggested the \"warrior dividend\" payments are being funded both by his administration's tariffs and the\u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he signed into law this summer.",
      "The payments, which are expected to total $2.6 billion, will come from a $2.9 billion appropriation to the military in the new tax and spending law, a senior administration official told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't immediately return a request for comment about whether tariff revenue will also be directed to the fund the \"warrior dividend\" payments.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 14:38:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Thursday unveiled a series of regulatory actions designed to effectively ban gender-affirming care for minors, building on broader Trump administration restrictions on transgender Americans.",
      "The sweeping proposals include cutting off federal Medicaid and Medicare funding from hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to children and prohibiting federal Medicaid dollars from being used to fund such procedures.",
      "\"This is not medicine, it is malpractice,\" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said of gender-affirming procedures on children in a news conference on Thursday. \"Sex-rejecting procedures rob children of their futures.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements mark the most significant moves the administration has taken to restrict the use of puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgical interventions for transgender children. They would imperil access in nearly two dozen states where drug treatments and surgical procedures remain legal and funded by Medicaid, which includes federal and state dollars.",
      "The proposals run counter to the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations. And advocates for transgender children strongly refuted the administration's claims about gender-affirming care and said Thursday's moves would put lives at risk.",
      "\"The multitude of efforts we are seeing from federal legislators to strip transgender and nonbinary youth of the health care they need is deeply troubling,\" said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, of The Trevor Project, a nonprofit suicide prevention organization for LBGTQ+ youth, who called the changes a \"one-size-fits-all mandate from the federal government\" on a decision that should be between a doctor and patient.",
      "Medicaid programs in slightly less than half of states currently cover gender-affirming care. At least 27 states have adopted laws restricting or banning the care.",
      "The Supreme Court's recent decision upholding Tennessee's ban means most other state laws are likely to remain in place. Tennessee's law, known as SB1, prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. As CBS News previously reported, Tennessee argued that it had a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The proposals announced by Kennedy and his deputies are not final or legally binding. The federal government must go through a lengthy rulemaking process, including periods of public comment and document rewrites, before the restrictions becoming permanent. They are also likely to face legal challenges.",
      "But the proposed rules will likely further intimidate health care providers from offering gender-affirming care to children and many hospitals have already ceased such care in anticipation of federal action.",
      "Nearly all U.S. hospitals participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the federal government's largest health plans that cover seniors, people with disabilities and low-income Americans. Losing access to those payments would imperil most U.S. hospitals and medical providers.",
      "The same funding restrictions would apply to a smaller health program, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, when it comes to care for people under the age of 19, according to a federal notice posted Thursday morning.",
      "Kennedy also announced Thursday that the HHS Office of Civil Rights will propose a rule excluding gender dysphoria from the definition of a disability.",
      "In a related move, the Food and Drug Administration issued warning letters to a dozen companies that market chest-binding vests and other equipment used by people with gender dysphoria. Manufacturers include GenderBender LLC of Carson, California and TomboyX of Seattle. The FDA letters state that chest binders can only be legally marketed for FDA-approved medical uses, such as recovery after mastectomy surgery.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, on Thursday called transgender treatments \"a Band-Aid on a much deeper pathology,\" and suggested children with gender dysphoria are \"confused, lost and need help.\"",
      "Polling shows many Americans agree with the administration's view of the issue. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in May found that about half of U.S. adults approved of how Trump was handling transgender issues.",
      "Chloe Cole, a conservative activist known for speaking about her gender-transition reversal, spoke at the news conference to express appreciation. She said cries for help from her and others in her situation, \"have finally been heard.\"",
      "But the approach contradicts the recommendations of most major U.S. medical organizations, including the American Medical Association, which has urged states not to restrict care for gender dysphoria.",
      "\"In an effort to strongarm hospitals into participating in the administration's anti-LGBTQ agenda, the Trump Administration is forcing health care systems to choose between providing lifesaving care for LGBTQ+ young people and accepting crucial federal funding,\" Dr. Jamila Perritt, a Washington-based OB/GYN and president and CEO of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said in a statement.",
      "\"This is a lose-lose situation where lives are inevitably on the line. \"",
      "The announcements build on a wave of actions President Trump, his administration and Republicans in Congress have taken to target the rights of transgender people nationwide.",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that declared the federal government would recognize only two immutable sexes: male and female. He also has signed orders aimed at cutting off federal support for gender transitions for people under age 19 and barring transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "On Wednesday, a bill that would open transgender health care providers to prison time if they treat people under the age of 18 passed the U.S. House and heads to the Senate. Another bill under consideration in the House on Thursday aims to ban Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for children.",
      "Young people who persistently identify as a gender that differs from their sex assigned at birth are first evaluated by a team of professionals. Some may try a social transition, involving changing a hairstyle or pronouns. Some may later also receive hormone-blocking drugs that delay puberty, followed by testosterone or estrogen to bring about the desired physical changes in patients. Surgery is rare for minors.",

    "story": [
      "Some small business owners say they are facing their own affordability crisis because of higher tariff, health insurance and energy costs.",
      "Shirley Modlin, who owns 3D Design and Manufacturing in Powhatan, Virginia, told CBS News that rising operational expenses are making it tough for her to offer raises and health insurance for her 10 workers.",
      "Modlin, whose company makes metal parts for the automotive, pharmaceutical, beverage and other industries, said uncertainty over where U.S. tariff rates will settle makes it hard to forecast her costs.",
      "\"It's the end of the year and my employees are expecting some kind of raise, but I don't know how much I can give them because I don't know what kind of impact the tariffs are going to continue to have on me,\" Modlin told CBS News.",
      "\"I feel like I am in a balancing act, and if I don't raise prices and my costs are going up, that squeezes my margins harder,\" she added.",
      "U.S. importers currently face an average effective tariff rate of 16.8%, the highest level since the 1930s, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a nonpartisan policy research center.",
      "Small business importers paid roughly $25,000 more per month on average due to the Trump administration's tariffs between April and September, compared to the same period in 2024, according to a\u00a0new analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP), a nonpartisan policy research institute.",
      "\"What should be a season of giving has become a season of paying for America's 36 million small businesses,\" Sen. Ed Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, said at a press conference on Tuesday held by the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \"They are paying more for affordable health care, more for electricity and more for just about everything, thanks to Trump's tariffs.\"",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the legality\u00a0of Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs soon. If they are struck down, however, he has other tools he can employ to implement similar levies, according to legal experts.",
      "Who's to blame?",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship blamed small businesses' challenges on Democrats.",
      "\"Four years of Democrat control of Washington created a historic affordability crisis for small businesses as inflation soared and an unprecedented $1.8 trillion in new regulations were created,\" the spokesperson told CBS News. \"In just 11 months, Republicans have begun to undo the damage by passing the largest tax cut in history to complement the $907 billion regulatory rollback being undertaken by the Trump administration.",
      "\"The results speak for themselves as we just witnessed a record number of holiday shoppers, core inflation fell to the lowest level in five years, and hardworking Americans' real wages will increase by $1,000,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Spokespersons for the White House and Small Business Administration didn't respond to a request for comment on the affordability concerns cited by some small businesses.",
      "Another major concern for Modlin and her workers is that enhanced tax credits for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) are set to expire at the end of 2025, which experts have said would sharply drive up premiums for more than 20 million Americans.",
      "An October CAP\u00a0analysis found that 4.4 million small business owners and self-employed Americans will see their health insurance costs rise by an average of $1,500 if the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire.",
      "In 2024, Modlin offered employees a $350 monthly stipend to help offset health plan costs. Now, she said she's trying to decide whether to increase that monthly payment or offer raises. She can't afford to do both, said Modlin, expressing concern about losing some of her machinists to larger competitors.",
      "\"I've interviewed job candidates who have said they need a better health insurance benefit,\" she said. \"The rest of our benefits are good, but I just can't keep up with the cost of insurance.\"",
      "Julie Robbins, CEO of Earthquaker Devices, an Akron, Ohio-based maker of guitar pedals and other musical effects products, said the 35-person company's costs have soared about 30% this year because of the sharply higher U.S. tariffs on imports.",
      "She and her husband, with whom she runs the business, purchase thousands of components sourced from more than a dozen countries to manufacture pedals in Ohio. The company has paid an additional $60,000 in tariffs this year, a figure that could rise to at least $180,000 in 2026, Robbins said at the Senate small business event held earlier this week.",
      "Robbins said Earthquaker plans to modestly hike its prices starting in January, noting that the company's suppliers have lifted their own prices. She acknowledges that such increases could scare away some customers.",
      "\"You can't calculate how demand will suffer from a price rise, so we try to avoid that whenever possible,\" Robbins told CBS News.",
      "In November, 34% of small businesses raised their average selling prices, an unusually sharp jump from previous months, according to Bank of America analysts, citing recent data from the National Federation of Independent Business.",

      "As the search entered its fifth day, authorities have so far been unable to identify the person of interest in the shooting that killed\u00a0two students\u00a0and wounded nine others over the weekend. Police on Wednesday also released a map of the area showing the streets where they say a person of interest is confirmed to have been on Saturday, the day of the shooting.",
      "Police on Wednesday also\u00a0asked for the public's help\u00a0in identifying someone who they say was seen in the area near the person of interest, so they could speak to him. Providence Police Chief Col. Oscar Perez  said the person investigators want to speak to appeared to have come near the person of interest at the corner of Benevolent and Cooke streets. In a video released by police, the person of interest appeared to suddenly stop and turn around as he approached the corner.",
      "\"I want to urge you, the public, not to rely on AI generated images that are currently being shared on social media,\" Perez warned at a news conference on Wednesday afternoon. \"The updates and information you're getting will be provided exclusively through this department's social channels.\"",
      "When asked by a reporter if \"any items of interest\" have been found during the search so far, specifically clothing, Perez responded \"nothing as we speak, no.\"",
      "In order to avoid any misinformation, Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said police have created a page on the department's website where all the digital evidence is currently published.",
      "Two of the wounded victims have so far been treated and released from the hospital, according to Smiley. One person remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition, and five others are in stable condition. The ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries.",
      "Several videos of a person of interest in the case were released earlier this week. They show what police say are \"enhanced\" images captured on the East Side of Providence on Saturday afternoon, approximately two hours before the shooting.",
      "The person of interest, who is wearing a face covering, is seen walking on a sidewalk and looking around \u2014 but it does not clearly show where the person went afterward, police said.",
      "\"At this point it's unknown to us where this person works, it's unknown to us if he was an affiliate of Brown, that's all unknown to us,\" Perez said.",
      "Perez also confirmed Wednesday that only one weapon was used. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha then interrupted a reporter's question about the gun, saying that certain details about the case don't advance the investigation if they're released to the public.",
      "\"As we interview witnesses, we don't want them to learn facts from these press conferences. We want them to relay the facts they have in their heads,\" Neronha said. \"We're being careful about the facts that we're sharing for that reason.\"",

      "Some of the footage released Tuesday by the Providence Police Department on social media appeared to be digitally enhanced versions of previously released videos. Police urged anyone with information to contact the FBI tip line online or at 401-272-3121.",
      "\"Even small details may be critical to this,\" police said.",
      "A source briefed on the investigation told CBS News the lack of usable surveillance video is significantly hampering the search for the shooter. That limitation is key reason police widened their request for video and photos on Wednesday to large perimeter around Brown University's campus.",
      "Investigators are specifically looking for footage that could show the suspect entering a vehicle, apartment, or residence in the moments after the shooting. An image released earlier Tuesday, though blurry, was the clearest picture of the person of interest released so far since the shooting on Saturday.",
      "The FBI said the person of interest is about 5-foot-8 with a stocky build. The agency has also shared a timeline of when the videos were captured, including some videos that appear to have been obtained from residents' private cameras. The person of interest is seen from about 2 p.m. on Saturday until just after 4 p.m., around the time the shooting took place.",
      "Police said the individual was walking near Hope and Benevolent streets, just down the block from the Barus & Holley engineering building where the gunman opened fire. Authorities said Monday they had no information about a motive at this point.",

      "\"We were in a state where Brown felt incredibly safe, and that bubble of safeness was completely popped when we were violated by a shooter entering our campus,\" Levine said. \"I think it will take time and effort to be able to rebuild any sense of normalcy among students.\"",
      "Another student, sophomore Aurna Mukherjee, said she had originally planned to go to an exam review session that was being held where the shooting occurred, but decided to study in her dorm instead.",
      "\"Getting the text from Brown saying there's an active shooter, if you see them run, hide, felt dystopian to me,\" Mukherjee told CBS News, saying she went to hide in her friend's room and barricaded herself there because there was an issue with her door. \"I never imagined being in a position where I would be having to hide from an active shooter on campus.\"",
      "With final exams canceled, the majority of students had left campus by Monday. But those who remained were on alert, given that the shooter had not been caught.",
      "\"I think everyone is really scared right now. And, and I think that there is a lot of fear,\" Eno Thomson-Tribe, a friend of one of the slain students, 18-year-old freshman\u00a0Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, told CBS News. \"To know that this person is still on the loose ... is very scary.\"",
      "Thomson-Tribe described Umurzokov, whose family migrated from Uzbekistan when he was young, as \"magnetic,\" caring and supportive of his friends.",
      "The other student who was killed, a 19-year-old sophomore from Alabama named\u00a0Ella Cook, was remembered by Alabama Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth as a \"devoted Christian and a committed conservative who represented the very best of Alabama. A bright future was ended much too soon.\"",
      "Police on Monday released several\u00a0videos of a person of interest, but a suspect has not been identified. Authorities say they do not believe there is any immediate threat to Brown or the local community.",
      "Despite increased police presence, Mukherjee said it will take some time for students to feel safe again.",
      "\"I am struggling to envision how we would go back to campus and go get a matcha or explore restaurants on Thayer Street the way we did before. I am sure at some point we'll get closer to that,\" Mukherjee said.",

      "Update: Police said Sunday that a person of interest in the shooting was detained overnight, but that person was later released after questioning. Read more here. Our earlier coverage is below.",
      "At least two people were killed and nine more wounded in a shooting Saturday afternoon in a building on the campus of Brown University in Rhode Island, authorities said. The suspect has not been identified and is still at large.",
      "Authorities said that the shooting was reported in the Barus & Holley engineering building a little after 4 p.m. local time. The shooting occurred in a first-floor classroom, Providence Deputy Police Chief Tim O'Hara told reporters. The school said final exams were taking place in the building at the time of the shooting.",
      "Providence Mayor Brett Smiley   said in a news conference that eight of the wounded were taken to Rhode Island Hospital in critical condition. The hospital later said in a statement that six of those patients were in \"critical but stable condition,\" one was in critical condition, and another was in stable condition.",
      "In a follow-up news conference late Saturday night, Smiley said that a ninth victim suffered non-life-threatening injuries when they \"learned that they had received fragments from a shooting that had occurred near them.\" That victim did not sustain a gunshot wound and is expected to make a full recovery, Smiley said.",
      "Brown University President Christina H. Paxson told reporters in the second briefing that all the victims, those killed and wounded, were students.",
      "Smiley said that no arrests had been made, and a shelter-in-place was in place for the Brown University area. No weapons have been recovered, O'Hara said. A university alert told students to lock doors, silence phones and stay hidden until further notice.",
      "O'Hara told reporters the male suspect escaped from the engineering building following the shooting. It was unclear how he had entered the building, officials said, but Smiley noted that the outer doors of Barus & Holley were unlocked because the exams were taking place.",
      "\"In a building like that on a weekend, there are a lot of things going on,\" Brown Provost Francis Doyle said. \"Study sessions, student groups meeting, there are research labs in that building. So we don't have detailed knowledge of exactly what was happening, but we're working with law enforcement.\"",
      "Providence police, late Saturday night, released security video of a person believed to be the suspect leaving Barus & Holley. Smiley said that investigators do not yet know if the gunman was a student.",
      "In\u00a0the video, the suspect was wearing dark gray or black clothing and his face was not visible, O'Hara said during the second news conference. The video does not show a firearm. No weapon has been recovered.",
      "Video of person of interest in Brown shooting: pic.twitter.com/fjufQ3MTdC",
      "\"Some of the witnesses also told us that he may have been wearing a camouflage gray mask,\" O'Hara said, adding that investigators are unsure if there is video showing the suspect inside Barus & Holley.",
      "School public safety had initially reported that a suspect had been taken into custody before retracting that statement.",
      "\"There was an individual who was preliminary thought to be involved, but was later determined to have no involvement,\" Smiley said.",
      "Over 400 local and federal law enforcement officers were in the area assisting in the investigation, Smiley said.",
      "President Trump wrote in a Truth Social post that he had been briefed on the shooting.",
      "\"God bless the victims and the families of the victims!\" Mr. Trump said. The president also initially wrote that a suspect was in custody, but in a follow-up post, wrote, \"The Brown University Police reversed their previous statement \u2014 The suspect is NOT in custody.\"",
      "\"The unthinkable has happened,\" Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee said in the earlier news conference. McKee later told reporters he had spoken by phone to Mr. Trump and FBI Director Kash Patel.",

    "summary": "TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 TikTok has signed a deal to sell its U.S. operations to a consortium of American investors, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Axios was first to report the deal.",
      "Under a law passed last year, TikTok's China-based parent company, ByteDance, must either sever ties with the social media platform's American operations or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. The law set a January 2025 deadline, but President Trump has extended it several times, most recently until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "In September, Mr. Trump signed an executive order paving the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "At the time, a senior White House official said that under the proposed deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, the White House said in September. Mr. Trump's executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by last year's divest-or-ban law.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, are expected to have a stake in the new TikTok, the White House previously said. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "Axios reported Thursday that Oracle, Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based MGX will collectively own 45% of the U.S. entity. Almost one-third of the new entity will be owned by current ByteDance investors, according to Axios.",
      "When reached by CBS News Thursday, an Oracle spokesperson declined to comment on the deal.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said in September, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during a call in September. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "\"China's position on the TikTok issue is clear: The Chinese government respects\u2002the wishes of the company in question, and would be happy to see productive commercial negotiations in keeping with market rules lead to\u2002a solution that complies with China's laws and regulations and takes into account the interests of both sides. The U.S. side needs to\u2002provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory environment for Chinese investors,\" the Chinese government's summary of the September call between Xi and Mr. Trump said.",
      "The sale-or-ban law, which was\u00a0upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration last January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders\u00a0every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "There's been little pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "But some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. After the White House announced the deal in September, Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",

      "A Kremlin envoy will travel to Florida to discuss a U.S.-proposed plan to end the war in Ukraine, a U.S. official said Thursday, as European Union leaders weighed a major loan to help the Ukrainian government.",
      "Kirill Dmitriev, who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund, is set to meet with President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Miami on Saturday, according to an American official who spoke on condition of anonymity to preview a meeting that hasn't yet been publicly announced.",
      "The official said that Witkoff and Kushner will sit down with Dmitriev, after meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week, in which they discussed U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv, territorial concessions and other aspects of the American-authored plan aimed at ending the war.",

      "Witkoff will also meet Friday in Miami with senior officials from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to discuss the next phase of the Gaza deal, a senior State Department official confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The first phase of the Gaza peace plan began on Oct. 10, halting fighting and exchanging hostages for Palestinian prisoners. The next phase involves an international security force and other measures and has not yet started. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said earlier this month he planned to meet with Mr. Trump soon to discuss \"opportunities for peace\" in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end nearly four years of fighting following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine that began on Feb. 24, 2022, but Washington's efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned Wednesday that Moscow would seek to extend its gains in Ukraine if Kyiv and its Western allies reject the Kremlin's demands in peace talks.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions captured by his forces, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which was illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory. He also has demanded that Ukraine withdraw from some areas in eastern Ukraine that Moscow's forces haven't captured yet.",
      "The Kremlin also insists that Ukraine abandon its bid to join NATO and warns that Moscow won't accept the deployment of any troops from NATO members and will view them as a \"legitimate target.\"",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed readiness to drop Ukraine's bid to join the trans-Atlantic alliance if the U.S. and other Western nations give Kyiv security guarantees similar to those offered to NATO members. But Ukraine's preference remains NATO membership as the best security guarantee to prevent further Russian aggression.",
      "At the same time, Zelenskyy has rejected Moscow's demands that it pull back its troops from other areas that Russia hasn't been able to take by force.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian officials were expected to hold negotiations in the U.S. on Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"We have progress in our dialogue with the American side regarding some of our points, they also speak with Russian side,\" Zelenskyy said during a visit to Brussels where EU leaders were set to decide whether to use tens of billions of euros in frozen Russian assets to underwrite a loan to meet Ukraine's military and financial needs over the next two years.",

      "French police on Thursday caught a second inmate who had escaped from prison in late November by sawing through cell bars and using bedsheets, sources close to the case told AFP.",
      "The 19-year-old escapee, suspected in a drug-linked attempted murder case, was found in the southern port city of Marseille after Interpol issued a red notice for him, two sources close to the case told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "He and another detainee had fled an overcrowded jail in the eastern city of Dijon after sawing through their cell bars with blades that investigators suspect were delivered by drone.",
      "Police tracked down the Marseille native some 310 miles south of the prison to a run-down apartment complex in the north of the city, known to be a drug-dealing hotspot.",
      "His fellow fugitive, a 32-year-old man accused of violence against a partner, was arrested a day after their escape, when police officers swooped down on a village bar where he was sipping coffee.",
      "The Dijon public prosecutor's office confirmed Thursday's arrest to AFP, without offering further details.",
      "France has some of the worst prison overcrowding in Europe, ranking third worst after Slovenia and Cyprus, according to a Council of Europe report\u00a0published\u00a0in July. In early October, the national average was 135 inmates per 100 places available. Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "\"Old-fashioned\" blades",
      "Guards noticed the two men had fled from the Dijon prison before dawn.",
      "The 32-year-old man had left a message in his cell, saying he had been held for \"too long,\" according to Dijon's public prosecutor, Olivier Caracotch. It was not immediately clear for how long he had been held.",
      "Union official Ahmed Saih, who represents prison officers at the jail, told AFP shortly after the breakout that the inmates used \"old-fashioned, manual saw blades,\" and that several such blades had been found previously.",
      "The saws were likely delivered by drones, Caracotch said following the escape, with several individuals already sentenced over drone deliveries to the same jail.",
      "In early October, French prisons hosted 135 inmates per 100 places available.",
      "The Dijon prison, built in 1853, is in poor condition, with 311 inmates for 180 places, according to the justice ministry.",
      "In the week before the breakout, Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin announced the Dijon facility was scheduled to receive $7.3 million as part of a program to eradicate mobile phones from six French prisons.",
      "The prison break came less than two weeks after another escape in the northwestern city of Rennes. A 37-year-old convict, who had more than a year left to serve for theft, fled on Nov. 14 during an outing with fellow prisoners to the city's planetarium. He was later caught in the nearby city of Nantes.",

    "published": "Thu, 18 Dec 2025 08:11:21 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration's announcement of plan to sell Taiwan a record $10 billion worth of weapons draws an angry response from China.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 The Trump administration has announced a massive package of arms sales to Taiwan valued at more than $10 billion that includes medium-range missiles, howitzers and drones, drawing an angry response from China.",
      "The State Department announced the sales late Wednesday during a nationally televised address by President Trump, who made scant mention of foreign policy issues and did not speak about China or Taiwan at all.",
      "The tension between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest single economies, has ebbed and flowed during Mr. Trump's second term, largely over trade and tariffs but also over China's increasing aggressiveness toward Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to reunify with the mainland. President Xi Jinping has not ruled out the use of force to make that a reality.",
      "If approved by Congress, it would be the largest-ever U.S. weapons package to Taiwan, exceeding the total amount of $8.4 billion in U.S. arms sales to Taiwan during the Biden administration.",
      "The eight arms sales agreements announced Wednesday cover 82 high-mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS, and 420 Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS \u2014 similar to what the U.S. had been providing Ukraine during the Biden administration to defend itself from Russia \u2014 worth more than $4 billion. They also include 60 self-propelled howitzer systems and related equipment worth more than $4 billion and drones valued at more than $1 billion.",
      "Other sales in the package include military software valued at more than $1 billion, Javelin and TOW missiles worth more than $700 million, helicopter spare parts worth $96 million and refurbishment kits for Harpoon missiles worth $91 million.",
      "The eight sales agreements amount to $11.15 billion, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry.",
      "The State Department said the sales serve \"U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability.\"",
      "\"The proposed sale(s) will help improve the security of the recipient and assist in maintaining political stability, military balance, and economic progress in the region,\" the statements said.",
      "China blasts U.S.-Taiwan arms deals, says they \"will only end up backfiring\"",
      "China's Foreign Ministry attacked the move, saying it would violate diplomatic agreements between China and the U.S.; gravely harm China's sovereignty, security and territorial integrity; and undermine regional stability.",
      "\"The 'Taiwan independence' forces on the island seek independence through force and resist reunification through force, squandering the hard-earned money of the people to purchase weapons at the cost of turning Taiwan into a powder keg,\" said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun.",
      "\"This cannot save the doomed fate of 'Taiwan independence' but will only accelerate the push of the Taiwan Strait toward a dangerous situation of military confrontation and war. The U.S. support for 'Taiwan Independence' through arms will only end up backfiring. Using Taiwan to contain China will not succeed,\" Guo added.",
      "The U.S. role in Taiwan's \"self-defense capabilities\"",
      "Under federal law, the U.S. is obligated to assist Taiwan with its self-defense, a point that has become increasingly contentious with China, which has vowed to take Taiwan by force, if necessary.",
      "President Trump, in an exclusive interview with 60 Minutes aired in early November, said Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't bring up the issue of Taiwan when the two leaders met in late October, but he said Xi knew \"the consequences\" of taking military action against the island.",
      "\"He never brought it up. People were a little surprised at that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But they understand what's gonna happen. He has openly said, and his people have openly said at meetings, 'We would never do anything while President Trump is president,' because they know the consequences.\"",
      "Asked by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell whether he would order U.S. forces to defend Taiwan if Xi did move militarily on the island, Mr. Trump said, \"I can't give away my secrets.\"",
      "Taiwan's Defense Ministry in a statement Thursday expressed gratitude to the U.S. over the arms sale, which it said would help Taiwan maintain \"sufficient self-defense capabilities\" and bring strong deterrent capabilities. Taiwan's bolstering of its defense \"is the foundation for maintaining regional peace and stability,\" the ministry said.",
      "Taiwan's Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung similarly thanked the U.S. for its \"long-term support for regional security and Taiwan's self-defense capabilities,\" which he said are key for deterring a conflict in the Taiwan Strait, the body of water separating Taiwan from China's mainland.",
      "The arms sale comes as Taiwan's government has pledged to raise defense spending to 3.3% of the island's gross domestic product next year and to reach 5% by 2030. The boost came after Mr. Trump and the Pentagon requested that Taiwan spend as much as 10% of its GDP on its defense, a percentage well above what the U.S. or any of its major allies spend on defense. The demand has faced pushback from Taiwan's opposition KMT party and some of its population.",
      "Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te last month announced a special $40 billion budget for arms purchases, including to build an air defense system with high-level detection and interception capabilities called Taiwan Dome. The budget will be allocated over eight years, from 2026 to 2033.",
      "The U.S. boost in military assistance to Taiwan was previewed in legislation adopted by Congress that Mr. Trump is expected to sign Thursday. Last week, the Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act, saying it unfairly targeted China as an aggressor. The U.S. Senate passed the bill Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "A French court on Thursday sentenced a doctor to life in jail for\u00a0poisoning 30 child and adult patients, 12 of whom died, reportedly in an attempt to discredit coworkers.",
      "Frederic Pechier, 53, worked as an anesthetist in two clinics in the eastern city of Besancon, when patients went into cardiac arrest in suspicious circumstances between 2008 and 2017. Twelve could not be resuscitated.",
      "Pechier's youngest victim, 4-year-old Teddy, survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016. The oldest victim was 89.",
      "\"You will be incarcerated immediately,\" presiding judge Delphine Thibierge said.",
      "Pechier, who has denied wrongdoing and had not been detained since the start of the probe, appeared unmoved. Members of his family broke down in tears.",
      "A lawyer from the firm representing him, Ornella Spatafora, said he would appeal.",
      "An investigation was launched in 2017, after suspicious cardiac arrests were recorded during operations on patients considered low-risk.",
      "During the more than three-month trial, prosecutors called for Pechier to be jailed for life, saying he \"used medicine to kill.\"",
      "They say he contaminated IV bags with potassium, local anaesthetics, adrenaline, and even an anticoagulant to trigger cardiac arrest or haemorrhaging in patients being treated by colleagues.",
      "His goal, prosecutors said, was to \"psychologically hurt\" caregivers with whom he was in conflict and to \"feed his thirst for power.\"",
      "Pechier had argued during the probe that the majority of poisonings were the result of \"medical errors\" made by his colleagues.",
      "He admitted during the trial that there had been a person poisoning patients in one of the two clinics where he worked, but said it was not him.",
      "\"I am not a poisoner,\" he said.",
      "\"Whatever the outcome of all this, my career is over,\" Pechier told reporters at a press conference in 2019, BBC News\u00a0reported. \"You cannot trust a doctor who, at one point, has been labeled a poisoner. ... My family is broken and I am afraid for my children.\"",
      "Some colleagues described the doctor as a \"star anesthetist,\" while others said he came across as arrogant and manipulative.",
      "One co-worker claimed Pechier was \"certain he was the best\" and liked to \"think of himself as Zorro.\"",
      "One colleague described Pechier as a very good doctor with an \"oversized ego.\"",
      "Le Monde reported\u00a0that one of Pechier's lawyers withdrew from the case, citing insufficient compensation.",
      "In tears during the trial earlier this month, Pechier recounted trying to kill himself in 2021.",
      "The verdict comes after a court in May sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients, most of them children, between 1989 and 2014.",

    "story": [
      "Authorities investigating the Bondi Beach terrorist attack have been looking into a month-long trip taken by the suspects, father and son Sajid and Naveed Akram, to the Philippines, where there's been a decades-long Islamist insurgency in the south of the country.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said this week that the attack was inspired by ISIS, and there is an ISIS-affiliated militant group operating in a remote area of the Philippines.",
      "But a receptionist at a hotel in Davao City said the attackers never left their room for more than a day.",
      "Jojo, who works at at the GV Hotel in Davao, told CBS News on Thursday that Sajid and Naveed Akram, the elder of whom was killed during the Sunday attack, checked into the hotel on Nov. 1 and then left on Nov. 28.",
      "He said they extended their stay week by week and paid in cash, and that they would go out during the day, but return to the hotel every night, often bringing food back to eat in their room.",
      "He said there was nothing particularly suspicious about the father and son, who had one piece of luggage and one backpack between them.",
      "Australian public broadcaster ABC previously reported that the Bondi Beach attackers had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But on Wednesday, Philippine presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said there was \"no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "The government \"strongly rejects the sweeping statement and the misleading characterization of the Philippines as the ISIS training hotspot,\" Castro said.",
      "There has been an Islamist insurgency in the southern Philippines for many years, but the two main militant groups involved are not affiliated with ISIS, Tom Smith, the academic director of the Royal Air Force College, who studies security and terrorism in the Philippines and Southeast Asia, told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "There is a relatively small splinter group called Abu Sayyaf based on a remote archipelago that is affiliated with ISIS, but Smith said it would be very difficult for foreigners to receive weapons training from the group.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",

    "story": [
      "Ecuadorian police said on Wednesday that Mario Pineida, a 33-year-old Barcelona de Guayaquil defender and former national team player, was shot dead in an apparent attack as violence escalates in the Andean nation.",
      "Another person who police did not identify was also killed in the incident, and a third was wounded.",
      "Ecuador's Interior Ministry confirmed Pineida's death without providing details. Barcelona de Guayaquil said in a statement its fans are saddened by Pineida's death. \"Rest in peace,\" the team wrote in a separate social media post paying tribute to Pineida.",
      "Pineida played eight games for Ecuador but was not involved in the team qualifying for the 2026 World Cup. His last game for Ecuador was at the 2021 Copa Am\u00e9rica, as a late substitute in a group-stage game against Brazil. He also went to the 2017 edition.",
      "Pineida started his professional career at Independiente del Valle, where he played from 2010 to 2015. He then moved to the club of the coastal city of Guayaquil in 2016 and won two league titles there. The defender also had a brief spell at Brazil's Fluminense in 2022.",
      "Ecuadorian media reported the incident took place in the region of Samanes in the north end of Guayaquil, which lies 165 miles southwest of the capital Quito.",
      "Playing soccer in Ecuador can be deadly, with match-fixing mafias part of a global criminal empire that earns gangs some $1.7 trillion per year, according to a recent United Nations estimate.",
      "In November, a 16-year-old footballer of Independiente del Valle died from a stray bullet, also in Guayaquil. Miguel Nazareno was at home \"when he unfortunately became a victim of the insecurity affecting our country,\" the soccer team\u00a0said in an Instagram post, citing a wave of criminal violence began in Ecuador almost five years ago.",

    "story": [
      "Four people were killed in a U.S. military strike Wednesday on an alleged drug-running boat in the Eastern Pacific, the Pentagon said. It marks the latest in a series of strikes dating back to early September that the U.S. has conducted on what it claims are drug-trafficking vessels in the region.",
      "In a social media post, U.S. Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in Central and South America, said Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the \"lethal kinetic strike on a vessel operated by a Designated Terrorist Organizations in international waters.\"",
      "As has been the case with previous such strikes, Southern Command also posted unclassified video showing the boat as it was struck.",
      "\"Intelligence confirmed that the vessel was transiting along a known narco-trafficking route in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations,\" Southern Command said.",
      "The victims were described as \"four male narco-terrorists.\" The U.S. military provided no evidence to support allegations that the boat was ferrying drugs.",
      "The U.S. military has conducted 26 strikes on alleged drug-trafficking vessels in the Eastern Pacific or Caribbean since Sept. 2, killing at least 99 people, according to the Pentagon.",
      "In recent weeks, there has been renewed scrutiny on the strikes after the White House, following a report by The Washington Post, confirmed that in the Sept. 2 attack, the same boat was struck twice, or what has been described as a \"double tap\" or follow-on strike.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that the follow-on strike killed two people who had survived the first strike and were waving overhead. A separate source familiar with the matter told CBS News that the two survivors were attempting to climb back onto the boat.",
      "A total of 11 people were killed by both strikes on Sept. 2, according to the U.S. military.",
      "While video of the Sept. 2 strikes has been shown to some congressional lawmakers in classified briefings, there has been a push for the Pentagon to release the video publicly. However, Hegseth, speaking Tuesday on Capitol Hill,\u00a0said he would not do so.",
      "\"Of course we're not going to release a top-secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,\" Hegseth told reporters.",
      "Some lawmakers and legal experts have contended that the second strike could constitute a war crime.",
      "The vessel strikes have been part of a pressure campaign by the Trump administration on embattled Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom it accuses of being involved in trafficking drugs to the U.S. and collaborating with drug cartels. Venezuela has criticized the boat strikes, and Maduro denies working with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

      "Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, the assistant rabbi at the local Chabad-Lubavitch of Bondi, who had helped to organize what started out as a joyous event on the famous beach, was the first to be mourned on Wednesday.",
      "The funeral took place just a few blocks from where he and other members of Sydney's tight-knit Jewish community were gunned down.",
      "After sharp criticism over what many saw as lax security for the Sunday event, there was a heavy police presence around the synagogue on Wednesday. Officers were seen checking the identification of those heading toward the funeral.",
      "\"He was an angel,\" Rabbi Moshe Gutnick told CBS News as Schlanger's body was transported. \"He was goodness personified. Everything that he did was about doing good for people.\"",
      "\"He was the heart and soul of the synagogue,\" he added. \"We are all going to miss him terribly.\"",
      "Gutnick's brother-in-law, 62-year-old Reuven Morrison, was also among those killed on Sunday, as he hurled stones at one of the attackers, Morrison's daughter told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "Given how close the community is, Rabbi Gutnick said he would be attending funerals in the coming days, \"not once, not twice but many more times.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The latest Democratic-led attempt to limit President Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-smuggling boats in the region failed Wednesday, as tensions with the South American country continue to escalate.",
      "House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump has warned that land strikes against the country could commence \"soon.\" Mr. Trump's threats come amid a months-long military campaign against alleged drug smuggling boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that have killed at least 95 people.",
      "Both measures fell short.",
      "The first measure, introduced by Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, would remove U.S. armed forces \"from hostilities with any presidentially designated terrorist organization in the Western Hemisphere,\" unless Congress has declared war or authorized the use of military force for such purposes. It failed in a 210 to 216 vote.",
      "A second measure from Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts would remove the armed forces \"from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\" Some 211 voted in favor and 213 voted against it.",
      "Meeks' resolution had the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Don Bacon of Nebraska, while Democratic Reps. Henry Cuellar of Texas and Vicente Gonzalez of Texas voted against it.",
      "Three Republicans \u2014 Massie, Bacon and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia \u2014 supported McGovern's resolution. Cuellar was the lone Democrat to vote against.",
      "Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the president is required to consult Congress \"in every possible instance\" before introducing armed forces into hostilities, unless there has been a declaration of war or other congressional authorization. But the White House has suggested that the decades-old law does not apply to the boat strikes because it does not view the attacks as putting service members in harm's way.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth held two separate classified briefings Tuesday for all senators and House members. The House and Senate Armed Services Committee received a more detailed briefing on Wednesday with Navy Adm. Frank Bradley, who ordered a second strike killing survivors of the initial Sept. 2 boat attack.",
      "Meeks left Tuesday's House briefing saying members received no adequate explanation for why the Trump administration has not consulted Congress before the strikes. He also questioned the president's motivations.",
      "\"It doesn't seem to be just about narcotics trafficking,\" Meeks told reporters Tuesday. \"So if this is about regime change, it seems to me that the administration should say that's what it is, and should come to Congress to ask for that authorization, which has not taken place.\"",
      "Bacon said after Wednesday's briefing that he would vote to authorize military action against Venezuela, but he still believes that Mr. Trump needs to get approval from Congress.",
      "\"I think there's enough support in Congress to pass an authorization,\" Bacon added. \"The mission is right, but continued hostilities does require congressional approval.\"",
      "A day before the votes, Vanity Fair published a piece based on nearly a dozen interviews with Mr. Trump's chief of staff Susie Wiles, in which she said the president \"wants to keep on blowing boats up until [Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s] Maduro cries uncle. And people way smarter than me on that say that he will.\"",
      "The statement appeared to be in contradiction with the administration's stance that it is conducting the strikes to stop the flow of drugs to the U.S., not ousting Maduro.",
      "Wiles conceded that strikes on land would require congressional approval.",
      "\"If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then [we'd need] Congress,\" she told Vanity Fair.",
      "Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said he's \"very concerned\" about the U.S. actions around Venezuela.",
      "\"At this point, we still don't have a clear idea of what the president is trying to accomplish,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"But it sure looks like he's trying to accomplish regime change in Venezuela, and that he's willing to go to war and accomplish that, all without any congressional authorization.\"",
      "In a further escalation of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign against Maduro, the president on Tuesday said he was declaring the Venezuelan government a \"foreign terrorist organization\" and called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday that the president has the authority to order the boat strikes under his constitutional authority.",
      "\"It is certainly appropriate,\" the Louisiana Republican told reporters. \"It's necessary to protect the United States and our interests.\"",
      "During floor debate Wednesday, GOP Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, argued the president does not need congressional authorization to carry out \"precise, limited strikes.\"",
      "\"This president wants to be the judge, jury and the executioner,\" said Meeks, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's top Democrat.",
      "The House votes follow two failed efforts in the Senate to prohibit Mr. Trump from continuing military action against drug cartels without approval from Congress. A third Senate vote could happen as soon as this week.",

    "story": [
      "A Second Amendment clash has erupted between the federal government and the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "The U.S. government sued the U.S. territory, its police department and Police Commissioner Mario Brooks on Tuesday, accusing them of obstructing and systematically denying American citizens the right to possess and carry guns.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands requires that applicants demonstrate \"good reason to fear death or great injury to his person or property,\" and to have \"two credible persons\" to vouch for their need of a firearm. Local law also requires that someone have \"good moral character\" to obtain a gun permit, which is valid for up to three years and applies to a single weapon.",
      "The lawsuit states that no specific standard has been set or defined for the requirement of character. It also claims that the defendants \"regularly\" refuse to issue permits to those who by law are \"deemed to be an improper person\" by the territory's police commissioner.",
      "The lawsuit states that those in the U.S. territory also must \"submit to intrusive and warrantless home searches\" as one condition to obtain a gun permit. If an applicant refuses a home inspection, which takes \"several months to a year to schedule and complete,\" the government will not process their request, according to the lawsuit.",
      "It also notes that the police department \"denies firearms licenses to otherwise qualified applicants whenever it deems that the applicant has 'too many' firearms.\"",
      "In addition, the lawsuit accuses the U.S. Virgin Islands of demanding that applicants \"unnecessarily spend money to install a safe,\" and that it be bolted to the floor or wall of their home.",
      "The lawsuit accuses the defendants of defying \"binding Supreme Court precedent to frustrate the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.\"",
      "It notes that those citizens \"have a fundamental right to possess guns in their homes\" and carry handguns publicly for the purpose of immediate self-defense.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands. It asks that a judge find that the defendants are violating the Second Amendment and seeks an injunction to prohibit them from implementing local laws tied to the issuance of firearms licenses.",
      "The U.S. Virgin Islands government said in a statement late Tuesday that it is reviewing the lawsuit and taking the allegations seriously.",
      "It noted that the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. and Lt. Gov. Tregenza A. Roach \"is committed to protecting constitutional rights while maintaining public safety.\"",
      "The statement said that the allegations would be addressed in court, and that no further comment would be issued.",
      "The lawsuit was filed as the administration of President Trump pushes to expand gun rights. Last year, Trump claimed that the Second Amendment was \"under siege\" and described himself as \"the best friend gun owners have ever had in the White House.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/uk-police-antisemitism-protests-more-assertive-bondi-beach-attack/",
    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 12:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "After Bondi Beach attack, Britain's two biggest police forces indicate they will arrest people who use \"phrases causing fear in Jewish communities.\"",
    "story": [
      "Britain's two biggest police forces announced Wednesday that officers would take an \"enhanced approach\" to counter antisemitism, arresting protesters who use certain slogans and phrases, in response to a surge in\u00a0hate crimes targeting Jewish people in the United Kingdom.",
      "The\u00a0announcement was a response, the London Metropolitan and Greater Manchester Police forces said, to Sunday's\u00a0terrorist attack in Bondi Beach, Australia, targeting a Hanukkah event, in which 15 people were fatally shot. Police also cited a spate of incidents on British soil, including a vehicle and knife assault outside a synagogue in Manchester in October that left two Jewish people dead.",
      "\"Antisemitic hate crime has surged, protests have intensified, and online abuse has grown since 2023,\" the police forces said. \"The increased fear in Jewish communities, and high number of terrorist attacks disrupted in recent years requires an enhanced response.\"",
      "\"The words and chants used, especially in protests, matter and have real world consequences,\" the statement said. \"Now, in the escalating threat context, we will recalibrate to be more assertive.\"",
      "The forces said that officers \"have consistently been advised\" by British prosecutors that \"many of the phrases causing fear in Jewish communities don't meet prosecution thresholds\" under the U.K.'s current hate speech laws, so the new approach would work largely under the existing Public Order Act.",
      "\"We know communities are concerned about placards and chants such as 'globalize the intifada' and those using it at future protest or in a targeted way should expect the Met and GMP to take action,\" the police said. \"Violent acts have taken place, the context has changed \u2014 words have meaning and consequence. We will act decisively and make arrests.\"",
      "\"The current laws are inadequate,\" said the statement attributed to Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley and Manchester Chief Constable Sir Stephen Watson, adding that the forces welcomed a planned review by the government of existing public order and hate crime laws.",
      "\"Jewish communities across London, Greater Manchester, and the rest of the United Kingdom are already worried and scared,\" the police statement said, and that the attacks in Australia and Manchester \"only adds to it.\"",
      "The police said officers would be briefed on this new approach, calling the measures \"practical and immediate,\" but offering little detail on what, beyond the specific phrase about a global \"intifada,\" might now be deemed illegal behavior.",
      "It said there had already been stepped-up police patrols around synagogues, Jewish schools and community venues.",
      "\"Our intent is clear: create a hostile environment for offenders and a safer environment for Jewish communities, while protecting lawful protest,\" the police said. \"It is possible to protest in support of Palestinian people without intimidating Jewish communities or breaking the law.\"",
      "One of the leaders of pro-Palestinian protests in the U.K., Palestinian Solidarity Campaign director Ben Jamal, criticized the announcement by the British police, calling it \"another low in the political repression of protest for Palestinian rights,\" according to CBS News' partner network BBC News.",
      "He said there was no consultation with his organization \"before making this far-reaching statement on our rights.\"",
      "\"The horrific massacre in Sydney, Australia should not be used as a justification to further repress fundamental democratic rights of protest and free speech in this country,\" Jamal said.",
      "The Board of Deputies of British Jews advocacy group said in a social media post that its members \"strongly welcome this necessary intervention\" by the police forces, which it said came \"after repeated urging from the Board of Deputies and others.\"",
      "Australia takes a different approach",
      "Authorities in Australia are still in the early days of their investigation into the Bondi Beach attack, but they have faced sharp criticism from the Jewish community in Sydney and abroad over a perceived lack of preparedness given a documented rise in antisemitism.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said it was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" and he and was quick to label it \"an act of evil antisemitism, terrorism.\"",
      "Albanese said just hours after the attack that his government was \"prepared to take whatever action is necessary. Included in that is the need for tougher gun laws.\"",
      "Police have said the suspects \u2014 a father and son \u2014   used rifles and shotguns owned legally by the older man. Albanese proposed new laws to limit the number of guns a licensed owner can obtain, and a review into how existing licenses could be subject to renewal over time.",
      "Chris Minns, the Premier of New South Wales state, where Bondi Beach is located, said Monday that the attack \"demands an overwhelming response,\" announcing that more than 320 police officers would be \"deployed today, and we will continue to increase that number.\"",
      "He said Tuesday that the state was looking at reforms that could include denying permission for protests after terror events.",
      "\"My concern is that a mass demonstration in this combustible situation with our multicultural community could light a flame that would be impossible to extinguish,\" Minns told reporters, according to The Guardian newspaper. \"In many cases, particularly in relation to restrictions on protests, there are constitutional issues. So, it has to be drafted in a particular way. We have to be very clear about the designation and the reason for it. I'm being crystal clear about it. I'm worried about a combustible situation and community harmony. That's the reason we would introduce this legislation. It's begun, the drafting process has begun. But when it's completed I'll let you know.\"",
      "The state premier added, however, that there had been \"a lot of conflation that protests lead to violence because some chants are being said, yet the events on Sunday were not related to a protest at all.\"",
      "Minns said any new law brought in would target no specific group, but rather \"be a blanket rule in place\" only in the wake of a terrorist incident.",
      "Albanese, speaking in a radio interview on Wednesday, highlighted some of the measures his government has already taken to address antisemitism, including appointing the nation's first ever envoy dedicated to the topic.",
      "\"We've strengthened legislation to address antisemitism and hateful conduct \u2014 criminalized hate speech advocating violence,\" Albanese said, noting also \"a landmark ban on the Nazi salute and hate symbols\" adopted last year.",
      "\"We've enhanced protection of Jewish communities,\" the prime minister said, adding in conclusion: \"There's more to do.\"",

    "summary": "Ahmed al Ahmed, the Syrian-Australian father who wrestled a shotgun from one of the gunmen attacking a Jewish gathering, is facing a long road to recovery.",
    "story": [
      "Like many Australians strolling at Bondi Beach on long, warm summer evenings, Ahmed al Ahmed just wanted a cup of coffee with a friend. Around him, a bloody massacre erupted as two gunmen targeted Jews during Hanukkah festivities at a park close to the shore.",
      "Soon al Ahmed was creeping, bent over, between two parked cars, before barreling directly toward one of the unsuspecting shooters. In video that has been viewed millions of times around the world, the 44-year-old father can be seen tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the man's shotgun from his grip and turning it on the attacker.",
      "The story of the Syrian-Australian Muslim shop owner who put an end to the rampage of one of the shooters on Sunday has been seized upon by a country desperately seeking comfort after one of its darkest hours: the slaying of 15 people as they celebrated their Jewish faith.",
      "\"At a moment where we have seen evil perpetrated, he shines out as an example of the strength of humanity,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday, as he left a Sydney hospital where al Ahmed is being treated for gunshot wounds. \"We are a brave country. Ahmed al Ahmed represents the best of our country.\"",
      "A fundraising page established by Australians who had never met al Ahmed had attracted by Tuesday night donations by some 40,000 people, who gave 2.3 million Australian dollars ($1.5 million). Among the supporters was the billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, who pledged AU$99,000.",
      "Al Ahmed, who is married with two young daughters, faces a long struggle ahead, those who have spoken to him since Sunday's massacre say. He was shot multiple times in the left arm, apparently by the second gunman in the attack as the man fired indiscriminately from a footbridge.",
      "He has already undergone surgery and more operations are scheduled, said Lubaba alhmidi Alkahil, a spokesperson for the Australians for Syria Association, who visited al Ahmed in a hospital late Monday. The \"quiet and humble\" man was conscious but frail and faced at least six months of recovery, Alkahil said.",
      "Under Australia's national, tax-funded health care system, Al Ahmed, who is a permanent legal resident of the country, is unlikely to face any bills for his care.",
      "In the days since the attack, a pile of floral tributes and notes of thanks has grown outside the small convenience store al Ahmed owns opposite a train station in suburban Sydney. Meanwhile, he has received visits at the hospital from Australia's leaders, apparently telling Chris Minns, the premier of New South Wales state, that he'd take the same action again.",
      "He has been hailed as a hero by world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump and Australia's Governor General, who is the representative of Britain's King Charles in the country. Minns said al Ahmed saved \"countless\" lives in what the premier said was \"the most unbelievable scene I've ever seen.\"",
      "Al Ahmed lived in the town of Nayrab in Syria's Idlib region before he arrived in Australia, his cousin Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. He left Syria in 2006 after finishing his studies, before the 2011 mass protests against the government of then-President Bashar Assad that were met with a brutal crackdown and spiraled into a nearly 14-year civil war.",
      "Nayrab was heavily bombed by Assad's forces with most of the town's houses flattened and reduced to rubble. On Tuesday, al Ahmed was the talk of the town.",
      "\"Ahmed did really a heroic job,\" his cousin, Mohammad al Ahmed told The Associated Press. \"Without any hesitation, he tackled the terrorist and disarmed him just to save innocent people.\"",
      "Ahmed al Ahmed's parents, who came to Sydney this year to reunite with their son, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. that their son had served with the police and in the central security forces in Syria. Father Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said his son's \"conscience and soul\" compelled him to act on Sunday.",
      "\"I feel pride and honor because my son is a hero of Australia,\" the father said.",
      "In the aftermath of the mass killing, a country roiling from one of the worst hate-fueled attacks ever on its soil - allegedly committed by an Australian resident who arrived from India in 1998 and his Australian-born son - looked for hope amid their grief.",
      "Other stories of heroism have also emerged.",
      "They included the tale of a married couple, Boris and Sofia Gurman, who were both killed while trying to stop one of the shooters as he climbed from his car and began the massacre, their family has told Australian news outlets.",
      "\"Bondi locals, together they lived honest, hardworking lives and treated everyone they met with kindness, warmth and respect,\" the family said in a statement. \"Boris and Sofia were devoted to their family and to each other. They were the heart of our family, and their absence has left an immeasurable void.\"",
      "Reuven Morrison, 62, was also killed while trying to stop the horror, according to his daughter, Sheina Gutnick. After al Ahmed wrestled the gun from one shooter, Morrison can be seen throwing objects at the gunman - before he was shot by the second man.",
      "\"My dear father, Reuven Morrison was shot dead for being Jewish at a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach while protecting lives, while jumping up, putting his own life at risk to save his fellow Jewish community members,\" Gutnick told CBS News earlier this week.",
      "Acts of courage like these were cited by many on social media and in news outlets as examples of what being Australian should mean.",
      "\"When he did what he did, he wasn't thinking at all about the background of the people he's saving, the people dying in the street,\" Mohamed Fateh al Ahmed said of his son. \"He doesn't discriminate between one nationality and another, especially here in Australia there's no difference between one citizen and another.\"",

    "summary": "Temperatures in the Arctic continue to follow a long-term warming trend, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
    "story": [
      "The Arctic just experienced its hottest year since record-keeping began more than a century ago, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Wednesday. Rising temperatures in the polar region show no signs of leveling off, either, according to the agency, which said they are rising twice as fast as overall global temperatures.",
      "NOAA reviewed how the Arctic is faring in a warming world in the latest iteration of its annual Arctic Report Card.",
      "\"To observe the Arctic is to take the pulse of the planet,\" reads the report's executive summary. \"The Arctic is warming several times faster than Earth as a whole, reshaping the northern landscapes, ecosystems, and livelihoods of Arctic peoples. Also transforming are the roles the Arctic plays in the global climate, economic, and societal systems.\"",
      "Since the previous year's report card, climate change has continued to impact the Earth's northernmost area even more than the rest of the planet, NOAA said. The latest report details some of the most concerning developments observed over the last year, with scientists noting \"a clear pattern of Arctic warming.\"",
      "During the observational period, from October 2024 to September 2025, average sea surface temperatures measured in the Arctic were higher than the 1991-2020 average by as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the report. Those were the warmest sea surface temperatures observed in the Arctic since at least 1900, signaling an intensifying climate pattern for the region.",
      "In March, Arctic winter sea ice hit its lowest annual maximum extent in the 47 years of satellite data collection, and six months later, the ice reached its 10th lowest annual minimum. \"All of the 19 lowest September minimum ice extents have occurred in the last 19 years,\" the report noted.",
      "Air temperatures increased, too. The autumn season of 2024 was the warmest on record, and the winter of 2025 ranked as the second-warmest, the report card said. Scientists also determined that Arctic temperatures since 2006 have increased at more than double the rate of global temperature changes. They have been warning for years that climate change is heating up the northern polar region more dramatically than anywhere else.",
      "Vital ecosystems are being transformed as a result of the Arctic's persistent warmth, according to the report card. The heat is accelerating sea ice loss and glacier melt while transforming the region's landscapes. Its tundra, for example, has been turning green as thawed permafrost and longer summers give foliage more opportunities to grow.",
      "Scientists emphasize that what happens to the Arctic directly affects the rest of the world, especially as sea ice minimums have continued to drop. Glaciers in Scandinavia saw their largest annual loss of ice on record between 2023 and 2024, and the Greenland Ice Sheet lost an estimated 129 billion tons of ice in 2025, according to NOAA, continuing an ongoing trend.",
      "\"Ongoing glacier loss contributes to steadily rising global sea levels, threatening Arctic communities' water supplies, driving destructive floods and increasing landslide and tsunami hazards that endanger people, infrastructure, and coastline,\" NOAA's report said.",

      "He said two longstanding militant groups \u2014 the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, known as the MILF, and the Moro National Liberation Front, or MNLF \u2014 have been \"sort of the grandfather, old rebellious groups of the Islamist movement\" in the Philippines.",
      "But, Smith said, \"when you have two rather, sort of beefy militant groups, people get disgruntled. And so there's loads of other fringe, much smaller militant groups\" in the region, including one called Abu Sayyaf, which is affiliated with ISIS.",
      "Smith said these groups are \"much smaller in number, but probably more vicious in their attacks against civilians and government officials.\"",
      "\"Analysts now describe Abu Sayyaf as fragmented remnants with residual ideological affinity to Islamic State (ISIS), but little evidence of real operational direction or sustained funding\" from ISIS, Lucas Webber, a senior research fellow at the New York-based Soufan Center think tank, told CBS News.",
      "Based in the Philippines' remote Sulu archipelago, Abu Sayyaf's main business is kidnapping for ransom, Smith said.",
      "They \"wrapped themselves in the ISIS flag, or the al Qaeda banner in years gone by, because they want to inflate their sense of danger. Because, quite frankly, there's an economic incentive to that. Because it means that they will get a higher ransom paid more efficiently, and these guys don't play,\" he said. \"They will actually behead people.\"",
      "That is a view shared by the U.S. government, which designated Abu Sayyaf as a terrorist organization in 1997, not long after it emerged as an offshoot of the larger Islamist groups in the country.",
      "According to the U.S. State Department's most recent assessment from 2023, it is \"one of the most violent terrorist groups in the Philippines.\"",
      "\"Some Abu Sayyaf Group factions have been reported to interact and coordinate with ISIS-P [ISIS-Philippines], including by participating in attacks that are claimed by ISIS in the Sulu Archipelago,\" the U.S. government assessment said, adding that it had \"committed bombings, ambushes of security personnel, public beheadings, assassinations, extortion, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "But both Smith and Webber told CBS News that Abu Sayyaf, and other regional factions, had been dealt a serious blow in recent years.",
      "\"Years of military pressure [with U.S. support], better local governance in Bangsamoro, and amnesty/reintegration programs have broken up many networks, led to mass surrenders, and sharply reduced the frequency and scale of attacks,\" Webber said. \"At the same time, small pockets of militants and ex\u2011fighters with IS ideology remain in parts of Mindanao and the Sulu archipelago, and individuals can still be radicalized online or through personal ties. The main risk today is less a large 'IS province' on Philippine soil, and more the possibility that residual cells or sympathizers could attempt sporadic attacks or link up with transnational plots if local conditions deteriorate or security efforts are neglected.\"",
      "Terror training camps?",
      "The Associated Press cited Philippine military and police officials on Tuesday as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Smith said to travel to receive weapons training with Abu Sayyaf militants would be very difficult for foreigners in the Philippines, especially without any local language skills.",
      "\"They would stick out like a sore thumb,\" Smith said. \"When I go there, you know, I'm there with military support. I have a Ph.D. in the area, and even I stick out like a sore thumb.\"",
      "He said there are \"plenty of armed people in Mindanao, in the Philippines, for them to go and practice, you know, firing rifles and what have you. But it's a long way to say that that equals a terrorist camp.\"",
      "Referring to the suspects in the Bondi Beach attack, Smith said it was \"much more likely that they could have got some ex-rebels and gone somewhere in the jungle for a couple of weeks and been shown how to fire and clean their rifles and stuff like that.\"",
      "The two larger militant groups, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the Moro National Liberation Front   \u2014 which are not affiliated with ISIS \u2014 do \"have the training camps. They're left alone to their territories. But it would be very unusual if the Bondi Beach attackers got orientated with them, because I just can't imagine that the MILF or the MNLF would have countenanced that. So it is really unusual,\" Smith said.",

    "published": "Wed, 17 Dec 2025 02:44:08 -0500",
    "summary": "The men suspected of attacking a Jewish gathering on Bondi Beach were inspired by the ISIS terror group and spent weeks last month in the Philippines, officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Tuesday that the father and son suspects in the antisemitic terror attack on a Hanukkah gathering on Bondi Beach were inspired by ISIS, as officials in India confirmed that the older man was originally from that nation.",
      "Authorities also revealed that gunmen had recently returned from the Philippines, where they traveled to an area known as a hotbed for terrorist groups.",
      "The mass shooting on the famous beach left 15 innocent people dead, including a 10-year-old girl and an Holocaust survivor. The attack was \"motivated by Islamic State ideology,\" Albanese said Tuesday as he visited one of the heroes who tried to stop the attackers.",
      "Australia's federal police commissioner Krissy Barrett also said Tuesday that it was \"a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State,\" referring to the now disparate group that, for several years, held a huge swathe of territory spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "The suspects, a father and son aged 50 and 24, used guns that were owned legally by the older man, whom officials in New South Wales state have named as Sajid Akram. He was shot dead at the scene, and his son was still being treated in a hospital on Tuesday, where he had regained consciousness.",
      "Police said Wednesday that the younger man was charged with 59 offenses including 15 counts of murder and one of terrorism.",
      "Indian police confirm father was from Hyderabad",
      "Police in the southern Indian state of Telangana confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that Sajid Akram was originally from the city of Hyderabad. In a statement, the police said he earned a degree in Hyderabad before migrating to Australia in November 1998, where he married a woman of European origin.",
      "Sajid Akram held an Indian passport, while his son Naveed and a daughter were both born in Australia and are citizens of the country, the police said, confirming previous statements by Australian officials about the son's nationality. U.S. officials had told CBS News soon after the attack that at least one of the Akrams was believed to be a Pakistani national, but that appears to have been a case of mistaken identity, and a man with the same name as the younger suspect has come forward in Sydney to say he was wrongly identified.",
      "The Telangana police said the elder Akram had \"limited contact with his family in Hyderabad over the past 27 years,\" visiting six times since he migrated to Australia, \"primarily for family-related reasons.\"",
      "The police statement said family members in India had \"expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalization, and that the son's apparent radicalization appeared \"to have no connection with India.\"",
      "Australian officials have confirmed that homemade ISIS flags were found \u2014   along with an improvised explosive device \u2014   in the suspects' vehicle at Bondi Beach on Sunday, and police provided new information on Tuesday about their recent movements.",
      "Suspected gunmen spent most of November in the Philippines",
      "Both men traveled to the Philippines in November, New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon told reporters on Tuesday, adding that investigators were still looking into the reasons for the trip and where exactly the men went.",
      "The Philippines Bureau of Immigration said both Sajid Akram and his son, identified widely by Australian media as Naveed Akram, spent most of November \u2014 from the 1st until the 28th \u2014   in the Philippines, and listing the city of Davao as their final destination.",
      "Muslim separatists, including the Islamist Abu Sayyaf group that once publicly backed ISIS, are active in that part of the southern Philippines. ABC, the Australian public broadcaster, said the men had undergone \"military-style training\" in the Philippines, citing security sources.",
      "But Philippines presidential spokesperson Claire Castro, quoting a National Security Council statement, said \"there is no validated report or confirmation that individuals involved in the Bondi Beach incident received any form of training in the Philippines,\" according to French news agency AFP.",
      "That group and others in the region have drawn and trained some foreign militants from across Asia, the Middle East and Europe in the past, according to the Associated Press, though Abu Sayyaf has been weakened in recent years by repeated military offensives.",
      "The AP cited Philippine military and police officials as saying there has been no recent indication of any foreign militants operating in the south of the country.",
      "Did Australian officials fail the Jewish community?",
      "Australian officials confirmed Monday that Naveed Akram was under investigation for about six months during 2019 for suspected links to a Sydney-based terror cell, though the nation's primary spy agency found he represented no threat, and officials said the probe had focused on associates.",
      "Australia's ABC network\u00a0reported that his ties included \"longstanding links\" to members of a pro-ISIS cell in Australia, including contact with alleged jihadist spiritual leader Wisam Haddad and a man named Youssef Uweinat, who was convicted of recruiting young people in Australia to Islamic extremism.",
      "A lawyer for Haddad has denied that the cleric had \"any knowledge of or involvement in the shootings that took place at Bondi Beach,\" according to the network.",
      "Many people, from the daughter of one of the victims, to a former Australian leader, have told CBS News the men's history should have raised serious red flags, if not stopped them before they claimed so many lives.",
      "Israeli officials have harshly criticized Australia's government for failing to protect Jewish people amid a sharp rise in recent years of antisemitic incidents.",
      "\"We are now facing here a surge of antisemitism, and Australians of Jewish faith are not feeling secure in their own country, and this is insane,\" Israeli Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon told CBS News on Tuesday, urging Australian leaders to create opportunities for young people of different faiths to come together, \"and not once a year, but on a weekly basis.\"",
      "Maimon also said \"boundaries should be set\" by Australian authorities, referring to pro-Palestinian demonstrations that have been held in the country.",
      "\"I believe that it's very important to make sure that while the principle of freedom of expression should be kept, there should be also a limit to the language that some protesters, and in some protests, we hear,\" he said. \"I always believe that there is room to do more. Always. I'm asking myself every day, 'what can I do better? How can I do better?' And I'm trying to do it. And I do expect the Australian government to do better.\"",
      "Former Australian leader says there are no easy answers",
      "Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told CBS News on Tuesday that the national government undoubtedly had some very big questions to answer, but he stressed that intelligence gathering \u2014 for all nations \u2014 is an imperfect science.",
      "\"This type of terrorism has been, the elements of that, have been present in Australia for a long time, and our agencies spend a lot of time keeping an eye on them, but it's hard to track every single person,\" said Turnbull, who was Australian prime minister from 2015 to 2018.",
      "\"Certainly, it's a very big question: Why does somebody living in the suburbs of Sydney need six long arms, as he [Sajid Akram] had, even though they were licensed? Second question is, why were they licensed to a man who had a son who had been on an ASIO [Australian Security Intelligence Organization] watchlist because of links to ISIS-related entities? \u00a0\u2026 And that trip to the Philippines raises another question: Why were they there? And so, you know, this gets back to the problem that I think we face all around the world, is databases talking to each other? Are we actually putting all the dots together in time?\"",
      "\"There are holes in everybody's intelligence gathering,\" Turnbull said. \"But as you know, the terrorist only has to be right once. The security agencies have to be right every time.\"",
      "Regarding the sharp criticism levelled by many in the Jewish community, in particular, over perceived failings in detecting the threat posed by the suspects, and also in sufficiently protecting the pre-planned Jewish event on Bondi Beach, Turnbull said he wasn't sure how much more could have been done by his successor Albanese.",
      "\"I've been prime minister, right? And I'm on the opposite side of politics, so I'm not trying to be partisan about this, but I struggle to see what he could have done that was different. I mean there have been people saying he shouldn't have allowed pro-Palestine marches. Well, you know, we do have freedom of assembly and freedom of speech in Australia. I mean we have restrictions in Australia on speech, on hate speech, and on guns, in particular.\"",
      "\"When I ask people, they will say he should have condemned antisemitism more often. Well, I've never heard him do anything other than condemn it, but my question really is to say, what would difference would that have made? To those terrorists, you know, they're not going to listen to a lecture on the evils of antisemitism from you or me or Anthony Albanese.\"",
      "\"Remember, terrorism is a political act, right? So, you've got to try to interrupt people being radicalized, particularly young men, it's the most vulnerable group, and that involves monitoring what is being said online, what they're being taught, you know, in schools or in mosques or in other places. And the intelligence agencies are doing that all the time,\" he said.",

      "President Trump on Tuesday called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or depart Venezuela, as the administration heaps pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro at sea and leaves the door open for possible land strikes.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment. The Pentagon referred CBS News to the White House.",
      "Last week, the U.S. military seized a sanctioned 20-year-old oil tanker that had just left port in Venezuela, sources told CBS News. Armed personnel approached in helicopters and boarded the vessel, which was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury three years ago for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian military and its proxies in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump's Tuesday night announcement suggests that further seizures are possible. It's not clear how many vessels are covered by the planned blockade.",
      "The Maduro government called last week's boat seizure \"robbery\" and \"piracy.\" In a statement late Tuesday, Venezuela called the blockade a \"grotesque threat\" and a violation of international law, and accused the Trump administration of seeking to \"appropriate the oil, land and minerals of the country through gigantic campaigns of lies and manipulations.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett believes any future boat seizures are unlikely to lead to increases in global oil prices, he told CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\"\u00a0over the weekend. He didn't specify whether a total blockade was on the table, but said the administration is trying to crack down on a \"black market for oil.\"",
      "Venezuela is a major oil producer with some of the world's largest petroleum reserves. But its oil industry has been heavily sanctioned by the U.S. for years, with the Biden and Trump administrations citing human rights concerns and widespread allegations of fraud in Venezuela's last two elections.",
      "Heavily sanctioned oil producers like Venezuela, Russia and Iran have sought to export their oil despite the U.S. restrictions, in some cases allegedly turning to a global \"shadow fleet\" of older oil tankers with questionable registrations \u2014 a move that has\u00a0vexed\u00a0federal authorities.",
      "Since Mr. Trump returned to office in January, he has ramped up economic pressure on Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of colluding with drug cartels. The Venezuelan government has denied those allegations.",
      "Last week, the administration sanctioned six ships accused of carrying oil from Venezuela, along with three nephews of Maduro, two of whom were accused of narcotics trafficking and one of whom worked for the country's state oil company.",

    "summary": "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
    "story": [
      "Hundreds of yards of dinosaur tracks with toes and claws have been found in the Italian Alps in a region that will host the 2026 Winter Olympics, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "\"This set of dinosaur footprints is one of the largest collections in all of Europe, in the whole world,\" Attilio Fontana, head of the Lombardy region in northern Italy, said during a news conference.",
      "The tracks, which are over 200 million years old, were discovered in the Stelvio National Park, in an area between the towns of Bormio and Livigno, which host part of the Games.",
      "Nature photographer Elio Della Ferrera first spotted the imprints in September in an almost vertical rocky slope.",
      "Some measured up to 16 inches in diameter.",
      "The collection \"extends for hundreds of meters and also represents a series of animal behaviors, because in addition to seeing animals walking together, there are also places where these animals meet,\" Fontana said.",
      "Della Ferrera called in paleontologist Cristiano Dal Sasso from Milan's Natural History Museum, who assembled a team of Italian experts to study the site.",
      "The museum released multiple images of the footprints uncovered in the so-called valley of dinosaurs\u00a0on social media.",
      "\"It's an immense scientific heritage,\" Dal Sasso said in the region's press release.",
      "\"The parallel walks are clear evidence of herds moving in synchrony, and there are also traces of more complex behaviors, such as groups of animals gathered in a circle, perhaps for defense.\"",
      "\"Impressions of the toes and even the claws\"",
      "The tracks, currently covered by snow and off the beaten track, are preserved in Upper Triassic dolomitic rocks, dating back approximately 210 million years.",
      "Most of the footprints are elongated and made by bipeds. The best-preserved ones bear traces of at least four toes.",
      "That suggests they belong to prosauropods, herbivorous dinosaurs with long necks and small heads, which are considered the ancestors of the large sauropods of the Jurassic period like the Brontosaurus, the experts said.",
      "Prosauropods had sharp claws, and adults could reach up to 33 feet in length.",
      "There may also be tracks of predatory dinosaurs and archosaurs, the ancestors of crocodiles, the press release said.",
      "The prints are on an almost-vertical slope due to the formation of the Alpine chain.",
      "But when the dinosaurs walked through the area, it was formed of tidal flats that stretched for hundreds of miles, and the environment was tropical.",
      "\"The tracks were made when the sediments were still soft and saturated with water, on the broad tidal flats surrounding the Tethys Ocean,\" ichnologist Fabio Massimo Petti said, referring to a prehistoric ocean.",
      "\"The plasticity of those very fine calcareous muds, now transformed into rock, has in areas preserved truly remarkable anatomical details, such as impressions of the toes and even the claws,\" he said.",
      "The footprints were then covered by sediments which protected them, but with the uplift of the Alps and the erosion of the mountainside, they have been brought back into view.",
      "\"As the layers containing the tracks are diverse and overlapping, we have a unique opportunity to study the evolution of animals and their environment over time,\" geologist Fabrizio Berra said. \"Like reading the pages of a stone book.\"",
      "Other recent dinosaur track discoveries",
      "Researchers have unearthed other dinosaur footprints recently.",
      "Earlier this month, paleontologists in Bolivia said they found and meticulously documented 16,600 footprints left by theropods, the dinosaur group that includes the Tyrannosaurus rex.",
      "In March,\u00a0scientists in England\u00a0discovered a 650-foot trail of dinosaur footprints made 160 million years ago by massive sauropod dinosaurs.",
      "In January, British researchers unearthed some\u00a0200 dinosaur footprints\u00a0dating back 166 million years in a find believed to be the biggest in the United Kingdom.",
      "That discovery was announced just a few months after a team of paleontologists found\u00a0matching dinosaur footprints\u00a0on what are now two different continents, separated by thousands of miles of ocean.",
      "In October 2023, engineers in the U.K. made a\u00a0\"dramatic discovery\"\u00a0of dinosaur footprints that experts believe could be from a mantellisaurus, a type of dinosaur that had just three toes on each foot and traveled on its hind legs.",

    "summary": "A missing woman's phone has been found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
    "story": [
      "A missing woman's phone was found in Australia's Tasmanian wilderness over the weekend, more than two years after she disappeared, police said.",
      "An independent search party organized by Celine Cremer's friends and family found her phone on Saturday at a waterfall, Tasmania Police said in a statement. It was the first sign of Cremer ever located in the area where she went missing, aside from her car, which investigators discovered 10 days after the last confirmed sighting of her in Waratah, a town in the Australian island state of Tasmania.",
      "Tasmania Police said the phone will undergo further forensic examination and that they will now formally join the independent search for Cremer.",
      "Cremer, a Belgian woman, was last seen on June 17, 2023, in Waratah, according to police. Investigators believe that Cremer drove to Philosopher Falls, a waterfall surrounded by dense rainforest, and intended to set out for a short walk through the area.",
      "\"Unfortunately, she did not return,\" Tasmania Police inspector Andrew Hanson said in a statement.",
      "Her friends reported her disappearance to Tasmania Police on June 26, 2023, and the original search effort began the next day, police said.",
      "By then, the area had already experienced an intense spell of winter weather, including subzero temperatures, snow and rainfall. According to Hanson, medical experts at the time advised police that Cremer could not have survived so many days in the wilderness under those conditions.",
      "The initial search continued for two weeks, with no clues as to where Cremer might be, and follow-up searches over the years ended similarly. The recent discovery of Cremer's phone suggests that she may have veered off course during her walk around Philosopher Falls and lost her way.",
      "\"The phone was found in an area that has been extensively searched previously and phone data, as well as the location it was found, supports our theory that Celine may have, using an app on her phone, elected to leave the Philosopher Falls track to take more a direct route back to her car as daylight faded,\" said Hanson, adding: \"We suspect she dropped her phone and continued without it, becoming disoriented in dense terrain.\"",
      "A bout of harsh winter weather over the weekend postponed further search efforts, according to Tasmania Police, but Hanson said they planned to dispatch officers to the area as soon as those conditions cleared up.",
      "Police said that while they were not leading or coordinating the search that led to the phone's discovery, they \"had been supporting the effort by sharing information and advice about what to do should anything be discovered.\"",
      "The independent group of searchers included Cremer's friends and the adventure filmmaker Rob Parsons, who has posted videos of his own private attempts to search for Cremer on YouTube. He described the moment Cremer's phone was discovered in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.",
      "\"I don't think there was a dry eye in the area,\" Parsons told the news organization. \"Everyone was so emotional. Everything was building up to this point where her friends could be here for the discovery. It felt like it was meant to be.\"",

    "summary": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says a \"very workable\" peace plan to end the war in Ukraine could be presented to Russia within days.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says proposals being negotiated with U.S. officials for a peace deal to end his country's nearly four-year war with Russia are \"very workable\" and could be finalized within days, after which American envoys would present them to the Kremlin before further possible meetings in the United States next weekend.",
      "Zelenskyy warned late Monday that a draft peace plan discussed with the U.S. during talks in Berlin earlier in the day had not resolved some key issues, notably what happens to Ukrainian territory occupied by invading Russian forces.",
      "U.S-led peace efforts appear to be picking up momentum. But Russian President Vladimir Putin may balk at some of the proposals thrashed out by officials from Washington, Kyiv and Western Europe, including postwar security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov repeated Tuesday that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a temporary truce.",
      "If Ukraine seeks \"momentary, unsustainable solutions, we are unlikely to be ready to participate,\" Peskov said.",
      "\"We want peace - we don't want a truce that would give Ukraine a respite and prepare for the continuation of the war,\" he told reporters. \"We want to stop this war, achieve our goals, secure our interests, and guarantee peace in Europe for the future.\"",
      "American officials on Monday said that there's consensus from Ukraine and Europe on about 90% of the U.S.-authored peace plan. President Trump said, \"I think we're closer now than we have been, ever\" to a peace settlement.",
      "Plenty of potential pitfalls remain, however.",
      "Zelenskyy reiterated that Kyiv rules out recognizing Moscow's control over any part of the Donbas, an economically important region in eastern Ukraine made up of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia's army doesn't fully control either.",
      "\"The Americans are trying to find a compromise,\" Zelenskyy said before visiting the Netherlands on Tuesday. \"They are proposing a 'free economic zone' (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a 'free economic zone' does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\"",
      "The land issue remains one of the most difficult obstacles to a comprehensive agreement.",
      "Putin wants all the areas in four key regions that his forces have seized, as well as the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow illegally annexed in 2014, to be recognized as Russian territory.",
      "Zelenskyy warned that if Putin rejects diplomatic efforts, Ukraine expects increased Western pressure on Moscow, including tougher sanctions and additional military support for defense. Kyiv would seek enhanced air defense systems and long-range weapons if diplomacy collapses, he said.",
      "Ukraine and the U.S. are preparing up to five documents related to the peace framework, several of them focused on security, Zelenskyy said.",
      "U.K. Defense Secretary John Healey was upbeat about the progress in the Berlin talks. \"We are at a major moment in this war. The US-led push for peace is advancing, and yesterday in Berlin there were signals of a progress in the peace talks which is further advanced than at any time during this war,\" he said at a virtual meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group.",
      "Zelenskyy was also positive about the talks.",
      "\"Overall, there was a demonstration of unity,\" he said. \"It was truly positive in the sense that it reflected the unity of the U.S., Europe, and Ukraine.\"",
      "Speaking at the launch of the International Claims Commission for Ukraine in The Hague Tuesday, Zelenskyy added: \"As long as our people remain in Russian captivity and until the Ukrainian children abducted by Russia are brought home, sanctions must limit Russia, until it shows respect for peaceful for peaceful life and the rights of its neighbors. And of course, of course, every Russian war crime must have consequences for those who committed them.\"",

      "The U.S. military says it struck three more alleged drug-carrying boats in the Eastern Pacific on Monday, the latest in a campaign of vessel strikes ordered by the Trump administration that have killed at least 95 people in 25 boats.",
      "Monday's strikes killed eight men across three boats, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a post on X. It alleged the occupants were \"male narco-terrorists\" and the boats were \"transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and were engaged in narco-trafficking.\" The strike was authorized by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Southern Command said.",
      "Southern Command also posted a 47-second video that appeared to show three separate strikes on vessels.",

      "The U.S. military began striking boats in the Eastern Pacific and Caribbean in early September, part of what the Trump administration has described as a \"non-international armed conflict\" against drug cartels that it has designated as terror groups.",
      "The campaign is increasingly controversial, however. Democratic lawmakers and a handful of Republicans argue the Trump administration lacks legal authority to conduct the strikes and hasn't provided sufficient evidence that the boats were actually carrying narcotics.",
      "Meanwhile, a Sept. 2 strike that started off the campaign has drawn scrutiny after reports emerged that two people in the vessel survived the initial hit but were killed in a follow-on strike. Democrats who watched a video of the Sept. 2 operation decried the decision, and some critics have warned that killing shipwrecked survivors could constitute a war crime. Republicans have defended the follow-on strike, arguing the survivors may have still been in the fight.",
      "The boat strikes are part of a broader U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean and near Latin America, with several naval vessels \u2014 including the USS Gerald R. Ford \u2014 and fighter jets shifting to the region in recent months.",
      "The administration has heaped pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of collaborating with drug cartels, and it has also argued that Colombia has failed to crack down on drug trafficking. Both countries have criticized the boat strikes, and the Venezuelan government has accused the Trump administration of seeking regime change.",

They were very, very, very blunt with me and told me whether I was doing something good or bad. And that's the way you learn. And that's when I decided eventually that I was gonna be on camera after doing this, I was like, 'Well, I'm not gonna lie to anyone. I've gotta be honest with them.

      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Hirsch said American Jews are on edge after two gunmen killed 15 people and injured dozens more during a Bondi Beach Hanukkah celebration last weekend. Amid the global rise in antisemitism, Hirsch said politicians and \"every moral authority\" should express solidarity with the Jewish community and condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada.\"",
      "\"What does \u2018globalize the intifada\u2019 mean? It means Bondi Beach,\" Hirsch said, while urging \"every responsible political and moral authority\" to condemn the phrase that he described as a \"call to mass genocide.\"",
      "The term \"globalize the intidafa\" \u2014 which Hirsch said means \"destroy Israel\" \u2014 took center stage in New York City's mayoral election this year after Mamdani refused to condemn the phrase, arguing that he does not support policing language.

      "But Hirsch cautioned that \"even the rhetoric of anti-Zionism, let alone the pursuit of anti-Zionist policies, generates hostility to Jews and to the Jewish community.\"",
      "\"Therefore, even if you put 20 cops outside a Jewish institution, it will still be more dangerous for Jewish life, because the environment will be much more hostile,\" Hirsch added. \"And what happens to Jews never stays with the Jews. This is why it's an issue for everyone, for all New Yorkers, and for all Americans too, because New York is such an important component of American society, but if hostility to Jews grows, then the city itself will become more violent, a nastier place, a less tolerant place, a city that looks different from the city that we love.\"",
      "Hirsch made his comments to Fox News Digital less than one month after protesters gathered outside Manhattan\u2019s Park East Synagogue, calling for an \"intifada,\" for the death of Israel Defense Forces and chanting, \"We don't want no Zionists here.\"",

      "The unprecedented sale includes 82 HIMARS launchers paired with 420 ATACMS long-range missiles, a combination that would give Taiwan new deep-strike capability across the Taiwan Strait, along with 60 self-propelled howitzers, advanced UAV systems, military software packages and anti-armor weapons.",
      "Beijing accused Taiwan\u2019s leadership of \"seeking independence through force\" and claimed Washington is using the island to \"contain China,\" rhetoric that signals heightened tensions even as the U.S. frames the package as essential to bolstering Taiwan\u2019s self-defense.",

      "U.S. officials have not yet detailed delivery timelines, but the sale reflects Washington\u2019s push to accelerate Taiwan\u2019s defenses amid growing concern over China\u2019s military pressure campaign.

      "Recreational exoskeletons have been popping up for years, but the new IRMO M1 exoskeleton feels like a turning point. This next-generation wearable blends artificial intelligence (AI), a forward-facing camera, LADAR sensors and lightweight robotics to give your legs a serious boost on trails and city streets.",
      "It scans the terrain ahead and predicts how much assistance you will need before your foot lands, rather than waiting to react after impact. The result feels smoother and easier than many older systems that rely mainly on reactive support.",
      "IRMO spun out of research from Beihang University in Beijing. Its team built the M1 to act like an all-terrain, adaptive suspension system for your legs, tuned for real-world walking and hiking conditions. Early backers on its global crowdfunding campaign are already pushing the project toward major funding goals.",

      "The IRMO M1 reads the terrain ahead and gives your legs the support you need before each step. (IRMO)",
      "How the IRMO M1 exoskeleton boosts your stride",
      "The M1 straps onto your waist and legs with modular fast-release bands. Each leg module weighs between 2.2 and 2.6 pounds. A 1,000 W motor provides up to 45% assist on each stride. IRMO says the system can take as much as 50 pounds of stress off your knees, which can help reduce fatigue on long days outside.",
      "Inside the frame sits a nine-axis IMU paired with an AI engine that studies your gait in real time. This lets the M1 fine-tune each push as it learns how you move. That alone puts it in line with top performance exoskeletons, but IRMO adds something new that it says shifts the entire experience.",
      "Terrain-aware AI that looks ahead while you move",
      "The M1 scans a four-foot radius around you with camera and laser-rangefinder sensors. This lets it read the terrain before you reach it. The system adjusts power output based on what is coming up next. If the M1 detects stairs, grass, sand or slopes, it prepares your legs with added support or added control.",
      "It can help you climb with more power, absorb impact on jumps and steady your pace on steep declines. IRMO says this predictive shift can reduce knee impact by up to 60%. You can use the M1 for hiking, running, jumping, cycling and even sports like basketball or tennis. If you want to build strength, you can switch from assist to resistance mode.",

      "How to buy the IRMO M1",
      "You can buy the IRMO M1 through its Kickstarter campaign, which runs until early January 2026. Prices start at $399 for the M1 Neo tier and rise through several launch specials that offer different levels of power, weight and features. Higher tiers include models like the M1 Pro and M1 Ultra, which add stronger motors, lighter frames and longer battery performance. Each pledge level lists what comes in the box, including the main units, straps, charger, battery pack, user manual and packaging. Shipping is global with an estimated delivery window of May 2026.",
      "Since this is a crowdfunding project, you should review the refund rules, shipping details and risk notes before you back it.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you love the outdoors but feel the strain of long climbs or steep descents, this technology looks to help you reopen trails that once felt out of reach.

      "Any data breach affecting 1.6 million people is serious. It draws even more attention when it involves a company trusted to guard passwords. That is exactly what happened to LastPass.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office has fined LastPass about $1.6 million for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. Regulators say those failures allowed a hacker to access a backup database and put users at risk.",

      "CHECK IF YOUR PASSWORDS WERE STOLEN IN HUGE LEAK",
      "Why the LastPass breach still matters",
      "LastPass is one of the most widely used password managers in the world. It serves more than 20 million individual users and around 100,000 businesses. That popularity also makes it an attractive target for cybercriminals.",
      "The U.K. Information Commissioner's Office fined LastPass for security failures tied to its 2022 breach. (LaylaBird/Getty Images)",

      "The ICO now says the breach affected about 1.6 million U.K. users alone. That scope played a major role in the size of the fine.",
      "What regulators say went wrong",
      "According to the ICO, LastPass failed to put strong enough technical and security controls in place. Those gaps made it possible for attackers to reach a backup database that should have been better protected.",
      "The regulator added that LastPass promises to help people improve security, but failed to meet that expectation. As a result, users were left exposed even if their passwords were not directly cracked.",
      "Were passwords exposed or decrypted?",
      "There is still no evidence that attackers decrypted customer passwords. That point matters.",
      "Despite the breach, security experts continue to recommend password managers for most people. Storing unique, strong passwords in an encrypted vault is still far safer than reusing weak passwords across accounts.",
      "As one expert noted, modern breaches often succeed after identity access rather than password cracking alone. Once attackers get a foothold, the damage can spread quickly.",
      "Although attackers accessed a backup database, there is no evidence that customer passwords were decrypted. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the LastPass fine is a wake-up call for cybersecurity",
      "The ICO called the LastPass fine a turning point. It reinforces the idea that security is about governance, staff training and supplier risk as much as software.",

      "According to reports filed with the Texas attorney general's office, the exposed data included names, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial account details, credit or debit card numbers and dates of birth. Filings in California, Massachusetts and Montana confirm additional affected residents.",
      "In California, companies must report breaches involving at least 500 state residents. Petco did not disclose the exact number, which suggests the real total is higher. For context, Petco said in 2022 that it served more than 24 million customers.",
      "Petco says the company sent notifications to individuals whose information was involved. The sample notice released by the California attorney general explains that a software setting allowed certain files to be accessible online. Petco says it removed those files, corrected the setting and added new security measures.",
      "The company is offering free credit and identity theft monitoring to victims in California, Massachusetts and Montana. It is not clear if similar support is being offered to affected Texas residents.",
      "We reached out to Petco for comment, and a representative provided CyberGuy with the following statement,",
      "\"We recently identified a setting in one of our applications which inadvertently made certain Petco files accessible online. Upon identifying the issue, we took immediate steps to correct the error and began an investigation. We notified individuals whose information was involved and continue to monitor for further issues. We take this incident seriously. To help prevent something like this from happening again, we have taken and will continue to take steps to enhance the security of our network.\"",
      "What this breach means for you",
      "A breach that exposes government IDs, financial numbers and birth dates creates long-term risks. Criminals use this mix of information to open accounts, take over existing ones or try to pass identity checks. Even if no fraud happens right away, exposed data can sit in criminal markets for years.",
      "Ways to stay safe after a breach like this",
      "You can take several steps today that help lower your risk and protect your identity going forward.",
      "A freeze blocks new credit accounts in your name. It also stops criminals from opening loans or credit cards with your stolen information. You can freeze your credit for free at Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",

      "3) Turn on account alerts",
      "Set up alerts for banking, credit cards and online shopping accounts. Alerts help you spot suspicious activity fast.",
      "Strong passwords protect you from credential stuffing attacks. This happens when criminals take stolen passwords from one breach and try them on other sites. A password manager creates unique passwords for every account and helps you stop those attacks before they start.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

    "summary": "Baseball teams can now analyze complete swing mechanics in normal training environments using Theia&apos;s markerless AI system that processes standard high-speed footage.",
    "story": [
      "John Hankins, co-owner and co-investor of PitchCom, tells Fox News Digital that the idea for the communication device came from the Houston Astros' sign-stealing scandal.",
      "Baseball teams have long searched for a way to study the entire swing without sensors or complex lab setups. Today, a new solution is entering the picture. Theia, an AI biomechanics company, debuted a commercially available video-only system that analyzes bat trajectory and full-body biomechanics together. This new approach works in real baseball environments and needs no reflective body markers, wearables or special equipment.",
      "The system has been field-tested by Driveline Baseball and the San Diego Padres Biomechanics Lab, and the tests show it delivers high-quality results in both cages and on the field.",

      "MLB VOTES TO ALLOW ROBOT UMPS FOR CHALLENGES DURING 2026 SEASON",
      "Theia unveils a video-only biomechanics system that tracks a hitter\u2019s full swing without sensors or lab gear. (Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images)",
      "A new chapter in baseball biomechanics",
      "Theia's platform relies on deep-learning models trained on millions of movement data points. It captures the full 3D bat path, attack angle, sequencing and body motion in one workflow that teams can run with standard high-speed video. This makes advanced biomechanics more accessible to coaches and players who train in normal environments.",
      "Dr. Arnel Aguinaldo of the PLNU Biomechanics Lab tested the system with the Padres. He said, \"Theia's markerless technology represents a breakthrough in how we capture and analyze swing mechanics. It removes the barriers of traditional setups, letting us gather quality swing data directly from the field or the cage. That's a game changer for both research and applied development.\"",
      "Independent testing across more than 2,000 swings showed median bat-plane angle differences of less than 3 degrees compared with marker-based systems. As a result, teams can evaluate roster-sized groups in routine cage or field sessions without slowing players down.",
      "Why video-only tracking works in real baseball settings",
      "Many existing tools rely on sensors or suits that can change how an athlete moves. Marcus Brown, CEO of Theia, explained to CyberGuy why video-only tracking matters.",
      "\"Using only video means teams get lab-grade biomechanics data that previously required a full lab setup, but without special suits, reflective markers, or hardware mounted to the bat or the player,\" he said.",
      "The system runs in the background once cameras are placed and calibrated. Coaches record sessions as usual, and the analysis processes automatically. Because of this, training routines stay the same, and players move naturally.",
      "Brown added,\u00a0\"Until now, full swing analysis meant choosing between bat-only tools or biomechanics labs that couldn't scale. Our new markerless technology changes that. Teams can now see the complete swing picture for every hitter using one system in an environment that matches their individual needs.\"",
      "How AI bat and body tracking improves player performance",
      "A complete swing view gives coaches the chance to link body motion to bat results. Brown described why this matters for player development.",
      "\"Theia's new bat tracking feature helps players improve because it gives coaches a complete and more accurate picture of the swing. Many tools today either measure the bat or the body, and many rely on wearables or sensors that can influence how an athlete moves,\" Brown said. \"When coaches can connect a player's sequencing, posture, timing, and rotation to the bat's path, speed, and contact quality, they can identify the specific movement patterns that drive results. That makes mechanical adjustments more targeted and much easier to track over time, leading to more consistent and meaningful improvements.\"",

      "Driveline Baseball and the Padres Biomechanics Lab report strong accuracy from Theia\u2019s markerless tracking tests. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)",
      "What players experience when teams use Theia's system",
      "Players will not need to attach anything to the bat or their bodies. They swing in their regular training spaces without changing behavior. Brown said, \"For athletes, the biggest change is the level of precise personalized feedback they get. Coaches can isolate whether an issue is coming from sequencing, posture, timing, or how the hitter is delivering the barrel to the ball. That level of detail helps translate mechanical work in the cage into more consistent, reliable results in the field.\"",
      "Independent testing shows consistent bat and body data",
      "Driveline Baseball and the PLNU x Padres Biomechanics Lab tested the system in both professional and collegiate settings. Brown said,\u00a0\"Our work with Driveline and the PLNUxPadres' Biomechanics Lab showed the system could deliver high-quality bat-and-body data in the same environments where hitters actually train. What those tests demonstrated was consistency: the ability to capture the full swing automatically, link the bat and body with the precision needed for player development, and fit seamlessly into a normal training session.\"",
      "Why Theia's system fits seamlessly into normal cage sessions",
      "Sports tech can create workflow friction, but Theia aims to avoid that. Brown said, \"We designed the system so coaches can use it without changing anything about their normal training routine. Once the cameras are in place, coaches simply record the session the same way they normally would, and the analysis happens automatically in the background.\"",
      "There are no extra steps, no equipment put on the players, and no training interruptions.",

      "Coaches can now review 3D bat paths and body sequencing using standard high-speed video. (Photo by Thien-An Truong/Getty Images)",
      "The road ahead for AI sports performance",
      "Brown believes this breakthrough sets the stage for future innovation.",
      "\"Player development is ultimately about understanding what drives performance, and this technology gives coaches a far clearer way to see that,\" he said. \"When you can connect a player's movement to the result of the swing with objective repeatable data, you can build training plans that are far more individualized and precise.\"",
      "He also added:\u00a0\"This work builds on more than a decade of research and over 50 peer-reviewed validation studies focused on highly accurate markerless human motion tracking. It reflects where the field as a whole is headed toward integrated markerless solutions that give athletes and coaches clearer insight with far less friction.\"",

Stories like that make you picture cybercriminals breaking into homes with high-tech gadgets and spying on families through smart cams. That reaction is natural. But most of these headlines leave out important context that can help you breathe a little easier.",
      "First, smart home hacking is rare. Most incidents stem from weak passwords or from someone you already know, rather than from a stranger with advanced tools. Today's smart home brands push out updates to block intrusion attempts, including patches for new AI-related vulnerabilities that often make headlines.",

      "Smart home hacking headlines can look scary, but most threats come from weak passwords rather than targeted attacks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why criminals are not circling your house with hacking gear",
      "Many people imagine cybercriminals driving around neighborhoods with scanners that look for vulnerable devices. In reality, Wi-Fi ranges and technical limits make that nearly impossible. Even high-profile hacks of casinos and large companies do not translate to criminals trying to breach residential smart locks for petty theft.",
      "Burglars still choose low-tech methods. They look for unlocked doors or easy entry points. They avoid complicated hacking tools because the payoff is too small to justify the work.",
      "So how do smart homes get hacked? Here are the real attack paths and how they work.",
      "Common ways smart homes get attacked",
      "Smart homes face a handful of digital threats, but most come from broad automated attacks rather than someone targeting your house.",
      "Bots constantly scan the internet for weak passwords and outdated logins. These brute force attacks throw billions of guesses at connected accounts. When one works, the device becomes part of a botnet used for future attacks. That doesn't mean someone is targeting your home on purpose. Bots search for anything they can breach. A strong password stops them.",
      "Some phishing emails impersonate smart home brands. Clicking a fake link or sharing login details can open the door for criminals to reach your network. Even a general phishing attack can expose your Wi-Fi info and lead to broader access.",
      "Hackers often go after company servers, not individual homes. These breaches may expose account details or stored camera footage kept in the cloud. Criminals may sell that data to others who might try to use it. It rarely leads to direct smart home hacking, but it still puts your accounts at risk.",
      "Early IoT devices had vulnerabilities that allowed criminals to intercept the data they sent and received. (IoT stands for Internet of Things and includes everyday connected gadgets like smart plugs, smart thermostats or Wi-Fi cameras.) Modern products now use stronger encryption, making these attacks extremely rare in the real world.",
      "Bluetooth issues still pop up from time to time, but most modern smart home devices use stronger security than older models. When a new flaw is discovered, companies usually release fast patches, which is why it's important to keep your apps and gadgets updated. Today, these Bluetooth risks rarely lead to real smart home problems.",

      "Simple steps like stronger Wi-Fi security and regular updates go a long way toward protecting connected devices. (\u00a0Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Exes, former roommates or relatives often know login info. They may try to spy or cause trouble. Update all passwords if you suspect this.",
      "There have been cases where employees at security companies snooped through camera feeds. This isn't remote hacking. It's a misuse of internal access.",
      "They steal account lists and login details to sell. Others may buy those lists and try to log in using exposed credentials.",
      "Some send fake messages claiming they hacked your cameras and threaten you. Most of these scams rely on lies because they have no access at all.",
      "Some banned foreign manufacturers pose surveillance risks. The FCC maintains a list of companies that cannot sell security tech in the U.S. Always check that list before buying unfamiliar brands.",
      "Smart home devices that can raise concerns",
      "Some everyday gadgets create small but real entry points for trouble, especially when their settings or security features get overlooked.",
      "They often arrive with default passwords that owners forget to change. Older models may use outdated IoT protocols with weaker protections. Many do not get frequent security updates.",
      "Wi-Fi offers convenience but also adds risk. Weak routers and poor passwords can allow strangers to access a feed. Closed network monitors avoid Wi-Fi risks but still face basic signal interception attempts.",
      "During setup, some bulbs broadcast an open temporary network. If a criminal joins at the exact right moment, they could reach the rest of your devices. These cases are rare but possible in theory.",
      "Voice ordering can be exploited by curious kids or guests. Set a purchase PIN so no one can order items with simple voice commands.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Managing diabetes already brings stress from medications and long-term health risks. Regular glucose checks only add to the weight. Most people test with finger pricks or wear a patch that needs a sensor under the skin. If you dislike needles, this part can feel like the hardest task of the day.",
      "Researchers at MIT are working on a new option. They developed a device that shines near-infrared light on your skin and reads your blood sugar without breaking the surface. It works through Raman spectroscopy, a method that looks at how light scatters when it hits molecules in your tissue.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "MIT\u2019s light-based scanner reads blood sugar through the skin without a single prick. (iStock)",
      "CANCER CURES COULD BE IN REACH WITH CUTTING-EDGE MEDICAL TECH, DOCTOR PREDICTS",
      "How the light-based scanner works",
      "The current setup is about the size of a shoebox. You rest your arm on top for a 30-second scan. A small beam shines through a glass window onto your skin. The light returns with tiny shifts in wavelength that reveal what molecules are present.",
      "Earlier Raman systems pulled in about 1,000 spectral bands with plenty of noise. The MIT team discovered that they only need three bands to calculate glucose levels. With fewer signals to process, the device becomes smaller, faster and more affordable. This boost also improves speed since the system no longer sorts through redundant data.",
      "In a four-hour study, a volunteer drank two glucose drinks while researchers took readings every five minutes. The new scanner matched the accuracy of two commercial glucometers the participant wore. That result surprised the team since the device is still in early development.",
      "Progress toward a wearable",
      "After perfecting the shoebox version, MIT engineers built a prototype the size of a cellphone. That unit is now in clinical testing with healthy and prediabetic volunteers. A larger trial with people who have diabetes is expected next year.",
      "The long-term goal is even more exciting. Researchers believe they can shrink the hardware to a watch size. They also want to confirm that the system reads accurately across many skin tones. If these steps succeed, a wrist-based glucose monitor could be possible.",
      "A quick 30-second scan can match the accuracy of today\u2019s commercial glucose monitors. (iStock)",
      "How this compares to other needle-free attempts",
      "This light-based method joins other ideas that try to move past needles. A recent chest strap used ECG signals to predict glucose levels. It looked promising, but it still needs time before it reaches consumers. Interest in noninvasive monitoring keeps growing since so many people want relief from the pain of repeated skin punctures or adhesive patches.",
      "HUMANOID ROBOT PERFORMS MEDICAL PROCEDURES VIA REMOTE CONTROL",
      "What this means to you",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals keep getting better at blending into the software you use every day.",
      "Over the past few years, we've seen phishing pages that copy banking portals, fake browser alerts that claim your device is infected and \"human verification\" screens that push you to run commands you should never touch. The latest twist comes from the ongoing ClickFix campaign.",
      "Instead of asking you to prove you are human, attackers now disguise themselves as a Windows update. It looks convincing enough that you might follow the instructions without thinking, which is exactly what they want.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "NEW SCAM SENDS FAKE MICROSOFT 365 LOGIN PAGES",
      "The malware hides inside seemingly normal image files, using steganography to slip past traditional security tools.\u00a0 (Microsoft)",
      "How the fake update works",
      "Researchers noticed that ClickFix has upgraded its old trick. The campaign used to rely on human verification pages, but now you get a full-screen Windows update screen that looks almost identical to the real thing. Joe Security showed how the page displays fake progress bars, familiar update messages and a prompt that tells you to complete a critical security update.",
      "If you are on Windows, the site tells you to open the Run box, copy something from your clipboard and paste it in. That \"something\" is a command that silently downloads a malware dropper. The final payload is usually an infostealer, which steals passwords, cookies and other data from your machine.",
      "NEW EMAIL SCAM USES HIDDEN CHARACTERS TO SLIP PAST FILTERS",
      "Fake update screens are getting harder to spot as attackers mimic Windows with near-perfect precision. (Joe Security)",
      "The moment you paste the command, the infection chain begins. First, a file called mshta.exe reaches out to a remote server and grabs a script. To avoid detection, these URLs often use hex encoding for parts of the address and rotate their paths. The script then runs obfuscated PowerShell code filled with junk instructions to throw researchers off. Once PowerShell does its work, it decrypts a hidden .NET assembly that functions as the loader.",
      "Why is this attack so hard to detect?",
      "The loader hides its next stage inside what looks like a regular PNG file. ClickFix uses custom steganography, which is a technique that hides secret data inside normal-looking content. In this case, the malware sits inside the image's pixel data. The attackers tweak color values in certain pixels, especially in the red channel, to embed pieces of shellcode. When you view the image, everything appears normal.",
      "The script knows exactly where the hidden data sits. It extracts the pixel values, decrypts them and rebuilds the malware directly in memory. That means nothing obvious is written to disk. Security tools that rely on file scanning miss it, since the shellcode never appears as a standalone file.",
      "Once rebuilt, the shellcode is injected into a trusted Windows process like explorer.exe. The attack uses familiar in-memory techniques such as VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread. Recent ClickFix activity has delivered infostealers like LummaC2 and updated versions of Rhadamanthys. These tools are built to harvest credentials and send them back to the attacker with very little noise.",
      "Once the hidden code loads into a trusted Windows process, infostealers quietly begin harvesting your data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself from the ClickFix campaign",
      "The best way to stay protected is to slow down for a moment and follow a few steps that cut off these attacks before they start.",
      "If any site tells you to paste a command into Run, PowerShell or Terminal, treat it as an immediate warning sign. Real operating system updates never require you to run commands from a webpage. When you run that command, you hand full control to the attacker. If something feels off, close the page and don't interact further.",
      "Updates should only come from the Windows Settings app or through official system notifications. A browser tab or pop-up pretending to be a Windows update is always fake. If you see anything outside the normal update flow asking for your action, ignore it and check the real Windows Update page yourself.",
      "Choose a security suite that can detect both file-based and in-memory threats. Stealthy attacks like ClickFix avoid leaving obvious files for scanners to pick up. Tools with behavioral detection, sandboxing and script monitoring give you a much better chance of spotting unusual activity early.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Password managers create strong, unique passwords for every account you use. They also autofill only on legitimate websites, which helps you catch fake login pages. If a manager refuses to fill out your credentials, take a second look at the URL before entering anything manually.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many attacks start by targeting emails and personal details already exposed online. Data removal services help shrink your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from data broker sites that collect and sell your information. They can't erase everything, but reducing your exposure means fewer attackers have easy access to your details.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A convincing layout doesn't mean it is legitimate. Always look at the domain name first. If it doesn't match the official site or uses odd spelling or extra characters, close it. Attackers rely on the fact that people recognize a page's design but ignore the address bar.",
      "Fake update pages often run in full-screen mode to hide the browser interface and make the page look like part of your computer. If a site suddenly goes full screen without your permission, exit with Esc or Alt+Tab. Once you're out, scan your system and don't return to that page.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "ClickFix works because it leans on user interaction. Nothing happens unless you follow the instructions on the screen. That makes the fake Windows update page especially dangerous, because it taps into something most people trust. If you are used to Windows updates freezing your screen, you may not question a prompt that appears during the process. Cybercriminals know this. They copy trusted interfaces to lower your guard and then rely on you to run the final command. The technical tricks that follow are complex, but the starting point is simple. They need you to help them.",

      "A futuristic food dome at Expo 2025 Osaka-Kansai offered a surprising look at how cities may grow fresh food close to home.",
      "Inspired by a classic greenhouse, the Inochi no Izumi or Source of Life dome showed how a compact closed-loop ecosystem could sit on rooftops or in small urban spaces. It looked like a tiny house full of produce powered by nature.",

      "This dome creates a full food ecosystem by recycling water and nutrients in a closed loop. (VikingDome)",
      "Inside the Source of Life dome",
      "The 21-foot structure sits on a base with four water zones that support marine fish, brackish species and freshwater species. Their waste creates the nutrients that feed the plant layers above. Microbes convert ammonia into nitrates that plants love.",
      "Above the tanks are four hydroponic tiers. Salt-tolerant greens grow over the seawater tank. Tomatoes and semi-salt-tolerant veggies thrive in the brackish zone. Herbs and lettuce sit above freshwater species like sturgeon. Edible flowers fill the top layer where sunlight hits strongest. The layout functions like an ecological slice from ocean to land instead of floors.",

      "Plants grow in stacked hydroponic layers that match the salinity zones of the aquatic life below. (VikingDome)",
      "How cities may use systems like this",
      "If these domes scale, cities could spread food production across many rooftops instead of one large farm. That shift boosts resilience and reduces shipping. It also lets people see where their food comes from, because it grows within reach.",
      "Why this dome matters",
      "The dome shows how biodiversity can improve food production. With more plant and aquatic species working together, the system stays stable and feeds itself. It does not rely on soil, open land or predictable weather. Cities with tight spaces can use this kind of setup to grow food right where people live.",
      "Researchers from Osaka Metropolitan University and the Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology designed the system to copy nature. It follows the same recycling found in healthy wetlands. By letting biology do the work, the system reduces strain on land and water.",
      "The system shows how cities may produce fresh food on rooftops and small urban spaces. (VikingDome)",
      "What this means for you",
      "This model hints at a future where fresh food sits closer to your kitchen. A dome like this could sit on an apartment building or a school and provide herbs, produce and edible flowers. It cuts travel time from farm to table and gives communities more control over their food supply.",
      "If a storm or disaster blocks access to farms, a closed-loop dome can keep growing. For people with tiny yards or no soil, it offers a realistic way to produce clean food in small spaces.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Source of Life dome may be a prototype, but it delivers a vivid preview of urban food production.

      "Walshe previously entered a surprise guilty plea for lying to police and unlawful disposal of a body during jury selection. Sentencing for all three took place at the same time, and Judge Diane Freniere gave him credit for about 1,000 days time served.",
      "Brian made a series of incriminating internet searches on Jan. 1, 2023, which were presented in court, and included \"how long for someone to be missing to inherit,\" \"best way to dispose of a body\" and \"best way to dispose of body parts after a murder.\"",

      "Brian Walshe is sentenced in Norfolk Superior Court to a mandatory sentence of life without parole. (Mark Stockwell/Boston Herald via Pool)",
      "Prosecutors had alleged two potential motives in the slaying. The first was anger over an affair that Ana was having with a Washington, D.C., realtor, whose name Walshe had searched for.",
      "The second was because he allegedly believed he would have a better chance of avoiding prison in an unrelated art fraud case if his wife were out of the picture, and he was the only caretaker for their three children.",

      "BROOKLINE, Mass. \u2014 A world-renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) professor and fusion-energy physicist was shot and killed inside his home earlier this week, an attack that has rattled one of the country\u2019s most elite scientific communities.",
      "Nuno F. Gomes Loureiro, 47, was a professor of nuclear science and engineering and the director of MIT\u2019s Plasma Science and Fusion Center. Loureiro was a renowned figure in fusion-energy research, a field that seeks to recreate the power of the sun inside fusion reactors on Earth.

      "Originally from Portugal, Loureiro studied in his home country, in the United Kingdom and in the United States, where he researched topics including the phenomenon behind solar flares. He also focused on plasma \u2014 a super-hot form of matter found in stars and in experimental fusion reactors.",
      "Fusion is the process that makes the sun burn and Loureiro\u2019s work explored how that power could be bottled on Earth and controlled inside those reactors. If fusion ever becomes a real source of cheap, clean electricity, it will rely on the kind of physics he helped explain.",

      "\"I'm concerned because he was a human being, first, and secondly, because he's a scientist, and I know how much we invest in training people so they can make major contributions to our society, and then when they're murdered, it's a tremendous compromise to our community and to the world at large,\" Taylor said.",

      "Ghislaine Maxwell is asking a federal judge to throw out her conviction, claiming in a newly filed petition that juror misconduct, suppressed evidence and behind-the-scenes coordination between prosecutors and victims\u2019 lawyers corrupted the trial that put her behind bars.",
      "Maxwell, the longtime associate and convicted accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, filed the sweeping habeas motion pro se on Wednesday, arguing that \"newly discovered evidence\" proves she never received a fair trial. The 63-year-old is serving a 20-year prison sentence after her 2021 conviction on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges tied to Epstein\u2019s decades-long abuse network.",

      "A central claim in Maxwell's latest petition targets Juror No. 50, who publicly revealed after the verdict that he had been sexually abused as a child, a detail he did not disclose on his juror questionnaire.",
      "Maxwell said the omission was intentional and improperly influenced the deliberations, and she suggested other jurors may also have withheld similar personal histories. Federal courts have previously ruled that the juror\u2019s error did not justify a new trial, but Maxwell argued new statements contradict earlier findings and warrant renewed scrutiny.",
      "Maxwell also challenged the authenticity of physical evidence used at trial, particularly the massage table introduced to establish the interstate commerce element of the charges. She claimed newly unsealed grand jury testimony conflicts with law enforcement accounts of how and where the table was seized and points to labeling and paperwork discrepancies that, she argues, raise questions about whether the exhibit shown to jurors was the same item recovered in the 2005 Palm Beach search.",
      "The petition further accuses prosecutors of withholding exculpatory material, including internal FBI notes, grand jury records and information about Epstein\u2019s properties and financial transactions. Maxwell contends that access to this material would have allowed her defense to more aggressively challenge key witnesses and the government\u2019s theory of the case.",

      "Maxwell also alleges that private attorneys representing Epstein\u2019s accusers played an unusual and inappropriate role in shaping the prosecution\u2019s approach. According to the filing, these lawyers worked closely with federal authorities, supplied investigative materials, communicated with witnesses and helped influence the development of the case before trial.",
      "The petition again raises Maxwell\u2019s long-standing argument that Epstein\u2019s 2007 non-prosecution agreement in Florida should have shielded her from federal charges.",
      "She claims newly surfaced internal documents show the agreement was intended to cover \"potential co-conspirators,\" including her, and asserts that prosecutors concealed drafts and communications that would have supported her position. Courts, however, have repeatedly rejected the argument that the Florida deal barred her prosecution in New York.",
      "Maxwell also points to confidential civil settlements involving other individuals linked to Epstein, arguing that more prominent figures escaped scrutiny while she became the centerpiece of the government\u2019s case.",

But the latest escalation by the Trump administration \u2014 including the seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker and the enforcement of a blockade on sanctioned vessels \u2014 has hit the regime where it is most vulnerable: its oil trade.",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, told Fox News Digital that while the timeline and outcome remain uncertain, the regime\u2019s dependence on oil leaves it uniquely vulnerable. \"One thing is clear: the Maduro regime can\u2019t sustain itself without oil revenue,\" she said.",
      "While the U.S. move has raised concerns among European allies, who warned that the escalation could undermine regional stability and complicate efforts toward a political resolution in Venezuela, Ford Maldonado says the administration\u2019s approach is striking at the core of Maduro\u2019s power.",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Rich Edson joins \u2018Fox & Friends\u2019 with details on President Donald Trump\u2019s upcoming national address and his move to designate Nicolas Maduro's regime as a foreign terrorist organization.",
      "The Trump administration has moved its hemispheric security doctrine into full force in Venezuela, ordering a sweeping naval blockade on sanctioned oil tankers and labeling Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s government a Foreign Terrorist Organization \u2014 a dramatic escalation aimed at choking off the regime\u2019s primary source of revenue and confronting what the White House calls a growing threat of cartel-driven \"drug terrorism\" and foreign influence in the region.",
      "Announcing the move on social media, Trump said Venezuela was now \"completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the history of South America,\" a strike at an oil sector that accounts for roughly 88% of the country\u2019s export earnings.",
      "The administration\u2019s new National Security Strategy (NSS) places the Western Hemisphere at the center of U.S. national security planning, elevating regional instability, mass migration, cartels and foreign influence as direct challenges to American security. While the document does not single out Venezuela by name, its framework positions crises like Venezuela\u2019s collapse as central to protecting what the strategy calls America\u2019s \"immediate security perimeter.\"",
      "MADURO\u2019S FORCES FACE RENEWED SCRUTINY AS US TENSIONS RISE: \u2018A FORTRESS BUILT ON SAND\u2019",
      "According to the NSS, U.S. policy toward the hemisphere now focuses on preventing large-scale migration, countering \"narco-terrorists, cartels, and other transnational criminal organizations,\" and ensuring the region remains \"reasonably stable and well-governed enough to prevent and discourage mass migration.\" It also pledges to assert a \"Trump Corollary\" to the Monroe Doctrine, aimed at blocking \"hostile foreign incursion or ownership of key assets\" by strategic competitors.",
      "A senior White House official said the Western Hemisphere chapter is designed to \"reassert American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere\" by strengthening regional security partnerships, curbing drug flows and preventing pressures that fuel mass migration. The official said the strategy situates the hemisphere as a foundational element of U.S. defense and prosperity.",
      "Newly released footage shows U.S. forces securing a Venezuelan oil tanker. (@AGPamBondi via X)",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said the NSS reflects what the administration sees as a historic realignment of U.S. foreign policy. \"President Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy builds upon the historic achievements of his first year back in office, which has seen his Administration move with historic speed to restore American strength at home and abroad and bring peace to the world,\" Kelly told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"In less than a year, President Trump has ended eight wars, persuaded Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defense, facilitated U.S.-made weapons sales to NATO allies, negotiated fairer trade deals, obliterated Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, and more.\" The strategy, she added, is designed to ensure \"America remains the greatest and most successful nation in human history.\"",
      "Melissa Ford Maldonado, director of the Western Hemisphere Initiative at the America First Policy Institute, said Venezuela illustrates why the hemisphere is now treated as America\u2019s \"first line of defense.\"",
      "\"The Maduro regime functions as a narco-dictatorship closely tied to criminal cartels, which are now considered foreign terror organizations, and supported by China, Iran and Russia,\" she said. \"Confronting this criminal regime is about keeping poison off our streets and chaos off our shores.\"",

      "She called the NSS \"the most radical and long-overdue change in U.S. foreign policy in a generation,\" arguing that instability in Latin America now reaches the United States \"in real time\" through migration surges, narcotics trafficking and foreign intelligence networks.",
      "Some analysts caution that the strategy\u2019s sharper posture could become destabilizing if pressure escalates into a confrontation.",
      "Roxanna Vigil, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the path ahead depends heavily on how forceful the administration\u2019s approach becomes. \"If it goes in the direction of escalation and conflict, that means there\u2019s going to be very little control,\" she said. \"If there is a power vacuum, who fills it?\"",

      "Jason Marczak, vice president of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, said the NSS underscores why the administration views Maduro\u2019s continued rule as incompatible with its regional priorities.",
      "\"All of those goals cannot be accomplished as long as Nicol\u00e1s Maduro or anybody close to him remains in power,\" he said, pointing to the strategy\u2019s focus on migration, regional security and countering foreign influence. \"Venezuela is a conduit for foreign influence in the hemisphere.\"",

      "Both Marczak and Vigil noted that the danger extends beyond Maduro to the criminal ecosystem and foreign partnerships that sustain his rule.

Within this framework, experts say the consequences of inaction could create security risks that extend well beyond Venezuela\u2019s borders.",

It highlights expanded counter-narcotics operations off Venezuela\u2019s coast, including airstrikes on maritime vessels linked to organizations such as Tren de Aragua and the National Liberation Army. The campaign, called Operation Southern Spear, is described as underscoring a commitment to \"defending the homeland from the influx of fentanyl and other illicit drugs ravaging American communities.\"",
      "The administration also raised the U.S. reward for information leading to the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to $50 million, citing a public announcement from Attorney General Pam Bondi accusing Maduro of central involvement in narcotics trafficking.

      "FIRST ON FOX: Senior Israeli intelligence officials say warnings delivered to Australia ahead of a deadly attack at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney\u2019s Bondi Beach were part of a much broader alert: an accelerating global rise in attempts to execute terror attacks across Western countries, increasingly aimed not only at Jewish targets, but also at Christians and large gatherings especially during religious holidays.",

      "\"If you knew how many terror attacks we exposed and prevented,\" the senior official said, \"your jaw would drop.\"",
      "Israeli intelligence officials say the rise in attempted attacks is driven in part by how extremist and state-linked networks build terror infrastructure globally while deliberately masking their origins.",
      "Officials say the networks frequently rely on non-Iranian nationals to carry out different roles along the operational chain, including logistics, intelligence gathering, financing and execution, in order to blur any connection to Tehran. In some cases, operatives are recruited from migrant or refugee backgrounds, while in others criminal elements or hired proxies are used to carry out acts of violence.",

In other cases, instructions are delivered remotely through secure channels that bypass standard telecommunications monitoring.",
      "According to Israeli assessments, extremist networks are increasingly overlapping: jihadist ideology, lone-actor violence and state-linked activity now exist in the same ecosystem, fueled by online radicalization and geopolitical instability.

      "That deal means the U.S. version of TikTok will become majority-owned by American investors, according to a memo obtained by NBC News.",

      "Under a bipartisan law passed by Congress, ByteDance was required to divest majority ownership of the U.S. version of the app or face a ban initially set to go into effect in January 2024.",
      "In January, as Donald Trump was preparing to return to office as president, the Supreme Court upheld the law. It rejected TikTok's argument that an outright ban would violate free speech protections.",
      "On Jan. 18, TikTok went offline for U.S. users for about 24 hours, causing an uproar among its millions of loyal fans and influential content creators.",

      "The formally signed agreement is the latest sign of a slow thaw underway in the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.",
      "Initially, little progress was made despite multiple meetings between Bessent and his Chinese counterparts.",

      "Changing the classification to Schedule III would ease regulatory hurdles and allow the FDA to study medical applications for cannabis, potentially opening it up for wider medical use by seniors, veterans and others as a pharmaceutical, irrespective of state laws.",

      "The order also specifically addresses CBD \u2014 cannabidiol \u2014 which is derived from hemp plants and does not cause a high by itself. It directs the White House deputy chief of staff for legislative, political and public affairs to work with Congress to allow people in the U.S. to benefit from access to CBD products while still restricting sale and access to products that pose serious health risks, the administration official said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., a staunch Trump critic, called the move \"a step in the right direction\" on X but added that \"more work must be done to decriminalize cannabis, ease overly restrictive banking regulations that stall industry progress in states where it is legal, and rectify the harms done by the War on Drugs.\"",

      "The Trump administration announced Thursday that it would begin to take steps aimed at ending transition-related care \u2014 or what the Department of Health and Human Services has termed \u201csex-rejecting procedures\u201d \u2014 for minors nationwide.",
      "The proposals \u2014 which, if enacted, would pull federal funding from hospitals that offer transgender care to minors \u2014 are the latest effort by the administration to restrict access to certain transgender care.",
      "Doctors across the country \u201cprovide needless and irreversible sex-rejecting procedures that violate their sacred Hippocratic Oath, endangering the very lives that they are sworn to safeguard,\u201d Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said at a news conference Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics lie that chemical and surgical sex-rejecting procedures could be good for children who suffer from gender dysphoria,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThis is not medicine, it is malpractice.\u201d",
      "Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an emailed statement that the HHS \u201cpolicies and proposals misconstrue the current medical consensus and fail to reflect the realities of pediatric care and the needs of children and families.\u201d",
      "\u201cAllowing the government to determine which patient groups deserve care sets a dangerous precedent,\u201d Kressly said. \u201cChildren and families will bear the consequences.\u201d",
      "HHS said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services will begin the rulemaking process to prohibit hospitals\u2019 providing puberty blockers, hormone therapy and operations to minors as a condition of participation in Medicare and Medicaid and to bar Medicaid funding from being used for such care.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re announcing a notice of proposed rulemaking that ends taxpayer funding of sex-rejecting procedures for children in Medicaid and CHIP, full stop,\u201d said CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let taxpayer money go to hurt these children.\u201d The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program is a federally funded program for uninsured kids.",
      "Dr. Kenneth Haller, a pediatrician based in St. Louis, called HHS\u2019 actions \u201canti-science\u201d at a briefing Tuesday held by the Human Rights Campaign, the nation\u2019s largest LGBTQ advocacy group. He said efforts to restrict access to such care still allow the treatments for children with other conditions that affect hormone production, for example.",
      "As long as the treatments affirm a child\u2019s birth gender, Haller said, \u201cthese people don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d He added, \u201cThat same care for kids who are transgender is what they say is wrong. There\u2019s no science behind it.\u201d",
      "HHS also announced that the Food and Drug Administration will issue warning letters to 12 manufacturers and retailers of breast binders for minors for the purposes of treating gender dysphoria, which is the distress that results from a misalignment between a person\u2019s gender identity and birth sex, alleging that the manufacturers are participating in illegal marketing.",
      "HHS\u2019 Office for Civil Rights proposed a revision to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, which prohibits discrimination in federally funded programs, to clarify that the definitions of \u201cdisability\u201d exclude gender dysphoria that does not result from physical impairments. The proposed revision \"clarifies\" for HHS funding recipients that \"policies preventing or limiting sex-rejecting procedures do not violate Section 504\u2019s disability nondiscrimination requirements,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The proposed CMS rules and revision to Section 504 will be finalized after a 60-day and 30-day comment period, respectively, according to an HHS spokesman.",
      "The Trump administration has worked to restrict access to transgender care since President Donald Trump returned to office in January.",
      "In the first few weeks of his second term, President Donald Trump issued multiple executive orders targeting trans people, including an order declaring that there are only two unchangeable sexes and another barring federal funding from going to hospitals that provide transition-related care to minors. In May, HHS released a review declaring that the quality of evidence regarding the effects of gender-affirming care for minors \u201cis very low,\u201d breaking with the majority of U.S. medical associations, which support access to such care and have condemned efforts to restrict it.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s policies built on an increasingly restrictive environment for trans care. In the last few years, 27 states have enacted measures prohibiting access to certain transition-related treatments for minors, according to Movement Advancement Project, an LGBTQ think tank. Families who could afford it began traveling to the remaining states where care remained legal.",
      "But in July, the federal government began investigating providers across the country, resulting in more than 20 hospitals \u2014 including those in liberal cities such as Los Angeles and Boston \u2014 rolling back or ending their gender-affirming care programs for minors and some young adults.",
      "The environment has led some trans adults and families with trans children, like the Gonzales\u2019, to leave the country. Rachel Gonzales\u2019 three children are fifth-generation Texans, and she has been fighting anti-trans legislation in the state since her trans daughter, Libby, was 6 years old. For years, she has said they had no plans to leave the state. But due to the federal government\u2019s actions to restrict access to transition care, she and her husband moved Libby, who is now 15, and their other two children out of the United States to a country Gonzales declined to disclose.",
      "\u201cLiving in Texas, we became targets of politicians who have boldly rejected the consensus of medical experts and decided that they know better than Libby, my husband and I, and our team of physicians and have opted to use us as their political targets, instead of allowing us the parental rights that they so claim to advocate for,\u201d Gonzales said during the press briefing held by the Human Rights Campaign.",
      "An estimated 724,000 youth ages 13 to 17 \u2014 about 3.3% of all American youth in that age group \u2014 identify as transgender, according to an analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from the Williams Institute at UCLA.",
      "An even smaller percentage of that group access transition care, according to research.",
      "A study published this year in JAMA Pediatrics found that less than 0.1% of adolescents ages 8 to 17 \u2014 or about 5,100 \u2014 with private insurance in the United States are transgender or gender diverse and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones. The study also found that no patients under 12 were prescribed hormones.",
      "A 2024 study published in JAMA Network Open found that the rate of teens ages 15 to 17 undergoing gender-affirming surgery was 2.1 per 100,000.",
      "Just a day before the HHS announcement, the House passed a bill that would charge doctors with a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison if they provide gender-affirming care for minors. The legislation, introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R.-Ga., is expected to die in the Senate but marks the harshest federal penalty for doctors providing transition-related care to minors ever passed by the House.",
      "Greene called the bill\u2019s passage \u201ca win for children all over America\u201d on X on Wednesday.",
      "Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R.-Texas, introduced another bill the House will vote on Thursday that would prohibit Medicaid from covering gender transition procedures for anyone under the age of 18."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s political base has offered little resistance to his escalating pressure campaign on Venezuela, even as he edges closer to the kind of military confrontation he has long criticized elsewhere.",
      "After he won last year, Trump declared in his victory speech that he was \u201cnot going to start a war, I\u2019m going to stop wars,\u201d praising the \u201cstrong\u201d U.S. military that, \"ideally, we don\u2019t have to use.\u201d And this year he denounced decades of U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, decrying \u201cWestern interventionists\u201d who had given other countries \u201clectures on how to live.\u201d",
      "That stance has been tested as his administration seized an oil tanker, with Trump suggesting the U.S. could carry out land operations aimed at removing Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s  Maduro. The administration\u2019s campaign has already resulted in more than 26 boat strikes, killing at least 98 people, including a \u201cdouble tap\u201d strike now under congressional scrutiny.",
      "On Tuesday, the president said he was ordering a \u201ctotal and complete blockade\u201d of sanctioned oil tankers to and from Venezuela, accusing its government of using oil revenue to finance illicit operations, such as \u201cdrug terrorism.\u201d",
      "The unfolding campaign has become a test of whether Trump\u2019s political coalition will tolerate the use of force so long as it stays targeted and does not produce American casualties, political analysts and administration allies said in interviews with NBC News.",
      "\u201cMAGA loves blowing up the boats,\u201d said Rachel Bovard, vice president of programs at the Conservative Partnership Institute. \u201cThey do not want a land war with Venezuela.\u201d",

      "Justin Logan, director of defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank based in Washington, said the absence of any substantial backlash reflects not ideological agreement with the policy itself, but the low political cost of the administration\u2019s actions so far.",
      "\u201cYou can run wild and crazy foreign policies when the costs are low, and the costs here have been low thus far,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you entered into a regime change conflict, the cost would go up, and the attention and dissent would go up.\u201d",
      "Asked by reporters this month how an invasion or land strikes in Venezuela  \u2014 which would raise the risk of a prolonged war and potentially involve U.S. troops \u2014 would align with the president\u2019s MAGA base, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Trump has been clear that he does not want a protracted war.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been very clear about that. He wants peace,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cHe also wants to see the end of illegal drugs being trafficked into the United States and taking the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans across our country, and he\u2019s thinking about that every day here at the White House, with every drug boat that is taken out by this administration.\u201d",
      "Reached for comment for this story, the White House framed the Venezuela actions as a fulfillment of the president\u2019s electoral promises on drug enforcement.",
      "\u201cOn the campaign trail, President Trump promised to take on the cartels \u2014 and he has taken unprecedented action to stop the scourge of narcoterrorism that has resulted in the needless deaths of innocent Americans,\u201d White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly said in a statement. \u201cAll of these decisive strikes have been against designated narcoterrorists bringing deadly poison to our shores, and the President will continue to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our country.\u201d",
      "Some Trump allies are wondering what Venezuela has to do with his administration\u2019s goals.",
      "\u201cThe question that I have is, who is asking for this?\u201d said one conservative foreign policy expert, who spoke candidly on the condition of anonymity. \u201cI don\u2019t feel a great upswell of MAGA nationalism, saying we have to dislodge Maduro, or saying stop the cocaine traffickers.\u201d",
      "Some critics of the administration\u2019s approach say there is at minimum a coherent historical argument for action, pointing to Trump\u2019s National Security Strategy for 2025, which promised to reassert the Monroe Doctrine \u201cafter years of neglect\" by asserting the U.S.\u2019s role in maintaining stability in the Western Hemisphere.",
      "\u201cWhile I\u2019m against the strikes on Venezuela, it\u2019s at least somewhat coherent that this is within our national interest,\u201d said Curt Mills, a conservative and policy analyst. \u201cThis is within our homeland. These people are bringing drugs. The Monroe Doctrine is at least rooted in some sort of history.\u201d",
      "Yet Mills, the executive director of The American Conservative magazine, said that if the administration were to try to remove Maduro, it could ignite a debate among conservatives that has not yet fully broken out into the open, one he said could eclipse disputes over Ukraine and Iran.",
      "\u201cThe argument against toppling dictators in Latin America is going to be one that is more divisive on the right than, say, caring about who controls the Donbas, or caring about the Iranians enriching to 2%,\u201d he said.",
      "There may be material public support for military actions aimed at preventing drugs from entering the country. During the last presidential campaign, NBC News polling found that among GOP policy proposals tested, using the military to stop illegal drugs from entering the U.S. from Mexico was the most popular, both among Republicans and voters overall.",
      "Logan said the administration\u2019s rhetoric on Venezuela has offered little in the way of telling what comes next, however.",
      "\u201cThe Western Hemisphere is where we build out from, it\u2019s the first order of business in our security,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what that means in practice is less clear. My sense is that people are all singing from the same hymn, but it\u2019s not clear what comes next.\u201d",
      "That ambiguity has allowed Trump to occupy both sides of the debate, maintaining a diplomatic opening even as he repeatedly threatens force.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying ... to project himself as tough to Maduro,\u201d said Patrick Hulme, an assistant professor of law and political science at the University of Florida. \u201cHe\u2019s bargaining with him. He\u2019s trying to make Maduro think that, \u2018I\u2019m Trump, I\u2019m crazy, I\u2019m a madman. I might actually do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "In a recent interview with Politico, Trump declined to discuss his military strategy but said that he wanted the Venezuelan people \u201cto be respected\u201d and that Maduro\u2019s \u201cdays are numbered.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Trump has spoken to Maduro in recent weeks. The conversation was described by a source familiar with the call as \u201cnot great, not terrible \u2014 decent,\u201d and Trump has appeared to leave open the door to further communication.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s weird,\u201d Mills said. \"Bush was not having conversations with Saddam. That is what\u2019s both stranger and more optimistic about this.\"",
      "Logan said there still appears to be some uncertainty about the policy\u2019s objectives, including at the highest level.",
      "\u201cAnd maybe even uncertainty in the mind of the president himself,\u201d he added. He pointed to Trump\u2019s comments after the tanker seizure, when he was asked what would happen to the oil.",
      "\u201c\u2018We\u2019ll keep it, I guess,\u2019\u201d Logan quoted the president as saying. \u201cWhich implies that this is not being drawn up with a great deal of specificity. There\u2019s an anti-Maduro policy. What end state that seeks and the costs that will be paid to pursue it, seem to me, undetermined.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt some point, the cup and the lip have to meet,\u201d said a political operative close to the administration.",
      "Even so, the rhetoric has grown sharper.",
      "In October, Trump said he had authorized the CIA to carry out covert lethal action in Venezuela, citing narcotics trafficking and repeating his claim that the country had emptied its prisons into the United States \u2014 an allegation Venezuela denies.",
      "Asked about the timing of possible land strikes, he said last week that they would happen \u201cpretty soon\" and suggested that similar actions could extend to other countries if drug targets were identified. He declined to say whether the U.S. would seize additional Venezuelan oil following the tanker seizure last week.",
      "The administration has said the tanker is used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. It also announced sanctions against six more ships and several members of Maduro\u2019s family.",
      "Democratic lawmakers and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., have expressed concern that the seizure, and in particular the \u201cdouble-tap\u201d strike in September on an alleged drug trafficking boat, could escalate tensions, raising questions about the president\u2019s war powers and the legal authority underpinning operations, especially the absence of explicit congressional authorization.",
      "Lawmakers in both parties have sought briefings and called for transparency around the strikes. Congress\u2019s annual defense authorization bill passed this week with a provision that would restrict the defense secretary\u2019s travel budget until he provides House and Senate committees with \u201cunedited video\u201d of the strikes.",
      "The question has become more than just political, analysts argue, as actions escalate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all wondering what one person will decide about the highest of high politics, the question of war and peace for the United States. And the Congress appears complacent and powerless,\u201d Logan said. \u201cTrump isn\u2019t even going through the motions of pretending the Congress has a role to play.\u201d",
      "Asked during a late October roundtable at the White House whether he would seek a declaration of war against drug cartels, which would need to be passed by Congress, Trump suggested he would not.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to necessarily ask for a declaration of war,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re just going to kill people that are bringing drugs into our country. OK, we\u2019re gonna kill them. You know, they\u2019re gonna be, like, dead.\u201d"

      "In her confessional, Savannah smiled wide as she celebrated her win and pointed out how she has been able to outlast her foes all season long.",
      "1st Tribal Council",
      "Back at camp, Kristina \u2014 who assumed Savannah, Soph and Rizo would vote together given that they've been a strong trio for most of the game \u2014 pitched voting out Sage to Soph and Rizo. During the reward meal, Sage suggested to Savannah that the better move was to vote out Kristina since she could beat anyone in the Fire-Making Challenge. Thus, the Tres Leches alliance was at a stalemate going into Tribal Council.",
      "After a back-and-forth between Kristina and Sage at Tribal Council where they both explained why the other was a threat, it was time to vote. Rizo \u2014 who had been holding onto his Hidden Immunity Idol for a record nine Tribal Councils \u2014 finally played his idol for himself before the votes were read.",
      "Probst read the votes and revealed Kristina as the 14th person voted out and seventh member of the jury.",
      "2nd Immunity Challenge",
      "Following an interruption due to an address from President Trump, the show picked up at the second and final Immunity Challenge of the night.",
      "The final four were neck and neck as they reached the final portion of the challenge. Soph pulled out a comeback victory and received her first Immunity Challenge win of the season.",
      "\"Oh my God, this is a dream!\" she said when Probst placed the necklace around her neck.",
      "Fire-Making Challenge",
      "As the winner, Soph had to choose which person to take to the end with her and which two castaways had to face off in the Fire-Making Challenge. She told the other three that they should practice while she contemplated her decision, adding that she didn't want them to plead their cases.",
      "In a confessional, Savannah said she felt betrayed by her \"best friend\" Soph for not instantly wanting to save her. Rizo tried to remain optimistic and said he had more experience making fire compared to Savannah and Sage. Sage also had a positive mentality as she prepared, telling herself that whatever was meant to happen would happen.",
      "At Tribal Council, Probst said Soph's choice could be a $1 million decision. She announced that she wanted to take Sage to the final three and have her two allies, Savannah and Rizo, make fire to earn the last spot.",
      "While Rizo struggled and repeatedly smothered his fire, Savannah nurtured a strong fire that continued to grow until it burned through the rope, making her the winner.",
      "Rizo became the eighth and final member of the jury. Before leaving, Rizo shared some emotional departing words. \"For a little Albanian boy from New York City... to say I have no regrets, to say I made my family proud, to say I made a whole country proud, I truly feel like I left an impact on this game.\"",
      "He asked to be called by his nickname, \"Riz God,\" as Probst snuffed his torch.",
      "Final Tribal Council",
      "As their final breakfast arrived at camp, Savannah, Sage and Soph reflected on being the first all-female final three in 20 seasons. They also shared some of their favorite moments with each member of the jury.",
      "Next, it was time for Final Tribal Council to begin. Rizo kicked things off by sharing kind words for the three ladies. The remaining members of the jury then posed questions that allowed each finalist to elaborate on their strategies and how they outwitted, outlasted and outplayed everyone else.",
      "When asked to name her most strategic move, Soph said she built strong connections outside of her trio that helped her social game. Savannah recalled a conversation with jury member Sophie Segreti where she pitched working together. Sage mentioned her move to vote out Sophie over Savannah.",
      "For their final pitches, Soph noted that she had been to 12 Tribal Councils and voted out more people than anyone else. Savannah said she successfully dodged the most bullets because she was adaptable, prioritized key relationships and dominated in Immunity Challenges. Sage said she had an important social component to her game that worked hand in hand with her strategic game, allowing her to build close friendships.",
      "And the Winner Is\u2026",
      "\"The jury has made their decision. I'll read the votes,\" Probst said. After three votes were revealed, each woman had a vote each. But as he continued to read the votes, Savannah's name appeared again and again. Savannah was crowned the winner of Season 49.",
      "The cast all toasted with champagne as Probst kicked off the after show.",
      "After Show and Final \u2018Survivor\u2019 Season 50 Contestants Revealed",
      "During the after show, Savannah said she felt \"imposter syndrome\" the whole season and it was a \"larger than life feeling\" to win the game. \"I don't even know what to say because I've never experienced anything like this before. It's a crazy feeling,\" she added.",
      "In the final moments of the episode, Probst introduced the first trailer for \"Survivor\" Season 50. At the start of the clip, the host is shown speaking to all the returning players. He tells them he expects them all to give \"everything\" they have to win.",
      "The chaotic trailer also mentioned that Zac Brown, Billie Eilish, Jimmy Fallon and MrBeast will impact the game in some way.",

    "story": [
      "A Santa Cruz teacher has gone viral after his simple request to have someone ask how his day went was answered by none other than Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.",
      "Jacob Myers, who has been teaching for two and a half years after working as an assistant teacher and substitute, started posting videos on Instagram in October about a day in the life of a high school teacher.",
      "He has shared fit checks and funny clips about his frustrating mornings, and also heartfelt videos about supporting his students and feeling stressed.",
      "But one of his recent videos caught the attention of over 100,000 social media users, including Kardashian. Myers shared a clip of him posing in his classroom. Text over the video included some facts about him, like his Italian roots and past life as a collegiate athlete. In the caption, he wrote, \u201cSomewhere out there is the woman who\u2019s gonna ask how my school day was.\u201d",
      "Kardashian decided to be the one to pose the pivotal question, writing \u201cHow was your day??\u201d in the comments. Her reply received over 80,000 likes and Instagram users immediately chimed in, suggesting that the two meet. Even Kardashian\u2019s close friend Malika Haqq encouraged the potential connection. \u201cIsn\u2019t she the sweetest,\u201d she asked the high school teacher and coach, playing wing woman for her bestie.",
      "Myers left a flirtatious reply: \u201cMine is great now. How was yours?\u201d Then he uploaded a follow-up video, also filmed in his classroom, giving Kardashian a longer response. He shared that he was interested in meeting up in person and pitched being her plus-one to a Kardashian Christmas party.",
      "He tagged Kardashian, Haqq and momager Kris Jenner in the post. \u201cThis is your sign to help a teacher out and tag @khloekardashian. Shooters gotta shoot,\u201d he playfully wrote in the caption.",
      "Myers tells TODAY.com that he decided to post the initial video on a whim when he was preparing for final exams and feeling swamped. He couldn\u2019t have imagined the amount of replies he received.",
      "\u201c(I) honestly never expected the attention. It\u2019s been very overwhelming and exciting at the same time, because I just post the videos for the fun of them,\u201d he shares. \u201cMy students are kind of my main priority. I\u2019m a teacher first and foremost.\u201d",
      "His students were the ones who encouraged him to start using his social media to post about his job.",
      "\u201cThey were like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you make Tiktok videos?\u2019\u201d he recalls them asking. They showed him other TikTokers who are teachers and he realized how many other educators can relate to his experience.",
      "He continues, \u201cI started to create content, and I ended up finding a community of teachers out there that were going through the same things. Just being stressed out as a teacher, but still enjoying it, and I was able to talk to them. Then it ended up creating a little support group in a way. Also, we\u2019re able to trade lesson plans and info. It\u2019s been a huge help to talk with teachers from around the world and connect with them.\u201d",
      "When he saw that Kardashian had noticed his content, he thought he might as well shoot his shot.",
      "\u201cYou never get that many opportunities in my world,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Why not? What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u2019\u201d",
      "After his interaction with the reality television star, his students, and co-workers, began teasing him that he was all over their For You Pages. He says during a school rally students gave gifts to all the teachers. They presented Myers with a Photoshopped picture of him and Kardashian.",
      "He doesn\u2019t mind the \"overwhelming\" attention or his students poking fun at him. But he says he hopes that his other videos resonate with people.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be known (as) the teacher that asked out Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. I\u2019d rather be known as a great teacher and a great coach, which I think I am,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s my passion.\u201d",
      "Myers, who has nearly 90,000 followers on Instagram now, adds, \u201cIt\u2019s been an exciting opportunity for me to actually shine a light on education and show people what I teach. There\u2019s a lot of other teachers out there that don\u2019t post and you don\u2019t actually see what they do. And there\u2019s a lot of other teachers that are just like me, who are teaching three different subjects and coaching multiple sports and running programs.\u201d",
      "He hopes his followers understand how much work educators put into helping their students.",
      "As for a future date with Kardashian? He hasn\u2019t heard anything yet.",
      "\u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s comment was incredibly kind, and of course I\u2019d love the opportunity to meet her,\u201d he says, adding that he is grateful for all the support he has received."

    "story": [
      "Wassail might be \u201call over the town\u201d this month, but what is it, exactly?",
      "Every holiday season, carolers sing about drinking eggnog by the fire like Medieval people did, or indulging in a holiday punch or Christmas goose like any of a number of Victorian families, all of which many modern folk still enjoy.",
      "However, some songs blaring over shopping mall speakers or the sound systems of holiday-themed bars make us wonder: What the heck is wassail? Why don\u2019t we still eat sugar plums and roasted chestnuts?",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, what is figgy pudding and why does Bing Crosby want it so badly?",
      "Figgy Pudding (\u2018We Wish You a Merry Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cNow, bring us some figgy pudding and bring it right here\u201d",
      "Merry modern revelers sing this song without knowing that \u201cfiggy pudding\u201d historically did not contain figs, as it was a misinterpretation of a British holiday classic \u2014 plum pudding \u2014 which is not a pudding in the American sense, but a dense, boiled dessert.",
      "The dish that became figgy pudding was originally more on the savory side, with preserved, sweetened meat and boiled vegetables, but eventually included prunes. Also, the word \u201cplum\u201d eventually became a label for all dried fruits, confusing the issue further.",
      "While stateside bakers don\u2019t traditionally prepare this complex treat for the holidays, save for brave souls like YouTubers Tyler Williams and Safiya Nygaard in 2022, it is still regularly sold in British stores.",
      "A version of figgy pudding being sold at luxury department store Harrods features sultanas, raisins, demerara sugar, pitted plums, figs \u2014 unlike its historical predecessor \u2014 and a butterscotch sauce, for $24.",
      "Sugar Plums (\u2018\u2019Twas the Night Before Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhile visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads\u201d",
      "Interestingly, the history of figgy pudding and sugar plums are related since they both use the word \u201cplum\u201d to refer to fruit or dessert.",
      "A sugar plum is a sugar-coated candy popular in Victorian times which often had a dried fruit like a cherry or fig or nut in the center. Not a plum at all, its name referred to its size and shape.",
      "In 2024, YouTuber Max Miller of Tasting History made sugar plums the traditional way and discovered how time-consuming it is to roll a nut in layer after layer of warm sugar until it becomes candy-coated.",
      "This might be why sugar plums live in the lyrics of this Christmas ditty and not actually in our modern tradition.",
      "Cup of Cheer (\u2018A Holly Jolly Christmas\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cHave a cup of cheer\u201d",
      "While a cup that makes you cheerful these days may be a strong cocktail made by Sam Heughan, the term doesn\u2019t only mean adult beverages in vintage Christmas lyricism. A \u201ccup of cheer\u201d can also refer to hot cocoa.",
      "Get The Recipe",
      "Wassail (\u2018Gloucestershire Wassail,\u2019 \u2018Here We Come A-Wassailing\u2019 and More)",
      "Lyric: \u201cWassail! Wassail all over the town!\u201d",
      "The term wassail has an olde English history: The hot mulled punch, which often consists of cider, wine or ale with winter spices, comes from the words \u201cwaes hael\u201d which means \u201cbe healthy.\u201d",
      "The term is also also a verb: Back in olden times, groups of revelers went door-to-door wassailing with a wassailing bowl, offering sips of drink from it for gifts at each home they visited. This tradition may seem familiar because it\u2019s actually where Christmas caroling comes from.",
      "Roasted Chestnuts (\u2018The Christmas Song\u2019)",
      "Lyric: \u201cChestnuts roasting on an open fire\u201d",
      "The opener to Nat King Cole\u2019s classic rendition of \u201cThe Christmas Song\u201d features a once-abundant treat enjoyed by early Americans during the holidays. In the 18th and 19th centuries, chestnuts were one of the most popular ingredients in early American food because of the preponderance of Chestnut trees speckling the East Coast at the time.",
      "For this Christmas tradition, a roasted chestnut has a soft texture and some say it tastes mild and sweet with a fluffy or potato-like texture \u2014 though one social media user who isn\u2019t a fan claims they have a \u201cmealy\u201d texture.",
      "Sadly, in 1904, a fungal disease tore through chestnut tree populations in the U.S., causing them to almost go extinct and fall out of favor as a traditional treat as a result, although countries like Turkey and Italy still feature the glossy brown nut during the holidays."

That brings the country\u2019s total stolen crypto to around $6.75 billion, the report said. The total amount of stolen crypto around the globe rose to $3.4 billion.",

      "Cryptocurrencies are stored in wallets, or accounts that can be accessed with passkeys, and it remains the case that if hackers gain control of an account, they can quickly wire it to a different wallet that they own. Unlike with traditional finance, there are few ways to reverse a fraudulent transaction.",

It is unclear if that specific submarine was damaged in the attack; moreover, three additional Kilo submarines are also observed in the port. A series of floating barriers remain positioned at the entrance to the naval base,\" Vantor said."

      "After meetings with Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff, son-in-law Jared Kushner and European leaders in Berlin, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told reporters Monday that Kyiv had now been offered an equivalent of NATO\u2019s Article 5 deterrence mechanism, under which an attack on one member is considered an attack on them all.",
      "This guarantee would be legally binding, he said, voted on and approved by the U.S. Congress.",
      "Zelenskyy said the latest draft was not \"perfect\" but was \"very workable.\" He abandoned Ukraine's long-held ambition of joining NATO over the weekend, ahead of the talks.",
      "These guarantees are \"the biggest win so far for Ukraine and for Europe,\" a U.S. official told reporters, warning that they \u201cwill not be on the table forever.\u201d The official added that they believe Russia will accept it in a final deal.",
      "Zelenskyy has maintained that any deal would need to provide concrete security guarantees to prevent future attacks by Russia. It\u2019s a historically sensitive issue for Kyiv since Moscow annexed the Crimean Peninsula in 2014 in violation of the Budapest Memorandum, meant to guarantee Ukraine's post-Soviet sovereignty in exchange for giving up its nuclear weapons.",
      "European leaders suggested their countries could lead a \u201cmultinational force\u201d supported by the U.S. that would \u201cassist in the regeneration of Ukraine\u2019s forces, in securing Ukraine\u2019s skies, and in supporting safer seas,\u201d alongside a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring, verification and deconfliction mechanism.",

      "The multinational force is \u201ca clear red line for Putin,\u201d said John Lough, head of foreign policy at the New Eurasian Strategies Centre, a London/Washington-based think tank focused on Russia. The Kremlin will also reject the idea of a U.S.-led ceasefire monitoring and verification mechanism, he said, and will likely ask for restrictions on the kinds of weapons systems available to Kyiv\u2019s forces.",

      "\u201cSo this is likely to go a few more rounds,\u201d Lough said.",

      "He wants Ukraine to give up its entire Donbas region, even though Kyiv's forces still control a part of it and it is something Zelenskyy has said he will never do.",
      "\u201cThe Americans are trying to find a compromise,\u201d Zelenskyy said Monday. \u201cThey are proposing a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 (in the Donbas). And I want to stress once again: a \u2018free economic zone\u2019 does not mean under the control of the Russian Federation.\u201d",
      "Trump has insisted that Ukraine would have to cede territory, but it's unclear how this compromise would work or whether the Kremlin would give it the time of day.",
      "A U.S. official said they had given Zelenskyy some \"thought-provoking ideas,\" and that they would speak with Russia and Europe about them after his response. Zelenskyy said the U.S. would take the new draft to Russia in the coming days.",
      "Asked if any of the security guarantees floated Monday were unacceptable to the Kremlin, spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had yet to see any updated agreements. He reiterated that Russia wants a comprehensive peace deal, not a short-term ceasefire over Christmas as Kyiv has suggested.",
      "\u201cWe want peace. We don\u2019t want a truce to give Ukraine a breathing space and prepare for a continuation of the war,\u201d Peskov told reporters.",
      "But while the Kremlin is likely to stonewall the newest agreements, Tuck said, the proposed security guarantees put pressure on Russia by implying a growing consensus between Ukraine and the West on what a peace agreement should look like.",
      "\u201cThe agreement isn\u2019t nothing, we aren\u2019t back to square one: the statement does indicate a more united front by the West, and getting the U.S. to commit, even in general and early terms, to providing some form of security guarantees is a significant development,\u201d Tuck said."

      "Toh said Lai had \u201cnever wavered in his intention to destabilize\u201d the Chinese government, citing his WhatsApp messages, live chats, Fox News interviews and social media posts. She said he continued to pursue his goals even after the national security law was enacted on June 30, 2020, but \u201cin a less explicit way.\u201d",
      "Lai\u2019s \u201conly intent\u201d was to \u201cseek the downfall\u201d of the Chinese Communist Party, Toh said, \u201ceven though the ultimate cost was the sacrifice of the interests of the people\u201d of China and Hong Kong.",

      "John Lee, Hong Kong\u2019s top leader, welcomed the conviction, saying it \u201cdemonstrates the justice of the law and upholds Hong Kong\u2019s core values.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai has long used his media outlet, Apple Daily, to wantonly create social conflicts, incite social antagonism, incite hatred, glorify violence and openly beg for foreign sanctions,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "\u201cThe law will never allow anyone, regardless of profession or background, to openly harm their own country and compatriots under the guise of human rights, democracy and freedom,\u201d he added.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the verdict. A White House official confirmed to NBC News last month that Trump discussed Lai\u2019s case with Chinese President Xi Jinping during their meeting in South Korea in October.",
      "Lai\u2019s son Sebastien Lai said after the verdict that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by his father\u2019s health condition and that \u201cthe U.K. government has to do more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to put action behind words and make my father\u2019s release a precondition to closer relationships with China,\u201d he told reporters in London.",
      "'We can bear witness'",
      "Lai\u2019s trial is seen as a test of judicial independence and press freedom in Hong Kong, which was promised its Western-style civil liberties would be preserved for 50 years upon its return to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "Members of the public lined up overnight to secure tickets to Monday morning\u2019s hearing, with police monitoring the area.",
      "A Hong Kong resident surnamed Chan, who declined to be identified by her full name for fear of retribution, said Lai was the \u201cmost recognizable\u201d face involved in the city\u2019s social movements.",
      "Chan, 27, said outside the court building that she felt a sense of \u201cabsurdity and anger\u201d about the verdict.",
      "\u201cAn individual can\u2019t change much, but we can bear witness,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is the least we can do in a limited space.\u201d",
      "Rights groups criticized the conviction, with Human Rights Watch saying it was \u201cboth cruel and a travesty of justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government\u2019s mistreatment of Jimmy Lai aims to silence everyone who dares to criticize the Communist Party,\u201d Asia director Elaine Pearson said in a statement.",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said the ruling \u201cunderscores Hong Kong\u2019s utter contempt for press freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cJimmy Lai\u2019s only crime is running a newspaper and defending democracy,\u201d Beh Lih Yi, the group\u2019s Asia-Pacific director, said in a statement. \u201cThe risk of him dying from ill health in prison increases as each day passes \u2014 he must be reunited with his family immediately.\u201d",
      "The Hong Kong and Chinese governments say Lai has received a fair trial and that the criticism is an attempt to undermine the city\u2019s rule of law. They say press freedom continues to be protected under Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that Beijing \u201cexpresses strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the public slanders and smears against Hong Kong\u2019s judiciary by certain countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is entirely reasonable, fair and lawful\u201d for Hong Kong\u2019s judicial organs \u201cto perform their duties, uphold the authority of the law and safeguard national security,\u201d said the spokesperson, Guo Jiakun.",
      "Lai has spent nearly five years in solitary confinement since his arrest in 2020, during which time he has been convicted on multiple other charges, including unauthorized assembly and fraud. His family and supporters have expressed growing concern about his health, as Lai suffers from diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as heart palpitations.",
      "The Hong Kong government says Lai has received \u201cadequate and comprehensive\u201d medical services in custody and that it separates people such as Lai from other prisoners at their own request to ensure their \u201cpersonal safety and well-being.\u201d",
      "Though the Lai trial is Hong Kong\u2019s highest-profile case stemming from the crackdown, it has \u201cmuch less significant\u201d implications for the city\u2019s press freedom and autonomy than two other cases from last year, said John Burns, an emeritus professor specializing in Chinese politics at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "Those cases are the convictions of two journalists accused of sedition over their work for the now-defunct pro-democracy newspaper Stand News and the subversion charges against 47 pro-democracy figures over their involvement in an unofficial primary election, 45 of whom were convicted or pleaded guilty.",
      "Open dissent has been chilled in Hong Kong under the Beijing-imposed national security law and related local legislation, both of which officials say were necessary to restore stability after the 2019 protests. Most of the city\u2019s pro-democracy figures have been imprisoned, quit politics or moved overseas.",
      "The verdict in Lai\u2019s case comes a day after Hong Kong\u2019s last major opposition party, the Democratic Party, disbanded after a vote by its members, who cited pressure from Chinese officials or intermediaries.",
      "It also comes a week after near-record-low turnout in a \u201cpatriots only\u201d legislative election held under rules that were changed in 2021 to require national security vetting of candidates. Officials have defended the new rules as necessary to restore stability, but critics say they have sidelined groups such as the Democratic Party and left the legislature without any meaningful opposition.",
      "Tensions were already running high in Hong Kong amid public grief over a fire at a high-rise housing complex last month that killed at least 160 people in the city\u2019s worst blaze in almost 80 years. Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have vowed to punish any \u201canti-China\u201d forces that try to use the tragedy to \u201crecreate the chaos\u201d of 2019."
