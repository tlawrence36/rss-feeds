      "Lucinda Williams isn\u2019t easily intimidated, but it would be hard for any musician not to shudder at the task before her",
      "Lucinda Williams isn't easily intimidated, but it would be hard for any musician not to shudder at the task before her.",
      "The mission? Record an album of Beatles songs \u2014 only one of the best-known catalogs in popular music \u2014 in the same London studio where most of the originals were made. She and her band had just three days.",
      "The result, \u201cLucinda Williams sings the Beatles from Abbey Road,\u201d becomes public on Friday. It's the seventh in her series of \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects and the first one that will be made available on streaming services.",
      "The Nashville-based singer-songwriter delivers her take on 12 Beatles songs, most of them from the band's later period. She takes on hits like the Paul McCartney ballads \u201cLet it Be\u201d and \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\" while also choosing the more obscure \u201cWhite Album\u201d cuts \u201cYer Blues\u201d and \u201cI'm So Tired.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt felt like the Holy Grail,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where the Beatles recorded. And we're going to go in there where they made all of these majestic, classic, amazing songs?\u201d",
      "Abbey Road was the idea of her manager-husband, Tom Overby, and they blocked out a small amount of time before a British tour earlier this year. Her Beatles fan producer, Ray Kennedy, said he believed Williams was the first major artist to use the London studio to remake the band's work.",
      "And, yes, it was intimidating. Fortunately, it was a modern, working studio and did not feel like working in a museum. One quirk was the control room was on a different floor than where the musicians were, and Williams repeatedly climbed the stairs to hear playbacks. \u201cThe engineers all looked at me, like, \u2018what are you doing here,'\u201d she said.",
      "Stripping down songs for the band to build up again revealed complexities they hadn't anticipated. She particularly enjoyed John Lennon's \u201cYer Blues.\u201d \u201cThe depth and the edginess and the grittiness of it kind of surprised me,\" she said.",
      "They stuck to the basics of her rock band's sound. The orchestral flourishes of \u201cThe Long and Winding Road,\u201d for example, are replaced by an organ and pedal-steel guitar.",
      "\u201cMy greatest fear was, I didn't want to sound like a cover band doing Beatles songs,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd everyone I've talked to about it said you don't have to worry about that, that you achieved your goal of staying true to the songs while still sounding like you.\u201d",
      "During the pandemic, Williams made six \u201cLu's Jukebox\u201d projects, themed in-studio concerts. They included Tom Petty and Bob Dylan songs, albums of Southern soul, '60s country classics and holiday music. She made a disc of Rolling Stones material only days before having a stroke in November 2020.",
      "Sold largely by mail order, they haven't been available to stream, although a spokesperson said they're likely to be made available in that format in the future."

      "The long-running gang and racketeering trial in Atlanta that led rapper Young Thug to plead guilty in October has ended with a jury finding the last two defendants not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges",
      "ATLANTA -- The long-running gang and racketeering trial that led Atlanta rapper Young Thug to plead guilty in October ended on Tuesday with the last two defendants found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges.",
      "Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges and Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.",
      "The original, sweeping indictment used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence and charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in a 2015 drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop that killed Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d who prosecutors said was in a rival gang. Stillwell also was charged with fatally shooting Shymel Drinks at a red light in 2022, allegedly in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which prosecutors said was co-founded by Young Thug.",
      "Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began, and four more pleaded guilty during the trial, in October. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. That left Kendrick and Stillwell, both of whom were stabbed while in jail \u2014 Stillwell last year and Kendrick on Sunday.",
      "Tuesday's verdicts were a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWe always respect the verdict of a jury,\u201d said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Willis.",
      "Defense attorneys said the state relied on faulty evidence \u2014 song lyrics, cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony \u2014 to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "The jury's decision left Kendrick\u2019s mom, Tasha Kendrick, in tears.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for a lot of things right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emotions are all over the place right now.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Williams and two others founded Young Slime Life in association with the national Bloods gang in 2012. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Deamonte Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d as well as Young Thug\u2019s \u201cSlime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence.",
      "Williams entered a risky \u201cblind\u201d plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Williams\u2019 lawyer said he felt like they were winning, but the rapper complained that sitting in court felt like \u201chell\u201d and wanted to go home to his family. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial shook Atlanta\u2019s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after he met with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. Kendrick\u2019s attorney Doug Weinstein said defendants got a \u201cfair trial\u201d once Whitaker took over. Among other things, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.",
      "During closings, Stillwell\u2019s defense attorney Max Schardt sought to cast doubts on the gang investigators and other state witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison. Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn\u2019t say the right thing.",
      "Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had \u201csnitched\u201d on. They said their statements were corroborated by other evidence such as songs and social media posts where they said defendants were \u201cbragging about murder.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors threw together lyrics, social media posts and irrelevant evidence to \u201csee what sticks,\u201d Weinstein argued, but did not prove they were connected to a criminal enterprise.",
      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, Schardt said during closings, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",
      "Both defense attorneys said Kendrick and Stillwell have other pending charges but hope to get them released from jail as soon as possible.",
      "Stillwell is not \u201cblind to the fact that he is getting a second chance at life,\" Schardt said.",
      "Weinstein said Kendrick, who is close friends with Young Thug, was laser-focused on his music career before the state pulled him back into the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so happy that he can kind of draw a line in the sand now,\u201d Weinstein said. \u201cAll of this is behind him. He can get on with his life and not worry about this nonsense.\u201d",

      "Forty years ago, on Dec. 8, 1984, one of the largest manhunts in FBI history came to an explosive end on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound",
      "Forty years ago, on Dec. 8, 1984, one of the largest manhunts in FBI history came to an explosive end on Whidbey Island in Puget Sound. The person they were after was Robert Jay Mathews, the leader of a white supremacist group committing armed robberies to finance plans to overthrow the government. The standoff lasted more than 30 hours.",
      "It\u2019s a dramatic episode in history that\u2019s chronicled in the new film \u201cThe Order,\u201d in theaters Friday, a 1970s-styled thriller starring Jude Law as an FBI agent who connects the dots of the violent crimes arising in the Pacific Northwest and Nicholas Hoult as the enigmatic Mathews. The group, responsible for the murder of Jewish radio talk show host Alan Berg, and that infamous showdown, also continues to resonate with some on the far right, who make pilgrimages to Whidbey Island this time of year for \u201cMartyr\u2019s Day.\u201d",
      "Neither the English stars nor the Australian director Justin Kurzel were familiar with the history of the group when they first read Zach Baylin\u2019s script, based on Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cThe Silent Brotherhood.\u201d But it felt full of potential for an entertaining, complex movie, with car chases, bank heists, shootouts and pathos.",
      "\u201cIt just reminded me of the great old heist films from the '70s, with a Sidney Lumet, William Friedkin kind of feel about it,\u201d Kurzel said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s a period film, it\u2019s so incredibly present and sort of dangerously still relevant.\u201d",
      "That relevance would soon become even clearer. Three months after Kurzel got the script, he watched the Capitol riot unfold on Jan. 6, 2020, and spotted someone holding a copy of \u201cThe Turner Diaries,\u201d one of Mathews' major inspirations. And yet it would be an uphill battle to get the film both made and into theaters, now a semi-miracle for an independent production.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a battle to get this kind of film made. You really need to find champions for it,\u201d said Law, who also signed on to produce with his company Riff Raff. \u201cThe historical story is all wrapped up in this film in a genre. It\u2019s got a very crowd-pleasing energy to it. It\u2019s edge of your seat, cat and mouse. It harkens back to those incredibly successful films in the \u201870s and \u201980s that people would go to and be seen as kind of blockbusters \u2026 it\u2019s funny that those films don\u2019t always necessarily get the budget they should nowadays.\u201d",
      "One of Law\u2019s favorite qualities of the script was that it was written with neither empathy for nor judgement of Mathews or his followers. But that\u2019s not to say that bringing him to life was straightforward. For Hoult, it was a daunting task.",
      "\u201cTo play a character like that, you have to try and understand them as best as possible,\u201d Hoult said. \u201cTo do that, you have to figure out their way of living and also what made them the way they are. That means taking in a lot of the information that they would have taken in that shaped their ideology and beliefs, which is a horrible place to go to because it\u2019s not stuff that you necessarily want filling your every day and to have those thoughts flowing through your head.\u201d",
      "But Hoult felt safe with Kurzel, a director he\u2019d worked with on \u201cThe True History of the Kelly Gang.\u201d He was also looking forward to collaborating with Law, though they weren\u2019t exactly hanging out during the shoot. Kurzel asked Law and Hoult to stay away from one another until their characters meet in the film to add a dynamism to that scene.",
      "\u201cIt was an adrenaline that you can\u2019t fake,\u201d Hoult said.",
      "Unbeknownst to Hoult, Kurzel also told Law to follow him around one day in Calgary \u2014 a tactile assignment that he knows sounds a little crazy but that sometimes unlocks real things for actors.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t hugely eventful,\u201d Law laughed, but he saw its benefits. \u201cJustin writes up for his actors manifestos and sets them tasks. He\u2019s not precious about it. He says, do it or don\u2019t do it. I think we both found them really interesting and really helpful ways in to just kind of embodying these people that you\u2019ve got to become.\u201d",
      "As with all independently made films, they didn\u2019t always have the time or money they would have liked, but they made it work.",
      "\u201cEach bank heist or armored truck robbery was basically done in a day,\u201d Hoult said. \u201cThe speed you\u2019re going and the frantic energy of that is helpful for creating what ends up on the screen, the chaos of that.\u201d",
      "And up until the last minute, they were even contemplating rewriting the famous final showdown. There was a total fire ban in Alberta because of wildfires, but it lifted just in time.",
      "\u201cWe were very lucky,\u201d Kurzel said of the showstopper moment.",
      "The film premiered earlier this year at the Venice Film Festival and has since played at several others, which has allowed everyone the rare privilege of seeing many responses to what they\u2019ve made. And it's been overwhelmingly positive.",
      "\u201cThis has happened before, that you make something you believe in, you love it and it just disappears or no one gets it. And you realize so much of it has to do with timing and impact,\u201d Law said. \u201cBut it feels like people really appreciate what we\u2019ve tried to do, and they really get it.\u201d"

      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history \u2014 one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16.",
      "Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life \u2014 formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep.",
      "The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult.",
      "Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and \u2014 especially for those in vulnerable groups \u2014 isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do?",
      "This is, after all, the 21st century \u2014 an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away?",
      "Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences?",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media.",
      "Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia\u2019s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners \u2014 and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits.",
      "Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there\u2019s ample reason to ensure that children wait.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,\" said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.\u201d",
      "The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook\u2019s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially when they are tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies \u2014 though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship.",
      "What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral.",
      "Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects \u2014 often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate?",
      "Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban \u201cone of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today\" even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States",
      "\"These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,\u201d Taske said.",
      "\u201cNot only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they\u2019re passionate about, but they\u2019re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,\" he said. \"Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families \u2014 not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.\u201d",
      "David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill \u201cabout as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike\u201d in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require \u201chard verification\u201d such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective \u201cage-assurance\u201d that includes an array of ways companies can estimate someone's age. He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process.",
      "Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications \u2014 and something that can protect teens on social platforms.",
      "\u201cWhether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,\u201d Inserra said. \u201cBut if every user of online platforms must first identify themselves, then their anonymity is at risk.\u201d",
      "Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones.",
      "This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools \u2014 a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful.",
      "U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings \u2014 most recently in January \u2014 on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House.",
      "While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children\u2019s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states.",
      "And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to address the harms of social media the same way they regulate things like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use.",
      "Said Scelfo: \u201cWhy should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions \u2014 just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs \u2014 but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products. And so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.\u201d",

      "Here\u2019s what to know about the history of Enron and the purported effort to bring it back.",
      "Once the nation\u2019s seventh-largest company, Enron filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001, after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt or make failing ventures appear profitable. The energy company's collapse put more than 5,000 people out of work and wiped out more than $2 billion in employee pensions. Its aftershocks were felt throughout the energy sector.",
      "Twenty-four Enron executives, including former CEO Jeffrey Skilling, were convicted for their roles in the fraud. Enron founder Ken Lay\u2019s convictions were vacated after he died of heart disease following his 2006 trial.",

      "\u201cIf it\u2019s a joke, it\u2019s rude, extremely rude. And I hope that they realize it and apologize to all of the Enron employees,\u201d Peters said.",

    "story": [
      "An Irish YouTuber hopes to raise millions of dollars for charity this holiday season \u2014 and is using a popular gaming technology to rally his fans around the cause",
      "NEW YORK -- Se\u00e1n McLoughlin wears a lot of hats: YouTuber. Voice actor. Coffee entrepreneur. But McLoughlin, better known by his pseudonym Jacksepticeye, likes to say he would be a therapist if he wasn't posting video game playthroughs for his nearly 31 million subscribers.",
      "The 34-year-old Irish creator finds that gaming enthusiasts aren't just drawn by his expressive reactions to the latest action role-playing games; fans also resonate with his candid discussions of mental health. The supportive responses from his niche but passionate following make McLoughlin feel \u201cless alone,\u201d he said, forging the same camaraderie that brought him to online gaming communities as a lonely 20-something living at his family\u2019s remote home.",
      "That shared connection is also central to his annual fundraiser, \u201cThankmas.\" The charity livestream is one of many online specials emerging as a modern spin on the classic telethon. Total donations have increased more than 50% over the last year on Tiltify, a digital platform that integrates giving tools into streams. The spaces are credited for allowing more authentic interactions between nonprofits and young donors \u2014 and encouraging benevolence in a corner of the web marked by incendiary rhetoric.",
      "\u201cIf you want to do good things, the people are there, and they\u2019ll listen,\u201d McLoughlin said. \u201cThey\u2019re already following you for what you do for a reason. So they\u2019ll follow you to help out people as well.\u201d",
      "Follow they have. His streams have raked in more than $26 million, according to partner Tiltify. This year's goal is to collect $6 million for two nonprofits supporting mental health: Crisis Text Line and Samaritans.",
      "A seven-figure target would have seemed a longshot when McLoughlin entered the space. The initial idea was to hold monthly fundraisers. He hosted seven charitable streams in 2018, Tiltify records show, for causes including pediatric cancer and clean water. The year culminated in the inaugural \"Thankmas,\" which pulled over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "But McLoughlin said the pace became \u201ca bit much.\u201d That same year he announced a brief break from YouTube, in part due to unhappiness from the demands he felt for high content volumes. He resolved to focus on one big holiday event at the end of the year, when he said people are \u201ca bit more giving and heartfelt.\u201d",
      "It wasn't until 2020 that Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman said the two began working closely to maximize the streams' reach. McLoughlin reached out, according to Wasserman, and said he wanted something \u201cmore impactful.\u201d With communities worldwide reeling from the pandemic, they put together the #HopeFromHome campaign: a peer-to-peer event where multitudes could simultaneously rally around the same cause. McLoughlin served as a tent pole supporting the other streamers.",
      "Their first effort together yielded $1.9 million for United Way Worldwide and more than one-third came from McLoughlin\u2019s stream alone. The following \u201cThankmas\u201d generated more than $4.7 million. Wasserman said he\u2019d never seen his technology used so collaboratively.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what really made this a regular, multimillion-dollar event,\" Wasserman said. \u201cNot just making it, \u2018Hey I\u2019m going to fundraise and just watch me,' but, \u2018We as a community can do this and get involved together.'\u201d",
      "This year's \u201cThankmas\u201d will be performed before a live audience in Los Angeles but broadcast online. Recent specials have seen McLoughlin make surprise calls into streams that are also pooling contributions. Comedic segments sometimes feature traditional celebrities; actor Jack Black played a life-sized game of Jenga in 2022.",
      "The idea resembles the star-studded telethon pioneered last century by comedian Jerry Lewis. But new technologies and web cultures enable more engaging experiences. Wasserman said charitable livestreams like McLoughlin's are not a \u201cpassive watching experience.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca much more personable approach to giving,\u201d according to Yvette Wohn, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies human-computer interaction.",
      "A streamer\u2019s audience \u201ccares about them,\u201d Wohn said, and donors flock to their content because \u201cthey really like that person.\u201d Social media and chat boxes allow fans to feel seen by hosts in ways television viewers could never expect. Followers might get shoutouts by name upon contributing. McLoughlin has previously shared fan art submitted through specific hashtags.",
      "Fandoms also develop subcultures. McLoughlin\u2019s gaming catchphrases are especially popular among his circles. Jacksepticeye content often starts with him shouting, \u201cTop of the morning to ya, laddies!\u201d and fans have uploaded video compilations of the expression. Members then form friendships with others in the fandom. That creates a \u201cpositive social pressure\u201d to donate, according to Wohn, helping new generations \u201cdip their toes into building an identity as somebody that gives.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiving habits are things that build over time,\u201d Wohn said. \u201cIf younger people start to engage in this culture of giving, I feel like the general culture of giving might expand in ways that cannot be done from a top-down perspective.\u201d",
      "Still, McLoughlin describes online communities as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d The \u201cmonetization of hate,\u201d he said, is \u201cbigger than it's ever been.\u201d And the desire for acceptance can introduce lonely people to dark pockets of the internet that nevertheless provide kinship.",
      "\u201cThankmas\u201d aims to prove it's easy to do good online. Yes, he acknowledged, charity work is \u201cquite intimidating.\" Where is the line between promoting the fundraiser and promoting himself? McLoughlin doesn't know. He just hopes people trust it's coming from the right place.",
      "At least one longtime follower was drawn by McLoughlin's ties to this year's cause. Jack Worthey, a 20-year-old from Texas, said McLoughlin brought much comfort growing up with \u201csimilar family troubles.\" It had been several years since he watched Jacksepticeye content, he said, but he was pulled back by an October video where McLoughlin detailed his journey finding mental health treatment.",
      "Worthey said he wouldn't have looked into \"Thankmas\" had McLoughlin had not made the promotion so personal. He now plans to raise awareness through digital art. For Worthey, returning to the channel as an adult and seeing the \u201cpositive product\u201d has been \u201creally amazing.\"",
      "\u201cIt makes you see what I was enjoying when I was younger in a different light,\u201d Worthey said. \"It brings a different type of joy.\u201d",

      "The Princess of Wales helped kick off the emir of Qatar\u2019s trip to Britain as the U.K. government enlists one of the most popular royals to ensure the success of a state visit by the leader of a key ally",
      "LONDON -- The Princess of Wales helped kick off the emir of Qatar\u2019s trip to Britain on Tuesday as the U.K. government enlists one of the most popular royals to ensure the success of a state visit by the leader of a key ally, even as the princess recovers from cancer treatment.",
      "The event will be just one of a handful of appearances that Prince William\u2019s wife, better known as Kate, has made since she was diagnosed with cancer in March, underscoring the importance of the gas-rich gulf state that invests billions in Britain and has played a central role in ceasefire talks between Israel and Hamas.",
      "William and Kate greeted Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani in the morning. The couples then traveled to Horse Guards Parade in central London, where King Charles III formally welcomed the emir and Sheikha Jawaher to Britain at the start of a two-day visit that will include a trip to Westminster Abbey, a banquet at Buckingham Palace and a meeting with Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Queen Camilla, who pulled out of Tuesday's chilly outdoor events on medical advice, told guests at a palace lunch that she had suffered from a lingering chest infection that was a form of pneumonia, Britain's Press Association reported. She added that she no longer has pneumonia, but was suffering from post-viral fatigue.",
      "Though smaller than the U.S. state of Connecticut, Qatar has the world\u2019s third-largest reserves of natural gas and is a key investor in the U.K. The Qatari Investment Authority owns the luxury retailer Harrod\u2019s and holds large stakes in British companies such as Barclays Bank and the supermarket chain Sainsbury\u2019s. It has also invested heavily in London real estate, including the Shard, western Europe\u2019s tallest building.",
      "But the display of pomp being rolled out for the emir sits uneasily with human rights advocates who say women and LGBTQ+ people face discrimination in Qatar, and migrant workers still haven\u2019t been compensated for \u201cegregious abuses\u201d that occurred during preparations for the 2022 soccer World Cup.",
      "\u201cHosting the royal visit without addressing these issues is tantamount to royal-washing Qatar\u2019s troubling rights record,\u201d said Yasmine Ahmed, U.K. director of Human Rights Watch.",
      "The state visit comes at the end of a difficult year for Britain\u2019s royal family.",
      "The king was sidelined for two months after it was announced in February that he had been diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer. Just a few weeks later, Kate made public her own cancer diagnosis and said that she, too, would be stepping away from public duties to focus on her treatment and recovery.",
      "While Charles returned to public duties at the end of April, Kate needed more time and her return has been slower.",
      "The princess has made only a few public appearances this year, mostly at moments of national significance. They included the king\u2019s annual birthday parade in June and the men\u2019s final at Wimbledon in July. Most recently, she took part in the annual Remembrance Day ceremonies in November to honor the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The princess announced in September that she had completed chemotherapy treatment.",
      "One reason the government and royal family may have asked Kate and William to play a major role in the Qatari state visit is because they have a lot in common with the emir.",
      "All three are in their early 40s and were educated at elite British prep schools. The emir and William are both graduates of the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, with the emir going on to serve in the Qatari military and William serving in both the British Army and Royal Air Force.",
      "Kate and William will join the Qatari royals and the king and queen for a carriage procession to Buckingham Palace.",
      "After lunch at the palace, the emir and Sheikha Jawaher will visit Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament.",
      "Later in the day, the king and queen will host a state banquet at Buckingham Palace.",
      "On Wednesday, the emir will visit Sandhurst, meeting with some of his former classmates and current Qatari cadets. He will also meet with RAF personnel who are providing advanced training for Qatari air force pilots.",
      "The emir will then travel to the prime minister\u2019s residence at 10 Downing Street for his meeting with Starmer.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 10:42:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Robin Cook, the king of medical thrillers, returns with &ldquo;Bellevue.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "Robin Cook, the king of medical thrillers, returns with \u201cBellevue.\u201d",
      "The building on New York\u2019s East Side that used to house Bellevue Psychiatric Hospital has inspired tales of horror from the likes of H.P. Lovecraft and served as the model for Arkham Asylum in fictional Gotham City. For novelist Robin Cook, who interned there in the 1960s, it\u2019s the perfect setting for his latest medical thriller.",
      "\u201cBellevue\u201d is set in the present day, but hearkens often to the hospital\u2019s controversial and storied past. The plot centers around 23-year-old Mitt Fuller, embarking on his surgical residency at the iconic hospital. Mitt\u2019s \u201clong and impressive medical pedigree\u201d goes back more than 400 years and includes three previous surgeons and a psychiatrist. It\u2019s always been Mitt\u2019s dream to follow in his forefathers\u2019 footsteps.",
      "But this is a Robin Cook novel, so readers shouldn\u2019t be surprised that Mitt\u2019s dream slowly becomes a nightmare. Cook does a nice job of drawing readers into the tale, not horrifying them all at once. Mitt possesses a little precognitive power and can sometimes see things before they happen or sense when he\u2019s in danger. So when forceps start moving of their own accord during a procedure or sutures untie themselves, readers and Mitt get a serious case of the heebie-jeebies.",
      "Readers learn early in the story why the hospital is haunted, but dramatic irony is at play for more than a hundred pages as Mitt assembles the puzzle and unearths his family\u2019s buried secrets. Mitt\u2019s medical training and belief in science don\u2019t exactly square with a haunted hospital, but when he meets another hospital employee whose family has a history at the institution, together they put together the rest of the pieces.",
      "The denouement is jarring, but feels earned. Cook has told a tale that delivers a measure of justice for some patients, while preserving the dreadful mystique spelled out on top of the \u201cdecorative rusty wrought iron fence\u201d at the southeastern corner of First Avenue and 30th Street: B-E-L-L-E-V-U-E.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:58:31 -0500",
    "summary": "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
    "story": [
      "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment.",
      "Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent.",
      "Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city\u2019s picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was.",
      "For years, \u201cwe saw the OFF signs, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. \u201cOnly the artists knew among themselves what was going on.\u201d",
      "Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country\u2019s culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets.",
      "But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status.",
      "So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second.",
      "It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said.",
      "Designers Kemi Bass\u00e8ne and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans \u2014 a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer \u2014 to interpret the theme of \u201chippo.\u201d",
      "They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water.",
      "The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag.",
      "Papise Kant\u00e9, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell.",
      "\u201cI have been sculpting since I was a young child,\" said Kant\u00e9, who comes from a long line of sculptors. \u201cEvery artist wants to get better.\u201d",
      "But it also gave his work recognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Biennale that people know my work,\" he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, \u201cyou are proud.\"",
      "Bass\u00e8ne, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,\u201d Bass\u00e8ne said. \u201cFor craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cnormal,\u201d he said, to include artisans in the Biennale \u201cif we wanted to try to decolonize a little.\u201d",
      "This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course.",
      "Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese \u2014 including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources.",
      "The theme of this year's Biennale has been \u201cThe Wake,\u201d alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers.",
      "The new government of Senegal has \u201ca transformational agenda,\u201d said Bass\u00e8ne. \u201cI think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.\"",
      "In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students.",
      "His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents \u201cdo not have to buy Chinese products.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have all the know-how,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can produce more.\u201d",

      "Debbie Nelson, the single mother of rapper Eminem whose rocky relationship with her son was known widely through his hit song lyrics, has died. She was 69.",
      "Eminem\u2019s longtime representative Dennis Dennehy confirmed Nelson\u2019s death in an email on Tuesday. He did not provide a cause of death, although Nelson had battled lung cancer.",
      "Nelson was born in 1955 on a military base in Kansas. Her fraught relationship with her son, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III, has been no secret since the Detroit rapper became a star.",
      "Eminem has disparaged his mother in songs such as the 2002 single \u201cCleaning Out My Closet.\u201d Eminem sings: \u201cWitnessin\u2019 your mama poppin\u2019 prescription pills in the kitchen. ... My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn\u2019t.\u201d",

In her 2008 book, \u201cMy Son Marshall, My Son Eminem,\u201d she attempted to set the record straight by providing readers details about the rapper\u2019s early life, writing that Eminem had forgotten the good times they had.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oprah Winfrey has a new book club pick and a new platform to talk books and other topics of the day.",
      "On Tuesday, Winfrey launched \u201cThe Oprah Podcast,\u201d a weekly series airing on her YouTube channel that will feature book club authors and guests ranging from \u201cglobal newsmakers\u201d to \u201ccultural changemakers.\u201d Upcoming podcasts will feature author-chef Ina Garten and Dr. Vivek Murthy, the U.S. surgeon general, among others.",

      "\u201cTo know that Oprah Winfrey took pleasure in reading my book is the most exquisite compliment, which will last my lifetime,\u201d Keegan said in a statement. \u201cTo be told that she has also recommended it for others to read and has chosen this novel for her book club is a tremendous honor. May her wonderful book club encourage people into reading for years and years to come.\u201d",
      "Winfrey's interview with Keegan and other book club choices will be presented in partnership with Starbucks. Conversations will be filmed in various Starbucks cafes, starting with one in the Empire State Building, and the books will be paired with a Starbucks beverage. Winfrey previously worked with Starbucks in the 1990s for a project to raise literacy funds and in 2014 on Teavana Oprah Chai Tea, which raised millions for youth education organizations.",
      "\u201cConnecting with people about what matters to us in this moment, so we can all continue to reach our highest, truest potential is what I\u2019m most interested in offering at this time in my life,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement. \u201cAs one of my greatest pride and joys this past 30 years has been introducing books to new audiences, I am delighted to partner with Starbucks as we craft this new podcast. It is the perfect opportunity to bring together readers around things we both love: books, coffee and conversation.\u201d"

      "Break out your \u201cDune\u201d popcorn bucket: It's time for the best movies of the year",
      "As much as theaters are humming right now, with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2\" bringing moviegoers by the droves, it's been a fairly bruising movie year.",
      "In between the blockbusters, though, the challenge of not just capturing the attention of audiences but of simply getting to the screen feels more perilous than ever. The year was marked by filmmakers who wagered everything from a $120 million pile ( Francis Ford Coppola's \u201cMegalopolis\u201d ) to their life (the dissident Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof's \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\").",
      "Considering the paths of the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d (about Donald Trump's rise in New York) or the Israeli occupation documentary \u201cNo Other Land\u201d (which still lacks a distributor), the question of what gets released was a common and chilling refrain.",
      "That also made the movies that managed their way through \u2014 the ones that told urgent stories or dazzled with originality at a time of sequel stranglehold \u2014 all the more worth celebrating.",
      "Here are The Associated Press\u2019 Film Writers Jake Coyle and Lindsey Bahr's picks for the best movies of 2024:",
      "Was this a great year for movies? The consensus seems to be no, and that may be true. But it did produce some stone-cold masterpieces, none more so than Payal Kapadia\u2019s sublime tale of three women in modern Mumbai. It\u2019s a grittily real movie graced, in equally parts, by keen-eyed documentary and dreamy poetry. Beguilingly, \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d grows more profound as it cleaves further from reality. In theaters.",
      "Like Kapadia, RaMell Ross started out in documentary before bringing a singular eye to narrative film. His adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel, about two Black teenagers at an abusive reform school in the Jim Crow South, is shot mostly from the two boys\u2019 first-person perspective. The result is one of the most visually inventive American films of the decade and, just as certainly, one of the richest in empathy. Opens in theaters Dec. 13.",
      "So many of the reasons to go to the movies \u2014 to laugh at a clattering comic set piece, to witness the breakthrough of a young performer, to be devastated by something tragic \u2014 are contained within the thrillingly kitchen-sink \u201cAnora.\u201d It\u2019s a concoction that only Sean Baker could conceive, let alone execute. (And, by the way, if you liked Yura Borisov\u2019s performance alongside Mikey Madison, seek out 2021\u2019s \u201cCompartment No. 6.\u201d) In theaters.",
      "Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s sophomore feature \u2014 a dramatic leap forward for filmmaker and a transfixing trans parable \u2014 is a chilling 1990s coming of age in which a \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d-like series called \u201cThe Pink Opaque\u201d offers a possible portal out of drab suburban life and other suffocations. It feels chillingly, beautifully ripped out of Schoenbrun\u2019s soul \u2014 and it\u2019s got a killer soundtrack. Streaming on Max, available for digital rental.",
      "The fury of Agnieszka Holland\u2019s searing migrant drama is suitably calibrated to the crisis. Along the Poland-Belarus border, a small band of migrants from Syria and Afghanistan are sent back and forth across a wooded borderland \u2014 sometimes they're even literally tossed \u2014 in a grim game of \u201cnot in my backyard.\u201d It\u2019s not an easy movie to watch, nor should it be. To keep up with the times, more uncomfortable movies like this may be needed. Streaming on Kino Film Collection, available for digital rental.",
      "We also need more big, fun movies with Ryan Gosling. David Leitch\u2019s affectionate ode to stunt performers manages to celebrate behind-the-scenes crew members while simultaneously being completely carried by two of our most winning movie stars in Gosling and Emily Blunt. The societal value of watching Gosling cry to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cAll Too Well\u201d should not be underestimated. Streaming on Peacock, available for digital rental.",
      "The way the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof, who was forced into exile while editing this, condenses real-life social upheaval into a family drama makes this a uniquely disquieting film. Like Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cStray Dog,\u201d Rasoulof\u2019s movie centers around a lost handgun. The subsequent search reveals just how deeply the Iranian government's policies have seeped into the most intimate relationships. In theaters.",
      "We had not one but two movies this year that captured the therapeutic properties of theater. Each, almost unbelievably, deftly eludes tipping into cliche thanks to abiding compassion and authenticity in the performances. Alex Thompson and Kelly O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u201cGhostlight\u201d is about a grieving father, a construction worker (an exceptional Keith Kupferer), who reluctantly joins a local production of \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d \u201cSing Sing\u201d dramatizes a real rehabilitation prison program. Its screening at Sing Sing Correctional, where many of its performers were once incarcerated, was easily the most moving moviegoing experience of the year for me. \u201cGhostlight\u201d is available for digital rental. \u201cSing Sing\u201d returns to theaters Jan. 17.",
      "In Azazel Jacobs\u2019 funny, tender and raw family drama, a flawless cast of Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen and Natasha Lyonne play three sisters caring for their dying father. In close quarters and with death looming, it all comes out. Streaming on Netflix.",
      "In between large, lengthy epics, Martin Scorsese has made some his most interesting and personal films. In this, Scorsese narrates for director David Hinton his lifetime journey with the films of Powell and Pressburger, the great filmmakers of \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d \u201cI Know Where I\u2019m Going!\u201d and \u201cBlack Narcissus.\u201d As an expression of movie love \u2014 of the power of film to transfix you, to change your life, to live alongside you as you grow older \u2014 \u201cMade in England\u201d could hardly be more effusive. Such insightful, passionate testimonies are an increasingly necessary lifeblood in a film culture where algorithms are typically blind to the treasures of cinema\u2019s past. Streaming on WatchTCM and available for digital rental.",
      "Also: \u201cGrand Tour,\u201d \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d\u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d\u201cBetween the Temples,\u201d\u201cEvil Does Not Exist,\u201d \u201cUniversal Language,\u201d \u201cOn Becoming a Guinea Fowl,\u201d \u201cDaughters\u201d",
      "Steve McQueen tells a different kind of World War II story in \u201cBlitz,\u201d a powerful and clear-eyed odyssey through London during the German bombing raid. Structured around a 9-year-old boy (Elliott Heffernan) trying to make his way back to his mother (Saoirse Ronan), it is a sneakily revolutionary glimpse into and poignant elegy for worlds unexplored and stories untold. Streaming on Apple TV+.",
      "Poetic and transportive, Kapadia\u2019s Mumbai-set film explores the vibrations of a thrilling but brutally impersonal metropolis, the lives of three women in different stages and predicaments (forbidden love, loneliness, eviction) and delicacy of female friendships.",
      "Josh Margolin\u2019s debut feature about a 90-something (played by the incomparable June Squibb ) on a mission to get $10,000 back from a scammer is so modest in scope and effortlessly enjoyable that it\u2019s easy to undervalue. This independent film feels as sharp and put-together as a yesteryear studio comedy. It\u2019s pure joy and one of those movies you could recommend to anyone. Streaming on Hulu.",
      "It takes a special kind of movie to transcend the echo chamber of arthouse cinephelia and become a cultural moment, but Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d did it. A classic in waiting, Baker and his star Mikey Madison, who lifts the streetwise stripper trope, take audiences on an unforgettable ride in this fairy tale that falls apart in spectacular fashion.",
      "Ross transforms Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer-winning novel about the abuses and generational trauma of a reform school in the Jim Crow South for the screen by employing first-person point-of-view. It\u2019s a bold choice that pays off, transporting you into the heartbreaking reality of Elwood and Turner, two characters you won\u2019t soon forget.",
      "A Zambian family says goodbye to their Uncle Fred in this remarkable, semicomic film from writer-director Rungano Nyoni. With an eye for the beautifully absurd and a keen understanding of generational trauma and toxic familial cycles, Nyoni has firmly established herself as a major talent. In theaters Dec. 13.",
      "Decades of dreaming about a film does not always seem to benefit said film, but Denis Villeneuve was able to translate his passion for Frank Herbert\u2019s opus into pure cinematic spectacle, and doom, about the rise of a leader. It\u2019s a grand and thrilling adventure that could make sci-fi nerds out of us all. Streaming on MAX.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg grapples with modern and historical trauma in the disarmingly entertaining road trip film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d which he wrote, directed and stars in alongside Kieran Culkin as cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland. In theaters.",
      "Saoirse Ronan delivered one of the year\u2019s absolute best performances as an alcoholic who goes further and further into seclusion in the Orkney Islands in an attempt to start life anew. Films about addiction are hardly novel, and yet Nora Fingscheidt captures the wild highs, lows and in-betweens of the human condition with unapologetic honesty. Available for digital rental.",
      "It was a great year for first-time directors, including India Donaldson whose quietly brilliant character study of a teenage girl on a camping trip with her dad and his friend resonates even a year later. Streaming on Apple TV+",
      "Also: \u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d; \u201cGreen Border\u201d; \u201cChallengers\u201d; \u201dBeetlejuice Beetlejuice \u201d; \u201cLa Cocina\u201d; \u201cWill & Harper\u201d; \u201cEvil Does Not Exist\u201d; \u201dConclave\u201d; \u201cMaria\u201d; \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d; \u201cTuesday\u201d; \u201cLee\u201d."

      "Nearly three out of 10 U.S. drugstores that were open during the previous decade had closed by 2021, new research shows.",
      "Black and Latino neighborhoods were most vulnerable to the retail pharmacy closures, which can chip away at already-limited care options in those communities, researchers said in a study published Tuesday in Health Affairs.",
      "The trend has potentially gained momentum since the study's timeframe, because many drugstores are still struggling. In the last three years, the major chains Walgreens and CVS have closed hundreds of additional stores, and Rite Aid shrank as it went through a bankruptcy reorganization.",
      "Drugstores have been dealing with shrinking reimbursement for prescriptions, rising costs and changing customer shopping habits. The chains have been closing money-losing stores and transferring prescription files to more profitable locations.",
      "The study found that more than 29% of the nearly 89,000 retail U.S. pharmacies that operated between 2010 and 2020 had closed by 2021. That amounts to more than 26,000 stores.",
      "Researchers using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs found that the number of U.S. pharmacies had actually increased from 2010 to 2017 because of store openings, but the pace of closings picked up starting in 2018.",
      "They also highlighted which stores were more likely to close. Those include independent pharmacies, which were more likely than chain stores to be in Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.",
      "Pharmacies in neighborhoods with higher rates of patients on government-funded Medicaid and Medicare also were at greater risk for closing, said Dima Qato, a University of Southern California pharmacy professor who was the study's lead author. Those programs tend to reimburse less than private health insurance.",
      "Researchers also noted that the exclusion of some pharmacies, particularly independent drugstores, from pharmacy benefit manager networks can hurt. That can mean fewer prescriptions and customers visit for those stores.",
      "Retail drugstores can be important sources for vaccinations, contraception, overdose prevention and opioid use disorder treatments, aside from prescriptions, Qato said. She noted that Black and Latino communities often have fewer pharmacies to begin with, so store closings hit residents of those communities particularly hard.",

      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures this year to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Reproductive rights advocates in Arizona on Tuesday sued to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with that state's new constitutional amendment expanding access up to fetal viability.",
      "The Missouri amendment does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, an abortion opponent, last week issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions will be legal when the amendment takes effect Thursday.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "Other abortion laws that Bailey is defending include a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.",
      "The Attorney General's Office argued that Planned Parenthood has not proven it will be negatively impacted by those laws, noting that no abortions have been scheduled yet.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood concedes they have no appointments scheduled for right after the amendment goes into effect and have not even tried to obtain relevant licenses or create necessary complication plans,\" state attorneys wrote in a court brief.",
      "It is unclear when Zhang will rule on the request for a preliminary injunction."

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:06:23 -0500",

      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, falsely claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent",
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent.",
      "The ruling addressed a lawsuit filed by Dario and Shujen Politella against Windham Southeast School District and state officials over the mistaken vaccination of their child against COVID-19 in 2021, when he was 6 years old. A lower court had dismissed the original complaint, as well as an amended version. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on Nov. 19.",
      "But the ruling by Vermont's high court is not as far-reaching as some online have claimed. In reality, it concluded that anyone protected under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP, Act is immune to state lawsuits.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that schools can vaccinate children against their parents' wishes.",
      "THE FACTS: The claim stems from a July 26 ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court, which found that anyone protected by the PREP Act is immune to state lawsuits, including the officials named in the Politella's suit. The ruling does not authorize schools to vaccinate children at their discretion.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the Politella's son \u2014 referred to as L.P. \u2014 was given one dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic held at Academy School in Brattleboro even though his father, Dario, told the school's assistant principal a few days before that his son was not to receive a vaccination. In what officials described as a mistake, L.P. was removed from class and had a \u201chandwritten label\u201d put on his shirt with the name and date of birth of another student, L.K., who had already been vaccinated that day. L.P. was then vaccinated.",
      "Ultimately, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that officials involved in the case could not be sued.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the PREP Act immunizes every defendant in this case and this fact alone is enough to dismiss the case,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling reads. \u201cWe conclude that when the federal PREP Act immunizes a defendant, the PREP Act bars all state-law claims against that defendant as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "The PREP Act, enacted by Congress in 2005, authorizes the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a declaration in the event of a public health emergency providing immunity from liability for activities related to medical countermeasures, such as the administration of a vaccine, except in cases of \u201cwillful misconduct\" that result in \u201cdeath or serious physical injury.\u201d A declaration against COVID-19 was issued on March 17, 2020. It is set to expire on Dec. 31. Federals suits claiming willful misconduct are filed in Washington.",
      "Social media users described the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling as having consequences beyond what it actually says.",
      "\u201cThe Vermont Supreme Court has ruled that schools can force-vaccinate children for Covid against the wishes of their parents,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 16,600 times as of Tuesday. \u201cThe high court ruled on a case involving a 6-year-old boy who was forced to take a Covid mRNA injection by his school. However, his family had explicitly stated that they didn't want their child to receive the \u2018vaccines.\u2019\u201d",
      "Other users alleged that the ruling gives schools permission to give students any vaccine without parental consent, not just ones for COVID-19.",
      "Rod Smolla, president of the Vermont Law and Graduate School and an expert on constitutional law, told The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cmerely holds that the federal statute at issue, the PREP Act, preempts state lawsuits in cases in which officials mistakenly administer a vaccination without consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion states that school officials can vaccinate a child against the instructions of the parent,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Asked whether the claims spreading online have any merit, Ronald Ferrara, an attorney representing the Politellas, told the AP that although the ruling doesn't say schools can vaccinate students regardless of parental consent, officials could interpret it to mean that they could get away with doing so under the PREP Act, at least when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. He explained that the U.S. Supreme Court appeal seeks to clarify whether the Vermont Supreme Court interpreted the PREP Act beyond what Congress intended.",
      "\u201cThe Politella\u2019s fundamental liberty interest to decide whether their son should receive elective medical treatment was denied by agents of the State and School,\u201d he wrote in an email to the AP. \u201cThe Vermont Court misconstrues the scope of PREP Act immunity (which is conditioned upon informed consent for medical treatments unapproved by FDA), to cover this denial of rights and its underlying battery.\u201d",
      "Ferrara added that he was not aware of the claims spreading online, but that he \u201ccan understand how lay people may conflate the court's mistaken grant of immunity for misconduct as tantamount to blessing such misconduct.\u201d",
      "John Klar, who also represents the Politellas, went a step further, telling the AP that the Vermont Supreme Court ruling means that \u201cas a matter of law\u201d schools can get away with vaccinating students without parental consent and that parents can only sue on the federal level if death or serious bodily injury results.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Thirteen women from the Philippines have been convicted on human trafficking-related charges for acting as surrogates in Cambodia for a ring selling babies to foreigners for cash.",
      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",
      "The women were arrested in late September in a raid on a villa in Kandal province, where authorities found 20 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.",
      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.",
      "Cambodia has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries.",
      "The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal.",
      "In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services."

      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that most of Idaho's first-in-the-nation law that makes it illegal to help minors get an abortion without the consent of their parents can take effect while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality continues.",
      "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the statute\u2019s prohibition on helping a minor get an abortion by harboring and transporting them with the intent to conceal the procedure from the minor\u2019s parents is likely to be found constitutional and can be enforced.",
      "Part of the law remains blocked, however. The court found that the law\u2019s prohibition on \u201crecruiting\u201d pregnant youth violates the First Amendment. That means prosecutors, for now, will not be able to charge a person with \u201crecruiting\u201d or influencing a minor to have an abortion.",
      "\"Encouragement, counseling, and emotional support are plainly protected speech,\u201d the court wrote, even when that speech happens in the \u201ccontext of deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d",
      "The ruling largely reverses U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham's decision, which prevented the law from being enforced after opponents sued the state in the summer of 2023.",
      "Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in 2023 was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 permission.",
      "Supporters of the law call it an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights. Both sides framed Monday's ruling as a victory.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion health care,\u201d Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "She said the plaintiffs, which include multiple advocacy groups, are also considering their appeal options.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in an emailed statement called the ruling a victory for the state.",
      "\u201cIdaho\u2019s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother, Labrador said. \"Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\u201d",
      "The law makes it illegal to either obtain abortion pills for a minor or to help them leave the state for an abortion without their parents\u2019 knowledge and consent. Anyone convicted will face two to five years in prison and could also be sued by the minor\u2019s parent or guardian. A parent who raped their child will not be able to sue, though the criminal penalties for anyone who helped the minor obtain an abortion will remain in effect."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",

      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 31, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

      "The federal government has closed its investigation into an E",
      "The U.S. government said Tuesday it has closed its investigation into an E. coli outbreak tied to McDonald's Quarter Pounder hamburgers after determining there is no longer a safety risk.",
      "The outbreak, which was first reported Oct. 22, sickened at least 104 people in 14 states, including 34 who were hospitalized, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One person in Colorado died and four people developed a potentially life-threatening kidney disease complication.",
      "The FDA, which conducted the investigation along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state health departments, linked the outbreak to yellow onions distributed by California-based Taylor Farms and served raw on Quarter Pounders at McDonald\u2019s restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, Wyoming and other states.",
      "There have been no new cases reported since Oct. 21, when McDonald's pulled the Quarter Pounder off its menu in the affected states, the CDC said Tuesday. Taylor Farms initiated a voluntary recall of yellow onions on Oct. 22.",
      "Federal and state health officials in Colorado didn\u2019t find the strain of E. coli that caused the illnesses in onions it tested or in any samples from the environment. But they concluded that evidence showed that recalled yellow onions were the likely source of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is no longer serving recalled onions and there does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak,\u201d the FDA said Tuesday in a statement.",
      "McDonald's briefly pulled Quarter Pounders from 3,000 U.S. stores as a result of the outbreak, then narrowed that to 900 stores once testing had pinpointed onions \u2014 and not hamburger patties \u2014 as the likely source of E. coli. The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",
      "Chicago-based McDonald's wouldn't say Tuesday whether its sales have returned to normal levels in the affected regions. But it thanked U.S. regulators for their quick action and said it remains confident in its rigorous food-safety standards.",
      "McDonald's last major food-safety issue happened in 2018, when more than 500 people contracted an intestinal illness after eating its salads.",
      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",
      "\u201cWith kids, when you want to go out to eat, they want to go to McDonald\u2019s. They want to get a Happy Meal,\u201d West said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t trust it anymore.\u201d"

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "Here's the latest:",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has coached his daughters\u2019 youth basketball teams, asked about the impact of a ruling on gender-affirming care in that realm.",
      "\u201cIf you prevail here on the standard of review, what would that mean for women and girls sports?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould transgender athletes have a constitutional right to participate in girls\u2019 sports?\u201d",
      "At least 24 states have adopted restrictions on transgender women and girls in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. There have also been legal challenges to those laws, with mixed verdicts so far.",
      "Prelogar said that\u2019s a different issue and suggested the court could say in an opinion that sides with her argument that the Tennessee law would not impact the sports issue.",
      "\u201cHow do we as a court choose which set of risks is more serious in deciding whether to constitutionalize this whole area?\u201d Kavanaugh said.",
      "Research and reports from individual doctors and clinics suggest that detransitioning is rare.",
      "Twenty-six states have passed versions of bans.",
      "Prelogar said some might stand up to heightened scrutiny by courts than others.",
      "\u201cWe do think there is a real space for states to regulate here,\u201d Prelogar said.",
      "She pointed to West Virginia\u2019s as one that might fare better because it gives a path for treatment for teens who are considered by medical providers to be at risk for self-harm or suicide.",
      "During questioning by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Prelogar noted that every major medical organization has supported gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and many have filed briefs supporting the challenge to Tennessee\u2019s law.",
      "\u201cSome children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, some attempt suicide,\u201d Sotomayor said.",
      "The groups include the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Justices Thomas and Alito both asked about when the states can and cannot have sex-based laws.",
      "\u201cWe think the court just needs to recognize the sex-based classification and send this case back,\u201d Prelogar said, adding that the treatments can be \u201ccritical, sometimes lifesaving, care to individuals with severe gender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Tennessee\u2019s law bars puberty blockers and hormone treatment only for transgender minors.",
      "The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probably will decide this case.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the Justices stand:",
      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs.",
      "Three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, dissented on that case.",
      "Barrett has no high court track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "If the parties challenging the Tennessee law hope to win, they need at least two conservative justices on their side, along with the three liberal members of the court.",
      "Alito, who seems likely to vote to uphold the Tennessee ban, is using his questioning of Prelogar to persuade his colleagues that this case is different from the one four years ago where the court sided with LGBTQ+ people.",
      "The Bostock decision in 2020 found that the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 banned discrimination against LGBTQ+ people in the workplace.",
      "That \u201cinvolved the interpretation of particular language in a particular statute,\u201d Alito said.",
      "This case involves the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause, a key provision of the 14th Amendment.",
      "Alito focused on where European countries stand on gender-affirming care for minors, noting that Finland, Norway and Sweden have policies discouraging it from being available routinely to minors.",
      "Prelogar noted that those countries don\u2019t go as far as Tennessee\u2019s outright ban on the treatments for transgender minors.",
      "The report asserts there is \u201cno good evidence on the long-term outcomes of interventions to manage gender-related distress.\u201d",
      "But advocates for transgender people have a lot of questions about the report.",
      "\u25b6The AP delved into it here",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts, who is one of the most closely watched justices in this case and previously voted in favor of transgender rights in the workplace, is asking whether this question might be best left to state legislatures.",
      "Prelogar responds that the state does have regulatory powers, but argues Tennessee\u2019s law is too broad.",
      "Supreme Court arguments have begun over Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors. The first attorney to argue is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, arguing against the ban.",
      "The Republican-controlled Statehouse and GOP Gov. Bill Lee have signed off on legislation banning transgender athletes from participating in girls\u2019 sports.",
      "Republicans have also blocked businesses from setting their own rules about bathroom access \u2014 a move that critics have warned targets transgender people.",
      "This year, they placed a ban on the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners and required public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Shortly after enacting the ban on gender-affirming care, the Republican-dominant Legislature also passed legislation penalizing adults who help minors receive gender-affirming care without parental consent.",
      "Supporters of the proposal couldn\u2019t point to any examples of minors leaving the state to receive gender-affirming care without their parent\u2019s consent, but said it was needed anyway to protect children.",
      "Republican Gov. Bill Lee later signed off on the first-in-the-nation proposal.",
      "Over the years, Republican-dominant Tennessee has not only been among the top states to introduce the most anti-LGBTQ+ legislation but also the top state to enact such legislation.",
      "According to the Human Rights Campaign, Tennessee has enacted more anti-LGBTQ+ laws than any other state since 2015, identifying more than 20 bills that advanced out of the Legislature earlier this year. That includes Gov. Bill Lee signing off on bills banning the spending of state money on hormone therapy or sex reassignment procedures for prisoners \u2014 though it would not apply to state inmates currently receiving hormone therapy \u2014 and requiring public school employees to out transgender students to their parents.",
      "Attorneys for the families challenging Tennessee\u2019s law have warned a ruling upholding the measure could open the door for more attempts to restrict the care for transgender adults as well as youth.",
      "Florida is the only state that has enacted a law restricting gender-affirming care for transgender adults, though similar restrictions have been attempted in at least two other states.",
      "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine\u2019s administration earlier this year proposed and then backed off rules that advocates said would have blocked access to gender-affirming care provided by independent clinics and general practitioners.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican attorney general last year pushed for an emergency rule that would have placed limits on care for adults, but state officials abruptly dropped it. Missouri later this year enacted a law banning some gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Most adults still are allowed to access gender-affirming health care under the Missouri law, but Medicaid won\u2019t cover it.",
      "Arguing for the Biden administration is U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar. She\u2019s the second woman to serve in the role in the country\u2019s history, and this could be the last major case she argues as solicitor general \u2014 essentially the federal government\u2019s top lawyer before the Supreme Court.",
      "Matt Rice, Tennessee\u2019s state solicitor general, will defend the law before the high court. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from a ruling that term that a landmark civil rights law protects LGBTQ+ workers.",
      "The treatments at the heart of today\u2019s arguments are also used by minors who are not transgender, including intersex people. Tennessee and other states have not tried to ban puberty blockers or hormone treatments for those uses.",
      "Puberty blockers can be used to delay sexual development in children who go through puberty before age 8 or 9. Adolescents with delayed puberty can be treated with hormones.",
      "Thomas was famously silent during arguments for years at a time because he said he relied on written briefs and thought his colleagues interrupted too much.",
      "But when the court started hearing cases remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic, the justices altered their practice and asked questions one by one, instead of the usual free-for-all. Even after they returned to the courtroom, the justices have informally agreed to allow Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, to go first.",
      "He has asked questions at every argument session he\u2019s attended since the court\u2019s first remote arguments in May 2020.",
      "Don\u2019t be fooled by the hour the court has allotted. The session could easily go twice as long.",
      "Gone are the days when Chief Justice William Rehnquist would cut lawyers off mid-sentence when the red light went on at their podium. Chief Justice John Roberts was more lenient even before the coronavirus pandemic forced changes to the structure of the arguments.",
      "But the administration\u2019s position seems likely to change after Trump takes office.",
      "He campaigned against transgender rights, using demeaning language and misrepresentations as he pledged to remove \u201ctransgender insanity\u201d in schools and restrict participation in women\u2019s sports.",
      "Brian Williams of Nashville, Tennessee, says his transgender daughter, L.W., has to travel to another state to receive the health care that \u201cwe and her doctors know is right for her.\u201d",
      "Williams, speaking on a Zoom call arranged by the legal team representing the family and others at the Supreme Court, said L.W. approached him and his wife, Samantha, several years ago to share \u201chonestly and openly her pain\u201d over her gender identity.",
      "She began taking puberty-blocking drugs at age 13 and started hormone therapy a year later, Williams says.",
      "Today, her father says, she is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",
      "Williams says he\u2019s not expecting people to understand everything about the family. But he asks others to \u201copen your hearts and listen.\u201d",
      "President-elect Trump backed a national ban on such care as part of his 2024 campaign in which he demeaned and mocked transgender people. Trump and his allies also promised to roll back protections for transgender people throughout the campaign.",
      "Meanwhile, in its waning days, the Biden administration, along with families of transgender adolescents, will appeal to the justices to strike down the Tennessee ban as unlawful sex discrimination and protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable Americans.",
      "Earlier this year, the administration and Democrat-led states extended protections for transgender people, including a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.",
      "People on both sides of the issue are gathered outside the court for demonstrations that are increasing in volume ahead of arguments.",
      "They carried signs reading \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters\u201d on one side and \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves\u201d on the other.",
      "Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk outside the court\u2019s marble steps.",
      "Multiple bills related to transgender youth have already been filed in Texas\u2019 legislature ahead of its session next year.",
      "The proposals include a bill that would make it easier to sue providers of gender-affirming medical care for children.",
      "Other bills include restrictions on which public restrooms transgender people can use, and limits on how topics related to sexual orientation and gender identity are taught in schools.",
      "At least 26 states have adopted laws banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors. Federal judges in Arkansas and Florida have struck down the bans in those states as unconstitutional, though an appeals court has put the Florida ruling on hold. The ban in New Hampshire is to take effect on Jan. 1.",
      "Several Democratic-controlled states have policies seeking to protect access to gender-affirming care.",
      "Additionally, at least 24 states have bans barring transgender women and girls from competing in certain women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. And at least 11 have laws barring transgender women and girls from using girls\u2019 and women\u2019s bathrooms at public schools \u2014 and in some cases, in other government facilities.",
      "Most laws are reviewed and upheld under the lowest level of scrutiny, known as rational basis review. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally in adopting the law to address the risks they perceived in gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "But when discrimination is present, judges take a closer look.",
      "Sex discrimination gets heightened scrutiny, which requires states to identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it. Racial discrimination, not at issue here, is reviewed under strict scrutiny \u2014 the highest level \u2014 and laws rarely survive such a demanding examination.",
      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs. Three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Brett Kavanaugh and Clarence Thomas, dissented.",
      "If the parties challenging the Tennessee law hope to win, they need at least two conservative justices on their side, along with the three liberal members of the court. Barrett has no track record on transgender issues, although she votes with the other conservatives in most of the high-profile cases.",
      "The Supreme Court almost always issues its decisions by early summer, usually before the end of June. The transgender health case could be one of the last cases decided, which is typical of highly contentious issues. One additional potential cause for delay is the Trump administration could weigh in soon after he takes office. It\u2019s not clear how that might affect the case.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation\u2019s highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he\u2019s an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He\u2019s also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army veteran brother.",
      "\u25b6 Read more about Strangio and his history as a transgender advocate",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s only other major case on transgender rights was in 2020 when the court ruled that workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ people was sex discrimination in violation of the federal civil rights law commonly known as Title VII.",
      "The court concluded in separate cases involving a gay man and a transgender woman that they were discriminated against because of their sex. Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Donald Trump\u2019s in his first term in the White House, wrote the 6-3 opinion for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts was the only other conservative member of the court in the majority.",
      "The nation\u2019s top court will be weighing whether Tennessee\u2019s law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Both sides in the case claim they are acting to protect minors from harm.",
      "Transgender attorney Chase Strangio will represent families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban leaves them terrified for the future and that access to this kind of care is life-saving.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely."

    "story": [
      "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Tuesday to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with a constitutional amendment recently approved by voters to expand access up to fetal viability.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed the lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court on behalf of the local chapter of Planned Parenthood and two physicians, arguing the law interferes with pregnant Arizonans\u2019 fundamental right to abortion and individual autonomy. It\u2019s the first step in efforts to dismantle existing laws they say are too restrictive.",
      "The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature approved the 15-week ban months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but it didn't go into effect until after. Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to enforce the 15-week ban while the lawsuit plays out, spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said in a statement Tuesday that the ban should be removed from the books.",
      "\u201cArizonans made it clear that they support reproductive freedom, and there is no question that a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest should be removed from our laws,\" she said, adding that she is \"glad Arizonans are working to finish the job and enforce the constitutional protections we now enjoy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also seeks to undo the ban\u2019s enforcement mechanisms, which could lead to criminal charges against providers who knowingly or intentionally perform abortions beyond 15 weeks except in medical emergencies. Physicians who violate the ban could face suspension or revocation of their medical licenses.",
      "\u201cThe amendment itself does not sort of wipe the statute books clean, you know. Further action is needed in order to take that additional step to effectuate the amendment\u2019s promise,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Rebecca Chan said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really what this 15-week ban challenge is.\u201d",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment to codify its existing abortion rights in the state constitution, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Arizona ballot measure gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a near-total abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "The measure expands access to fetal viability \u2014 the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame for viability, doctors say it\u2019s sometime after 21 weeks. It allows abortions after viability if they are necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the mother, or to save her life.",
      "Most abortions happen early in pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of them nationally in 2022 were in the first 13 weeks, though that data does not include California and some other states where advocates believe a higher proportion of abortions are performed later in pregnancy.",
      "The Nov. 25 certification of the general election opened the door for legal challenges to laws that conflict with the ballot measure, including a law that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows.",
      "Reproductive rights groups signaled then that they would sue over the 15-week abortion ban.",
      "\u201cClearly Planned Parenthood and ACLU and their allies have little regard for the life of an unborn child and the development of an unborn child,\" said Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy. Herrod previosly said the group would seek to intervene where appropriate.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have banned or restricted access to abortion, and abortion rights groups have pushed back.",
      "In Missouri, Planned Parenthood affiliates sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote in an opinion that he will enforce some laws restricting abortion despite voter approval of a constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure."

      "Tom Fletcher, a longtime British diplomat who took up the U.N. post last month, said his agency is asking for less money in 2025 than this year. He said it wants to show \"we will focus and target the resources we have,\u201d even as crises grow more numerous, intense and long-lasting.",
      "His agency, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on Wednesday issued its global appeal for 2025, seeking $47 billion to help 190 million people in 32 countries \u2014 though it estimates 305 million worldwide need help.",
      "\u201cThe world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,\u201d he told reporters on Tuesday.",
      "The office and many other aid groups, including the international Red Cross, have seen donations shrink in recent years for longtime trouble spots like Syria, South Sudan, the Middle East and Congo and newer ones like Ukraine and Sudan. Aid access has been difficult in some places, especially Sudan and Gaza.",
      "The office's appeal for $50 billion for this year was only 43% fulfilled as of last month. One consequence of that shortfall was a 80% reduction in food aid for Syria, which has seen a sudden escalation in fighting in recent days.",
      "Such funds go to U.N. agencies and more than 1,500 partner organizations.",
      "The biggest asks for 2025 are for Syria \u2014 a total of $8.7 billion for needs both within the country and for neighbors that have taken in Syrian refugees \u2014 as well as Sudan at a total of $6 billion, the \u201cOccupied Palestinian Territory\u201d at $4 billion, Ukraine at about $3.3 billion and Congo at nearly $3.2 billion.",
      "Fletcher said his office needs to be \u201cruthless\u201d in choosing to reach people most in need.",
      "\u201cI choose that word carefully, because it's a judgement call \u2014 that ruthlessness \u2014 about prioritizing where the funding goes and where we can have the greatest impact,\" he said. \u201cIt's a recognition that we have struggled in previous years to raise the money we need.\u201d",

      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by another 25 states and a range of other efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use.",
      "The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people.",
      "There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court\u2019s marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters,\u201d while the other side proclaimed \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves.\"",
      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not \u201cacross the board,\u201d lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices.",
      "The administration argues there is no way to determine whether \u201ctreatments must be withheld from any particular minor\u201d without considering the minor's sex.",
      "\u201cThat is sex discrimination,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing.",
      "The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures.\u201d",
      "The law \u201cdraws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief.",
      "While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",
      "If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it.",
      "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response.",
      "The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee, are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that as a result of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a \u201c16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.\u201d",
      "But because of Tennessee's ban, she has to travel to another state to receive the health care that \u201cwe and her doctors know is right for her.\u201d",

      "A majority of Supreme Court justices didn\u2019t seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use",
      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet-flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The conservative-majority court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to its lowest level in a decade, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vaping companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as it blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers after the company provided data showing the product was more helpful in quitting, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" and \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",
      "Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern about what recourse companies have if agencies issue misleading guidance, though he also elicited that the FDA wasn't required to issue the guidance it gave in the vaping case. \u201cI'm trying to figure out what the legal error is here,\u201d he said.",
      "The vaping companies, he said, can reapply for sales authorization even if they don't win in court. Triton attorney Eric Heyer said that process would take so long that the company could be forced to close.",
      "The court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months.",

      "An official of a union involved in the anti-smoking push on Monday called for the head of the Atlantic City casino workers' union, Donna DeCaprio, to resign for failing to protect her members from the dangers of secondhand smoke.",
      "DeCaprio is president of Local 54 of the Unite Here union, which opposes a smoking ban on the grounds that so much business would be lost by smokers taking their money elsewhere that it could cause one or more casinos to shut down, costing thousands of workers their jobs.",
      "\u201cShe should be ashamed of herself,\u201d said Ray Jensen, assistant director of United Auto Workers Region 9, which represents dealers at three Atlantic City casinos and is part of a lawsuit seeking to have the courts force an end to smoking in the gambling halls. \u201cShe should hand in her union card.\u201d",
      "DeCaprio said her union supports the health and safety of its members, adding improvements to the workplace environment need to be made.",
      "\u201cA balance needs to be reached that will both protect worker health and preserve good jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are protecting our members against multiple casino closures and job losses.

      "DeCaprio said between 50% and 72% of all in-person casino revenue in Atlantic City comes from smoking sections, which occupy only 25% of the casino floor.",

      "Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has said he will sign a bill to end casino smoking if it reaches his desk.",
      "The casinos, joined by Local 54, oppose that effort, saying it will cost Atlantic City thousands of jobs and lead to decreased tax revenue for state programs for senior citizens and the disabled.",
      "On Monday, the workers group that calls itself CEASE (Casino Employees Against Smoking\u2019s Effects) filed an appeal of a court ruling in August that allowed smoking to continue in the nine casinos.",
      "The Casino Association of New Jersey declined to comment Monday.",
      "Attorney Nancy Erika Smith said as far back as 1993, tobacco companies targeted labor unions in the hospitality industry as potential allies to work against smoking bans in the restaurant and hospitality industries. That effort included the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, a precursor of the Unite Here union.",
      "\u201cHERE and the related AFL-CIO affiliates are critical allies which should be cultivated as supporters of the effort to prevent smoking bans,\u201d a public relations firm wrote in a memo to Philip Morris Companies that was made public during several states' litigation against tobacco companies. The memo said having HERE \u201cas an ally in this effort would be a very powerful voice.\u201d",
      "As far back as 2001, HERE was part of a 12-member coalition including labor unions advocating for improved indoor ventilation instead of government-imposed smoking bans, according to another document cited in Monday's appeal.",
      "The anti-smoking campaigners cite a 2022 report by Las Vegas-based C3 Gaming, a consulting firm, showing that casinos that went smoke-free \"appear to be performing better than their counterparts that continue to allow smoking.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",

Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",

      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",

      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",

    "title": "First transgender attorney to argue before the Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for minors",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:18:29 -0500",
    "summary": "The issue of transgender rights animated the presidential campaign",

      "The issue of transgender rights animated the presidential campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trump put his fierce opposition front and center.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.",
      "He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.",
      "\u201cTennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,\u201d state attorneys wrote in court filings.",
      "Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government\u2019s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.",
      "\u201cMany of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,\u201d he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.",
      "\u201cThere is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,\u201d he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 12:02:34 -0500",
    "summary": "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
    "story": [
      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

    "summary": "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
    "story": [
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional care homes, worried about abandonment and quality issues",
      "HONG KONG -- Every Wednesday, retiree Zhang Zhili travels an hour by bus to an education center, drawn by the pulsing rhythms of the African drum she plays there in a classroom filled with fellow retirees whose hands move in unison, every beat lifting her spirits.",
      "Zhang, 71, has found joy and new friends at the \u201celderly university\u201d in Beijing. Besides African drums, the former primary school teacher joins social dance classes, paying about 2,000 yuan ($280) for two courses this semester. Seeing herself standing tall in dance class boosts her confidence. After class, she hangs out with her friends.",
      "\u201cWhen we get old, what do we need?\" she said. \u201cTo love ourselves.\u201d",
      "Many older Chinese are looking beyond traditional nursing homes, afraid of abandonment by their families and quality issues. That's driving a boom in universities, home care services, and communities catering to older adults. Though some providers struggle to turn a profit, they persist because they see promise in the growing market.",
      "China has a rapidly aging population. Last year, about 297 million people were aged 60 or above, over one-fifth of the population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 400 million, or over 30% of all Chinese.",
      "That's fueling growth in services and products aimed at older adults in what Beijing calls the silver economy, which is projected to balloon from about 7 trillion yuan (about $982 billion) currently to approximately 30 trillion yuan (about $4.2 trillion) in 2035, raising its share in the economy from about 6% to roughly 10%, Hu Zuquan, a researcher at the State Information Center, a public institution affiliated with China's main planning agency, told state media.",
      "Du Peng, dean of the school of population and health at Beijing's Renmin University, said the government is expanding basic care services to all older people who need them, moving beyond its traditional focus on those without family support. Last year, officials compiled a list of basic care services they aim to make available nationwide, including providing ability assessments for those over 65 and care training subsidies for family members of those who are disabled.",
      "Filial piety runs deep in China and most older people prefer aging at home with family after they retire, typically when they're 50 to 60 years old, one of the youngest retirement ages among the world\u2019s major economies. Many help care for their grandchildren, and for some, nursing homes are seen as a kind of abandonment, except in cases of serious disability.",
      "In January, Beijing issued new guidelines calling for expanding home care services and meal deliveries and more clothing, food and tech products tailored for older adults. They include enriching their lives through education.",
      "Home-based services offer a more affordable alternative to nursing homes, alleviating accommodation costs, Du said. Most older Chinese are relatively healthy, and these able people perhaps need richer cultural lives rather than disability care, he said.",
      "Cai Guixia, 60, said she has found fulfillment in African drumming and modeling classes. She thinks she would feel \u201cforsaken\u201d in a conventional nursing home, preferring to hire a domestic helper.",
      "Liu Xiuqin, an owner of two care homes, saw business opportunities in meeting those needs.",
      "She invested more than 800,000 yuan (about $112,000) to open a school in Beijing. Cai and Zhang are among its 150 students attending classes in dance, singing, yoga and modeling training for about 1,000 yuan ($140) per course each semester. Outside the classroom, her team organizes gatherings where students can socialize.",
      "Liu expects to break even in another year and is prepared for the wait. She believes in the market's future, given that the generation born in the 1960s and later values quality of life and health more than their parents did.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about making quick money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt requires persistence.\u201d",
      "Turning a profit is proving challenging for some silver economy businesses.",
      "In the southern city of Guangzhou, Wu Tang co-founded a school last year after his geotechnical investigation and surveying business was hit by the downturn in China\u2019s property market. His school offers courses to help people achieve some of their childhood dreams, but he has yet to cover his costs. He also faces competition from cheaper government-run courses.",
      "And there's Cui Yang, who runs a care station in Beijing, sending helpers zigzagging across the district to provide 30 yuan ($4.20) haircuts at home; accompanying people on hospital visits for 50 yuan ($7) per hour and other services. Even with government subsidies including free rent, Cui is losing money. Without the subsidies, the business would fail, she said.",
      "The struggles aren\u2019t limited to small operators.",
      "Wu Wenjing heads the home care department of a healthcare subsidiary of state-owned financial conglomerate China Everbright Group in southwest China's Chongqing. It has been in the red for 13 straight years, spending 5 million yuan (about $702,000) annually and still losing 1 million (about $140,000) a year, she said.",
      "Wu's business employs 70 workers who visit homes as caregivers, rehabilitation therapists and psychotherapists. The industry is competitive and it has a high turnover rate given the difficulties of working alone in clients\u2019 homes. Wu hopes to break even in five years, and is delighted about the government's efforts to grow the silver economy.",
      "\"The spring of China\u2019s elderly care business has finally come,\u201d she said.",
      "Various companies are looking to grab a slice of this government-backed market. Property developers like Vanke Co. and Sino-Ocean Group and insurance companies such as Taikang Insurance Group have built high-end communities for older adults with amenities such as movie-screening and mahjong rooms and dining services.",
      "China's also working to tackle the problem of dementia, providing cognitive screening tests and training staff who work in memory clinics or as social workers. Several Chinese pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are working on drugs targeting Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia.",
      "Some vacant schools and kindergartens -- casualties of the country\u2019s declining birthrate -- are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people.",
      "Government efforts to back the silver economy are paying off: official data showed the country had 410,000 care facilities by June, double the number in 2019.",
      "Still, questions remain about the spending power of many older Chinese.",
      "A 2021 national survey co-conducted by China's Civil Affairs Ministry found older adults had a median annual income of 11,400 yuan ($1,574). In rural areas it was less than half of that. More than one in 10 older Chinese are living in poverty, with living standards much lower in rural areas and western China, according to data from surveys conducted by Peking University.",
      "China's silver economy is still in its infancy, said Gary Ng, a senior economist at Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking.",
      "If they lack enough insurance to cover medical and other expenses, many older Chinese must set aside funds for such costs, limiting their spending capacity, he said, and it takes time to build industries producing senior-focused products and people trained to provide such services. Tax incentives and investments in training a skilled workforce would help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere are prospects here, but it seems there's still much that needs to be done,\u201d he said.",

      "British lawmakers are expected to vote on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives",
      "LONDON -- British lawmakers are expected to vote Friday on a law proposed to help terminally ill adults end their lives.",
      "The contentious bill would allow adults expected to have fewer than six months to live to request and be provided with help to end their life, subject to safeguards and protections.",
      "Members of Parliament (MPs), who have been holding emotional meetings with constituents and searching their souls, are due to debate the issue that crosses political lines.",
      "Supporters say the law would provide dignity to the dying and prevent unnecessary suffering. Opponents say it would put vulnerable people at risk, fearing that some would be coerced to end their lives and that some elderly or disabled people may opt for death so they don't become a burden.",
      "A vote in favor of the bill would send it to another round of hearings. A vote against it would kill it.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill and the next steps:",
      "The House of Commons hasn't debated an assisted dying bill since 2015 when a similar measure failed.",
      "Debate is scheduled for five hours and more than 150 members have reportedly signed up to speak. It is expected to be followed by a close vote.",
      "Although the current bill was proposed by a member of the ruling center-left Labour Party, it is an open vote with no pressure from the government on supporting it.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has previously supported assisted dying, said the government will remain neutral and he wouldn't reveal how he would vote. Some members of his cabinet have said they will support the bill, while others are against it.",
      "Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown, along with three former Conservative prime ministers \u2014 Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, and Theresa May \u2014 have publicly opposed the bill, though they are no longer in the House of Commons and can't vote. Former Tory Prime Minister David Cameron supports it.",
      "If the bill passes the first stage in the House of Commons, it will face further scrutiny and votes in both Houses of Parliament.",
      "If ultimately approved, any new law is unlikely to come into effect within the next two to three years, supporters say.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, only those over 18 years old in England and Wales and who are expected to die within six months can request assisted dying. They must have the mental capacity to make a choice about the end of their life and will be required to make two separate declarations about their wish to die.",
      "Labour lawmaker Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the bill, said the law has robust safeguards built in and contains \u201cthree layers of scrutiny\u201d \u2014 two independent doctors and a High Court judge will have to sign off on any decision.",
      "Anyone found guilty of pressuring, coercing or dishonestly getting someone to make a declaration that they wish to die will face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "Assisted suicide is currently banned in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Someone who helps a person end their life can be prosecuted and face up to 14 years in prison.",
      "The patient must self-administer the life-ending medication. No doctor or anyone else can give the medication.",
      "No health professional is under any obligation to provide assistance to the patient.",
      "Doctors who do take part would have to be satisfied the person making their declaration to die has done so voluntarily. They also must ensure the person is making an informed choice.",
      "One argument supporting the bill is that wealthy individuals can travel to Switzerland, which allows foreigners to go there to legally end their lives, while others have to face possible prosecution for helping their loves ones to die.",
      "Esther Rantzen, 84, a broadcaster dying of lung cancer, has urged passage of the bill so others don\u2019t have to do what she plans to do by traveling to Switzerland to legally end her life. She urged all 650 MPs to attend the hearing.",
      "\u201cThis is such a vital life and death issue, one that we the public care desperately about,\u201d Rantzen said in a public letter. \u201cIt is only right that as many MPs as possible listen to the arguments for and against, and make up your own minds, according to your own conscience, your personal thoughts and feelings.\u201d",
      "Other countries that have legalized assisted suicide include Australia, Belgium, Canada and parts of the United States, with regulations on who is eligible varying by jurisdiction.",
      "Assisted suicide is different from euthanasia, allowed in the Netherlands and Canada, which involves healthcare practitioners administering a lethal injection at the patient's request in specific circumstances."

      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",
      "The judge said providing access to safe and legal abortion services for underage girls \u201cis significant in light of the massive instances of teenage pregnancies in Zimbabwe, and consequently illegal teen abortions and teenage mortalities.\u201d",
      "The country of 15 million people records about 77,000 unsafe abortions annually, but many others go unreported. Many girls and women die from abortion complications each year, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, UNICEF.",
      "Teen pregnancies are rife in the southern African country because of lax enforcement of laws, cultural and religious practices and widespread poverty that also make it difficult for girls and women to access contraceptives and clinics.",
      "Almost one of every four girls falls pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19, according to figures by the government and UNICEF. One of every three girls is wed before age 18 in the deeply conservative southern African country where girls are usually culturally forced to marry men responsible for their unplanned pregnancies."

Searchers hours later found several climbing-related items believed to belong to the men, but no sign of them, police said.",
      "Search efforts did not resume Tuesday due to deteriorating weather conditions on Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, with heavy rain and snow forecast. Operations were unlikely to begin again until conditions improved, expected to be on Thursday.",
      "Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand's South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Thirteen women from the Philippines have been convicted on human trafficking-related charges for acting as surrogates in Cambodia for a ring selling babies to foreigners for cash.",
      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",

      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation.

      "The capture of the towns is the latest in the push by insurgents led by the salafi jihadi Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, as well as Turkey-backed opposition fighters. Insurgents now are about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from Hama, the country\u2019s fourth-largest city.",

      "WINDHOEK, Namibia -- Namibia elected its first female leader as Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was declared the winner Tuesday of a presidential election last week that was tarnished by technical glitches that caused a three-day extension to allow votes to be cast, and rejected as illegal by opposition parties.",
      "The 72-year-old Nandi-Ndaitwah won with 57% of the vote, defying predictions that she might be forced into a runoff.",
      "Her ruling SWAPO party also retained its parliamentary majority, although by a very thin margin, and extended its 34-year hold on power since the southern African country gained independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990.",
      "Namibia, a sparsely populated country of around 3 million on the southwestern coast of Africa, has a reputation for being one of the continent's more stable democracies and the problems around the election have caused consternation.",
      "Last Wednesday's vote was marred by shortages of ballot papers and other problems that led election officials to extend voting until Saturday. Opposition parties have said the extension is unconstitutional, and some have pledged to join together in a legal appeal to have the election invalidated.",
      "The Electoral Commission of Namibia, which ran the election, rejected opposition calls for a redo of the vote.",
      "It has undermined Nandi-Ndaitwah's place in history. She is set to become her country's fifth president since independence and a rare female leader in Africa. She was a member of Namibia's underground independence movement in the 1970s and received part of her higher education in the then-Soviet Union.",
      "She was promoted to vice president in February after President Hage Geingob died while in office. Nangolo Mbumba, who became president after Geingob's death, didn't run in the election.",
      "The ruling SWAPO party won 51 seats in the parliamentary vote, only just passing the 49 it needed to keep its majority and narrowly avoiding becoming another long-ruling party to be rejected in southern Africa this year. It was SWAPO's worst parliamentary election result.",

      "South Africa's African National Congress, which freed the country from the racist system of apartheid, lost its 30-year majority in an election in May and had to form a coalition. Botswana's ruling party was stunningly removed in a landslide in October after governing for 58 years since independence from Britain.",
      "Mozambique's long-ruling Frelimo has been accused of rigging an October election and has faced weeks of violent protests against its rule.",
      "SWAPO faced similar challenges as those countries, with frustration at high unemployment and economic hardship, especially among young people, driving a desire for era-ending change.",
      "In a brief speech after the results were announced late Tuesday night, Nandi-Ndaitwah said Namibians had voted for peace, stability and youth empowerment.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do what we promised you during the campaigns. Thank you for your confidence and trust in us,\" she said. Nandi-Ndaitwah was also due to address the nation on Wednesday morning.",
      "\u201cSWAPO Wins. Netumbo Wins. Namibia Wins. Now Hard Work,\u201d the ruling party posted on its official account on social media site X.",
      "Some opposition parties boycotted the announcement by the Electoral Commission of Namibia at its results center in the capital, Windhoek. The commission has been roundly criticized for its running of the vote, with many angry Namibians complaining they had to wait hours and sometimes over multiple days for the chance to vote.",
      "Just over 1 million votes were cast out of 1.4 million registered voters, according to the electoral commission.",
      "Panduleni Itula, the leading opposition candidate from the Independent Patriots for Change party, was second in the presidential election with 25% of the vote. His party won the second-largest number of seats in Parliament behind SWAPO.",
      "Itula and his party have led the criticism of the vote and said they will lodge their appeal against the election this week. Other opposition parties said they will join that legal challenge.",
      "Itula has said that thousands of voters may have been prevented from voting as only some polling stations allowed an extension. \"This election has violated the very tenets of our Electoral Act. Namibians deserve the right to choose their leaders freely and fairly, not through a rigged process,\u201d he said.",
      "Namibia is a former German colony that came under South African control after World War I and its Black majority was later subjected to some of South Africa\u2019s apartheid policies. SWAPO was at the forefront of the battle for independence from South Africa.",

      "South Korea\u2019s President Yoon Suk Yeol is facing parliamentary moves to impeach him after he sent heavily armed forces into Seoul\u2019s streets with his baffling and sudden declaration of martial law that harkened to past dictatorships",
      "TOKYO -- South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol faced parliamentary moves to impeach him after he sent heavily armed forces into Seoul's streets with his baffling and sudden declaration of martial law that harkened to the country\u2019s past dictatorships.",
      "Opposition parties submitted the impeachment motion just hours after parliament unanimously voted to cancel Yoon's declaration, forcing him to lift martial law about six hours after it began. Impeaching Yoon requires the support of two-thirds of the National Assembly and at least six of the nine Constitutional Court justices. The liberal opposition Democratic Party holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament and has called for Yoon's resignation.",
      "A vote on the impeachment motion could be held as early as Friday, Democratic Party lawmaker Kim Yong-min said.",
      "During the tense hours under martial law, heavily armed forces surrounded the parliament, backed by army helicopters and armored vehicles. Lawmakers climbed walls to get into the building and held off troops by activating fire extinguishers. Politician and former news anchor Ahn Gwi-ryeong tried to pull an assault rifle away from a soldier who had pointed it at her chest as she shouted: \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed of yourselves?\u201d",
      "The lawmakers who managed to reenter the building rejected Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration 190-0, including 18 lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s party, forcing Yoon to rescind it at a hastily assembled Cabinet meeting.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the situation in South Korea:",
      "Yoon ordered martial law without warning in a speech late Tuesday where he vowed to eliminate \u201canti-state\u201d forces he said were plotting rebellion and accused the main opposition parties of supporting the country\u2019s rival, North Korea.",
      "Yoon gave no direct evidence when he raised the specter of North Korea as a destabilizing force. Yoon has long maintained that a hard line against the North is the only way to stop Pyongyang from following through on its nuclear threats against Seoul.",
      "Until the late 1980s, South Korea had a series of strongmen who repeatedly invoked North Korea when struggling to control domestic dissidents and political opponents.",
      "Yoon has struggled to get his agenda through an opposition-dominated parliament while facing corruption scandals involving him and his wife.",
      "South Korea\u2019s constitution gives the president power to use the military to keep order in \u201cwartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states.\" That can include suspending civil rights like the freedom of the press and assembly, and temporarily limiting the powers of the courts and government agencies.",
      "But it also gives the National Assembly power to lift the declaration with a majority vote.",
      "Some experts say the way Yoon imposed martial law went far beyond his legitimate powers. While it comes with far-reaching powers, the constitution doesn't allow a president to use the military to suspend parliament. Many also question whether the country really faces a situation comparable to war.",
      "The opposition lambasted Yoon's actions as undemocratic. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon\u2019s announcement \u201cillegal and unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The sudden declaration was also opposed by the leader of Yoon's own conservative party, Han Dong-hoon, who called the decision wrong and vowed to \u201cstop it with the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe people will block the president\u2019s anti-constitutional step. The military must be on the side of the public in any case. Let\u2019s resolutely oppose it,\u201d Kim Dong Yeon, the opposition party governor of Gyeonggi province, which surrounds Seoul, wrote on X.",
      "Average South Koreans were in shock. Social media was flooded with messages expressing surprise and worry over Yoon\u2019s announcement.",
      "There were quick claims that the emergency declaration was linked to Yoon\u2019s political struggles.",
      "He has had little success in getting his policies adopted by a parliament that has been controlled by the opposition since he took over in 2022.",
      "Conservatives have said the opposition moves are political revenge for investigations into Lee, who is seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027.",
      "Just this month, Yoon denied wrongdoing in an influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife. The claims have battered his approval ratings and fueled attacks by his rivals.",
      "The scandal centers on claims that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative ruling People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president.",
      "Yoon has said he did nothing inappropriate.",
      "South Korea became a democracy only in the late 1980s, and military intervention in civilian affairs is still a touchy subject.",
      "During the dictatorships that emerged as the country rebuilt from the 1950-53 Korean War, leaders occasionally proclaimed martial law that allowed them to station combat soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or in public places to prevent anti-government demonstrations.",
      "Such scenes are unimaginable for many today.",
      "Dictator Park Chung-hee, who ruled South Korea for nearly 20 years before he was assassinated by his spy chief in 1979, led several thousand troops into Seoul in the early hours of May 16, 1961, in the country\u2019s first coup. He proclaimed martial law several times to stop protests and jail critics.",
      "Less than two months after Park\u2019s death, Maj. Gen. Chun Doo-hwan led tanks and troops into Seoul in December 1979 in the country\u2019s second coup. The next year, he orchestrated a brutal military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Gwangju, killing at least 200 people.",
      "In the summer of 1987, massive street protests forced Chun\u2019s government to accept direct presidential elections. His army buddy Roh Tae-woo, who had joined Chun\u2019s 1979 coup, won the election held later in 1987 thanks largely to divided votes among liberal opposition candidates.",

      "The offensive is being led by HTS as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates.",
      "The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years.",
      "Elsewhere, Syria said its counteroffensive pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgents said they captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles.",
      "Syrian state media SANA on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into the city as they did over the weekend into Aleppo.",
      "A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near the city of Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria\u2019s civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He has worked for dpa since 2017.",
      "The insurgency through its Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app said they captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed.",
      "If the insurgents seize Hama city and control the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite community and a strategic Russian naval base.",
      "Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIf we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,\" Pedersen said in an address to the U.N. Security Council. \"Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction.\"",
      "About three thousand displaced people from the Hama countryside and Aleppo made their way to the city of Homs, with many more on the way. Those who arrived and found shelter in schools told The Associated Press that they spent hours in traffic, many struggling to afford surging prices of petrol.",
      "Nidal Assaf, 38, fled the northern Hama countryside where the insurgency took over several towns and villages. Speaking from a school-turned-shelter in Homs, he said the residents and army couldn't handle the fighters, and had to flee amid the fighting with his family and tens of relatives.",
      "\u201cWe tried to resist both civilians and military, and then people eventually had to flee,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was very difficult to reach our destination because of the strikes and the traffic.\u201d",
      "Near Assaf was Youssef Choueib, who fled Aleppo to Homs for the third time since 2011: first when rebels last took the city, and then after a massive earthquake in 2023 rattled northern Syria and Turkey. Choueib said he has family stuck in Aleppo. \u201cThey called me many times, but they said they couldn\u2019t leave,\u201d Choueib told the AP. \u201cThey tell me there is no bread. There is no food at all.\u201d",
      "Turkey, which backs Syria's opposition, has called on Assad to reconcile with opposition forces and include them in any political solution to end the conflict.",
      "Ankara has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey\u2019s withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries.",
      "Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist.",
      "Turkish and Iranian officials met earlier this week, in a bid to reach a solution to de-escalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria who once backed groups that tried to overthrow Assad, have expressed their concern of the conflict's regional impacts, and have backed the president."

      "Presidential front-runner and far-right populist Calin Georgescu says Romania\u2019s Western alliances remain secure providing they \u201cserve the sovereignty of the country and nothing else.\u201d",
      "IZVORANI, Romania -- Sitting at his desk in an isolated compound north of Bucharest, presidential front-runner and far-right populist Calin Georgescu says Romania\u2019s Western alliances remain secure providing they \u201cserve the sovereignty of the country and nothing else.\u201d",
      "Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round of the Romanian presidential vote on Nov. 24, despite being a huge outsider, plunging the European Union and NATO country into unprecedented turmoil. On Sunday, he will face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a final vote.",
      "\u201cI am interested in us being a sovereign and self-sufficient power,\u201d the 62-year-old independent candidate told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cFreedom and independence come from the ability to finance yourself, not from being financed by others.\u201d",
      "His vision for his country\u2019s future lies in a series of Romania-first policies in a push to become self-reliant in areas such as energy, food, and water.",
      "Other key issues he wants to address if he wins the presidency, he said, span tackling high poverty rates, organized crime, and drug use in schools. \u201cOur children are dying from drug use,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s unimaginable.\u201d",
      "Georgescu is also a self-professed Donald Trump supporter and says the incoming U.S. president \u201cknows what he wants, he loves his people, he put America first, just like I put Romania first ... we have the same ideology.\u201d",
      "His success has left Western allies on edge. In the past, Georgescu \u2014 who declared zero campaign spending \u2014 praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d and called Ukraine \u201can invented state.\u201d Still, he claims not to be pro-Russian.",
      "He has also courted controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. He denies having any connection to extremist organizations and says the quotes were miss represented.",
      "\u201cI am only for God and my country,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d",
      "Once a member of Romania\u2019s far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being accused by colleagues of being Russia-friendly and critical of NATO.",
      "Romania has played a key role in the U.S.-led military alliance since Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine nearly three years ago. Observers wonder how a Georgescu presidency could affect NATO unity.",
      "\u201cNATO is a defensive organization, but as long as it remains defensive, everything is fine,\u201d the presidential hopeful said. \u201cWe will evaluate and see what is to Romania\u2019s advantage \u2026 Everything, no matter what, must benefit the Romanian people,\" referring to two NATO bases in Romania.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, \u201cit\u2019s a very difficult and grave situation,\" he said. \"And my main position is a strategy of peace. Peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.\u201d",
      "But Lasconi, his opponent in Sunday\u2019s runoff, has cast Georgescu as a threat to democracy and national security who is not fit for high office.",
      "\u201cLet us be very clear, Calin Georgescu is an open admirer of Vladimir Putin. He is openly against NATO and the European Union,\u201d she said a day after the first vote. \u201cHe is for Romania\u2019s isolation, which he calls neutrality.\" She also added that \"without NATO we are at the mercy of Russia.\u201d",
      "His past controversial remarks are wide-ranging and often veer in conspiracy, like his questioning of vaccine safety or calling climate change a \u201cbusiness scam,\u201d or that \u201cfeminism is an absolute mess.\u201d",
      "Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania\u2019s environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program.",
      "But he remained a little-known entity until just weeks ago.",
      "Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 531,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while Romania\u2019s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates.",
      "Asked whether he believes the Chinese-owned platform TikTok can pose a threat to democracy, he said: \u201cThe most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media.\u201d",
      "In his downtime, he says he enjoys listening to classical composers, such as 19th-century composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and is a big fan of the Irish singer Enya. He holds black belts in judo and karate and said he would make sports investment a top priority \u201cbecause otherwise, you can\u2019t have a healthy nation.\u201d",
      "Romania\u2019s political class, he said, has \u201cconstantly shown an inferiority complex\u201d toward the West and vowed to change the dynamic.",
      "\u201cEverything I do and will do will be from a negotiation standpoint, in the sense that Romania will stand tall and not on its knees,\u201d he said."

      "Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral has some surprising stories to tell before it reopens this weekend after five years of restoration",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Notre Dame Cathedral, which is set to reopen to the public on Sunday after a five-year restoration following a devastating fire, stands as a jewel of Gothic architecture, a symbol of Paris and a tourist mecca.",
      "But behind the grandeur of the cathedral, which took 182 years to build between the 12th and 14th centuries, lie some surprising stories. From medieval myths to modern-day mysteries, here are five special things to know about this Paris landmark:",
      "Notre Dame\u2019s importance goes beyond its architecture and history \u2014 it\u2019s literally the point from which all roads in France begin.",
      "In front of the cathedral, embedded in the cobblestones, lies a modest bronze-and-stone slab with the inscription \u201cpoint z\u00e9ro des routes de France,\u201d meaning \u201cstarting point of the roads of France.'' This plaque marks the starting point for measuring distances between Paris and other cities across the country.",
      "While the plaque was installed in 1924, the idea of a national \u201cground zero\u201d dates to 1769. King Louis XV envisioned a central reference for France\u2019s growing network of roads, a concept that tied the nation\u2019s geography to its heart in Paris.",
      "Those scary stone creatures on Notre Dame might seem ancient, but not all of them are what they appear. The actual gargoyles, which are monster-shaped gutters used to drain rainwater, have been around since the time of the cathedral\u2019s construction. But the dramatic, monster-like figures often depicted on postcards and movies are chimera, and they\u2019re much newer.",
      "In the 19th century, the architect Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, who was in charge of renovating the then-decaying building, added these creatures to add to the mystique of the cathedral. Viollet-le-Duc drew inspiration from Victor Hugo\u2019s famous book \u2018\u2019The Hunchback of Notre Dame'' to create these demonic animal figures with personified expressions.",
      "How to tell them apart? Gargoyles resemble horizontal spikes coming out of the facade and have holes in their spouts to allow water to drain.",
      "During the French Revolution, which saw waves of protest against the Church, Notre Dame wasn\u2019t exactly treated like a revered cathedral. In 1793, revolutionaries stripped it of its religious symbols and renamed it \u201cNotre-Dame de la Raison\u201d (Our Lady of Reason).",
      "Instead, the cathedral hosted festivals celebrating science and Enlightenment ideas, and for a short time, it was even used as a wine warehouse.",
      "Religious services resumed in 1795, and Notre Dame regained its sacred status on the impulse of French emperor Napoleon I, who held his coronation there in 1804, immortalized in a famous painting by Jacques-Louis David.",
      "In 1792, revolutionaries also decapitated 28 statues from Notre Dame\u2019s facade, mistaking them for French monarchs. They were actually ancient kings of Judah, biblical ancestors of Jesus. The heads were thought lost forever, possibly destroyed or sold as building materials.",
      "But in 1977, workers renovating a courtyard in Paris\u2019 9th arrondissement uncovered hundreds of fragments of stone sculptures. Experts confirmed they were the missing heads of Notre Dame\u2019s kings. How they ended up buried there remains a mystery.",
      "Today, 22 of the heads have been restored and are displayed at the Cluny Museum in Paris. Their discovery is considered one of the most remarkable archaeological finds in the city\u2019s modern history.",
      "The 2019 fire that almost destroyed Notre Dame revealed a serious health risk. When the flames melted the roof, tons of toxic lead dust were released into the air and settled across Paris.",
      "The problem? Authorities discovered there were no rules to measure the danger of outdoor lead dust. This wasn\u2019t just a Paris issue \u2014 major cities like London and Rome, and even the World Health Organization, don\u2019t have guidelines for outdoor lead pollution.",
      "The Notre Dame fire highlighted a hidden problem, forcing officials to take a closer look at their safety standards. It took four months for the city to complete a deep-clean operation of the sidewalks even as tourists, residents and merchants walked streets around the cathedral daily.",

Thailand has a vast fishing fleet but it is largely crewed by men from poorer neighboring countries.",

      "The statement, read by Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, spokesperson of Myanmar\u2019s military government, confirmed that 27 Myanmar nationals and four Thai nationals, all men, were safe in captivity.",

      "Bangladeshi media reported one of six fishermen on the boat was injured by gunfire, but Myanmar\u2019s state-run media said there was no navy vessel in the area on the day of the incident."

    "story": [
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is leading a fresh push for European countries to ramp up defense spending",
      "BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte led a fresh push Wednesday for European countries to ramp up defense spending, a budget shortfall that President-elect Donald Trump used to berate U.S. allies during his first term in office, severely damaging trust.",
      "After Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula a decade ago, NATO leaders agreed to halt the defense cuts that began when the Cold War ended and move toward spending 2% of GDP on their military budgets.",
      "Since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago, the leaders have agreed that the 2% target should be the floor rather than the ceiling for defense spending. On average, U.S. allies combined meet that figure, but around a third of the members still do not individually.",
      "Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, threatened not to defend \u201cdelinquent\u201d countries. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any member must be considered an attack on them all. Trump\u2019s remarks undermined confidence that the U.S. could be counted on in a crisis.",
      "\u201cIf you want to keep the deterrence at the present level, 2% is not enough,\u201d Rutte told reporters after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. \u201cWe can now defend ourselves and nobody should try to attack us. But I want that to stay the same in 4 or 5 years.\u201d",
      "In July, U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts endorsed the biggest shakeup of the way the military alliance would respond to any attack on its territory by Russia since the Cold War. It was meant to deter Moscow from targeting any of the 32 allies.",
      "Under highly secret new plans, NATO intends to have up to 300,000 troops ready to move to its eastern flank within 30 days. The plans lay out which allies would respond to an attack anywhere from the Arctic and Baltic Sea region through the Atlantic and east to the Black Sea.",
      "But senior NATO officials concede that countries might have to spend up to 3% of GDP to execute the security blueprint successfully. A new spending target is likely to be announced next year. Rutte also said NATO might set specific targets for member countries to fill military equipment gaps.",
      "U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy insisted that \u201cthe time to act is now.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in very dangerous times,\u201d he said, singling out Russia and its role in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, on top of its war on Ukraine. \u201cWe urge all allies across the NATO family to get serious about defense spending.\u201d",
      "On his last visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cthis is a time for every ally to lean in, not lean back.\u201d The United States is by far the organization's most powerful member country.",
      "\u201cA stronger NATO means more capabilities to deter aggression, more effective allies to meet more complex challenges, and the peace and stability that allows our people to pursue fuller lives,\u201d Blinken said.",
      "Rutte also underlined the importance of expanding Europe\u2019s defense industry, with incentives to drive companies to set up more production lines and hire more workers to staff them, as Western support for Ukraine drains armament stocks.",
      "\u201cWe are producing not enough at too high prices, and the delivery is too slow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation where we just pay more for the same, and we see large kickbacks to the shareholders.\u201d",
      "Rutte urged the allies \u201cto work closely together to make sure that we produce at a much higher rate and acceptable prices.\u201d He noted \u201ca number of countries who are now buying South Korean (equipment) because our own defense companies are not producing at a rate we need.\u201d"

If the motion succeeds, it would mark the first time a French government has been toppled this way in more than 60 years.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron insisted he will serve the rest of his term until 2027 despite growing opposition calls for his departure amid the turmoil.

      "The no-confidence motion rose from fierce opposition to Barnier\u2019s proposed budget.",
      "The National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron\u2019s centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, are uniting against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens\u2019 needs.",
      "Barnier, a conservative appointed in September, could become the country's shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern Republic.",
      "In last-minute efforts to try to save his government, Barnier called on lawmakers to act with \u201cresponsibility\u201d and think of \u201cthe country's best interest.\"",
      "\u201cThe situation is very difficult economically, socially, fiscally and financially,\" he said, speaking on national television TF1 and France 2 on Tuesday evening. \"If the no-confidence motion passes, everything will be more difficult and everything will be more serious.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday morning, National Rally leader Jordan Bardella \u2014 whose party's goodwill was crucial to keeping Barnier in power \u2014 confirmed support for the motion, calling the budget \u201cflawed and harmful\" to the French people. Left-wing leaders have echoed similar criticisms, demanding more robust social spending.",
      "The National Assembly said the no-confidence motion requires at least 288 of 574 votes to pass. The left and the far right count over 330 lawmakers \u2014 yet some may abstain from voting.",
      "If Barnier\u2019s government falls, Macron must appoint a new prime minister, but the fragmented parliament remains unchanged. No new legislative elections can be held until at least July, creating a potential stalemate for policymakers.",
      "While France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets. Barnier warned last week of \u201c a big storm and very serious turbulence on the financial markets,\u201d if his Cabinet was to be toppled.",
      "France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country\u2019s deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further.",

      "TBILISI, Georgia -- Georgian police on Wednesday raided the offices of an opposition party and arrested its leader in an apparent attempt to squelch a wave of mass protests triggered by the governing party\u2019s decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union.",
      "During the past six nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital\u2019s central boulevard. More than 300 protesters have been detained since Thursday and over 100 people have been treated for injuries.",
      "On Wednesday, the Coalition for Change opposition party said that police raided its offices and detained its leader, Nika Gvaramia. It shared a video showing several officers dragging Gvaramia into a car.",
      "Georgian media reported that police also raided the offices of several other opposition groups and non-government organizations.",
      "Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the Georgian Dream party said the raids targeted those who encouraged violence during protests in an attempt to topple his government. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call this repression; it is more of a preventive measure than repression,\u201d he said.",
      "The ruling Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia\u2019s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia\u2019s help and boycotted parliament sessions.",
      "Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party\u2019s decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold.",
      "Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election.",
      "Zourabichvili urged the country's Western partners to respond to Wednesday's wave of police raids of opposition groups by putting \u201cstrong pressure on a ruling party that is driving the country over the cliff!\u201d \u201cDo not be late!\u201d she wrote on social platform X.",
      "The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc\u2019s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a \u201cforeign influence\u201d law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cpursuing the interest of a foreign power,\u201d similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.",
      "The Georgian government\u2019s announcement of the EU accession talks\u2019 suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October\u2019s election as neither free nor fair.",
      "On Monday, the EU reiterated its \u201cserious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.\u201d",
      "Kobakhidze said Tuesday that his government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its \u201cblackmail.\u201d"

      "Toomaj Salehi spent a little over a year in jail and faced a death sentence issued by a Revolutionary Court, which usually involves closed-door hearings and gives limited rights to those on trial. The sentencing drew international criticism and was overturned in June.",

      "Commenting on his release, New York-based Artist At Risk Connection, an organization that protects artists and cultural workers who are at risk because of their creative expression, said in a statement: \u201cThis case highlights the grave risks artists face when challenging authoritarian regimes, as well as ARC\u2019s ongoing efforts to advocate for their rights.\u201d",
      "The Grammy winner was detained for the first time in 2022 following mass protests that swept the Islamic Republic after Amini was arrested for wearing her hijab, the Islamic head covering, too loosely, and later died in police custody.",

      "He spent time in and out of jail and said in a video message that he was tortured during detention, which led to his arrest in Nov. 2023. State media at the time released a video showing him blindfolded and apologizing for his words, a statement likely to have been made under duress.",
      "UN investigators say Iran was responsible for Amini\u2019s death, and that it violently put down largely peaceful protests, killing more than 500 people and detaining over 22,000.",
      "Iran has long prosecuted and in many cases imprisoned dissidents, journalists and artists who challenged government decisions imposing restrictions on women and activists. Reportedly, such cases have dropped after pro-reform President Masoud Pezeshkian came to power in July."

      "A British chef\u2019s appeal for thieves to return 2,500 pies that were in a stolen van has ended in disappointment",
      "LONDON -- A British chef's appeal for thieves to return 2,500 pies that were in a stolen van ended in disappointment Tuesday when police found the vehicle abandoned, with its savory cargo too damaged to eat.",
      "Tommy Banks, who owns two Michelin-starred restaurants and a pub in the northern English county of Yorkshire, said a member of staff discovered the van was missing, along with its cargo of steak and ale, turkey and butternut squash pies intended for a Christmas market in the city of York. The food has been valued at 25,000 pounds ($32,000).",
      "Banks said the van was insured, but he implored the vehicle thieves not to let the food go to waste. In an Instagram video, he suggested they \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and drop the pies at a community center or other venue.",
      "In an update, Banks said police had found the van, badly damaged and with stolen license plates, in Middlesbrough, about 30 miles (50 km) from where it was taken. He said the pies were still inside but were damaged and would have to be discarded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so much waste. It\u2019s just rubbish,\u201d Banks said in a video on Instagram. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s not a happier ending to this story.\u201d",
      "The pie heist is the latest theft of artisanal edibles to rock the U.K. food trade. In October, nearly 1,000 wheels of cloth-wrapped artisanal cheddar weighing 22 metric tons (48,488 pounds) and valued at 300,000 pounds ($390,000) were swiped from London\u2019s Neal\u2019s Yard Dairy by a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor for a major French retailer.",
      "Despite a hunt by British and international police \u2014 and an appeal by TV chef Jamie Oliver \u2014 the cheese has not been found. A 63-year-old man was arrested and questioned by police, but has not been charged."

      "He used military force to put down student-led demonstrations in Gwangju, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of Seoul, killing hundreds of protesters.",
      "In Seoul, thousands of university students took to the streets to demand an end to martial law, and were confronted by riot police using tear gas. Martial law was eventually lifted in 1981.",
      "Martial law was first used in 1948 by South Korea's first president Syngman Rhee as he cracked down on communist uprisings, killing thousands.",
      "It was also invoked during the 1950-53 Korean War to allow South Korea to use its military to stifle anti-government protests.",
      "As Rhee struggled to hold onto power in the face of growing opposition, he imposed martial law again in 1960. Hundreds were killed in clashes between protesters and police. After Rhee was forced to resign in the face of nationwide demonstrations, jubilant South Koreans climbed aboard a tank outside Seoul's City Hall to celebrate.",
      "While still president in 1972, Park Chung-hee initiated another coup to give himself dictatorial powers and declared martial law, again sending tanks into the streets of Seoul. It was lifted later the same year.",
      "Through the years until his assassination in 1979, protests against Park's rule grew, and he used emergency measures to justify the jailing of hundreds of dissidents."

None won an outright majority.",

      "Openings rose 5% to 7.7 million from 7.4 million in September, the Labor Department said Tuesday. The increase suggests that job gains could pick up in the coming months. Still, the latest figure is down significantly from 8.7 million job postings a year ago.",

      "The number of people quitting their jobs rose in October, a sign of confidence in the job market. And layoffs tumbled to just 1.6 million \u2014 below the lowest figures in the two decades that preceded the 2020 pandemic.",
      "Taken as a whole, Tuesday's figures suggest that the job market might be stabilizing at a modest level, with hiring moderate but layoffs uncommonly low. The unemployment rate is at a low 4.1%, even though job gains slowed sharply in October, according to the monthly jobs report. The slowdown in job growth last month reflected mainly the impact of hurricanes and a strike at Boeing.",
      "\u201cThere's a lot of cause for optimism,\" said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed, the job listings website. \"The fact that job openings ticked up is always an encouraging sign.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's figures mean there are now 1.1 available jobs for each unemployed worker, a healthy figure. Before the pandemic there were usually more unemployed people than openings.",
      "Still, the latest ratio is down from a peak of roughly two job openings per unemployed person two years ago. Businesses have pulled back from the hiring frenzy that occurred as the economy emerged from the pandemic recession.",
      "Tuesday's report, known as the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, showed that overall hiring slowed in October. Total hiring slipped to 5.3 million from 5.6 million, though that decline reflected hurricane-related disruptions.",
      "The JOLTS report is separate from the monthly jobs figures, which will be released Friday. That report is forecast to show a net gain of nearly 210,000 jobs in November, up from an anemic 12,000 in October.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report also showed that the number of Americans who quit their jobs rebounded in October to 3.4 million, after having reached a four-year low in September. An increase in quitting is a good sign for the economy, because it suggests that people are confident enough to search for new job opportunities.",
      "The Federal Reserve is watching the jobs data closely. Any sign that hiring is sharply weakening could encourage Fed officials to cut their key interest rate more quickly, to try to bolster borrowing and spending and support the economy."

But not anymore. Africa is the future.\u201d",
      "Biden used the third and final day of his visit to Angola to showcase the Lobito Corridor railway, where the U.S. and allies are investing heavily to refurbish 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) of train lines in Zambia, Congo and Angola.",
      "The project aims to advance the U.S. presence in a region rich in cobalt, copper and other critical minerals used in batteries for electric vehicles, electronic devices and clean energy technologies. By the end of the decade, the rail line could even go a long way toward linking southern Africa's west and east coasts.",

Cargo that once took 45 days to get to the United States \u2014 usually involving trucks to South Africa \u2014 will now take less than 45 hours, he said.

The U.S. is looking to replicate the Lobito Corridor project in other parts of the world, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to offer details that hadn't yet been made public.",

The Biden White House says Republicans in Congress have supported past efforts to promote African business interests through targeted investments and that such initiatives have appealed to Trump and his key advisers in the past.",

      "Alexander Mashinsky, 58, of Manhattan, entered the plea in New York federal court to commodities and securities fraud.",
      "He admitted illegally manipulating the price of Celsius\u2019s proprietary crypto token while secretly selling his own tokens at inflated prices to pocket about $48 million before Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.",
      "In court, he admitted that in 2021 he publicly suggested there was regulatory consent for the company's moves because he knew that customers \u201cwould find false comfort\u201d with that.",
      "And he said that in 2019, he was selling the crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not. He said he knew customers would draw false comfort from that too.",
      "\u201cI accept full responsibility for my actions,\u201d Mashinsky said of crimes that stretched from 2018 to 2022 as the company pitched itself to customers as a modern-day bank where they could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest.",

      "He said Mashinsky used catchy slogans like \u201cUnbank Yourself\u201d to entice prospective customers with a pledge that their money would be as safe in crypto accounts as money would be in a bank. Meanwhile, prosecutors said, Mashinsky and co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund market purchases of the Celsius token to prop up its value.",

      "Celsius employees from multiple departments who noticed false and misleading statements in the sessions warned Mashinsky, but they were ignored, the indictment said.",
      "A plea agreement Mashinsky made with prosecutors calls for him to be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and to forfeit over $48 million, which is the amount of money he allegedly made by selling his company's token.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 8."

      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico announced Wednesday that it will increase its still strikingly low daily minimum wage by 12% next year.",
      "But because the Mexican peso has dropped by 18% in value over the last year, the increase actually marks a slight drop in constant dollar terms.",
      "The three-party minimum wage commission, made up of government, labor and business representatives, announced the increase Wednesday. It will take effect starting Jan. 1 2025.",
      "The new daily minimum wage will be about 279 pesos, or about $13.75. The 2024 wage of 249 pesos per day was worth $14.25 when it was announced in December 2023, but in that time the peso has dropped in value against the U.S. dollar, from 17.20 then to around 20.30 now.",
      "Domestic inflation in Mexico is currently running around 4.75%, so Wednesday's announcement could work out to a real-term increase of about 7%, unless inflation heats up.",
      "That is still only about $1.71 per hour, compared to a U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. However, many U.S. states have minimum wage rates that range from $10 to $16 per hour.",
      "Because living costs are higher along Mexico's northern border with the United States, the official minimum wage is higher there. For 2025, it will be set at around 420 pesos, or $20.70 per day.",

      "Unless you happen to be an average-size person with perfectly balanced proportions, the clothing you buy may or may not fit perfectly. A skilled tailor can make a wardrobe seem almost custom-made by taking up a hem, adjusting a cuff, or making a few nips and tucks here and there.",
      "The same applies to your portfolio. A standard asset-allocation mix (such as a\u202f model portfolio ) may work well for the \u201caverage\u201d investor, but one size doesn\u2019t always fit all.",
      "Here are some of the situations in which you might want to consider adjusting your portfolio for a better fit.",
      "The \u201cbucket approach\u201d is a great way to tailor your asset allocation to better fit your specific needs.",
      "The general idea is to keep one to two years\u2019 worth of expenses in highly liquid securities to help meet short-term cash needs (plus an additional five years\u2019 or more worth of living expenses in high-quality fixed-income securities to provide income and stability). That way you won\u2019t have to scramble to sell securities to meet your ongoing expenses. In effect, this approach is a way of building a tailored asset allocation from the bottom up.",
      "Similarly, make sure your asset allocation accounts for both longer- and shorter-term goals.",
      "If you have upcoming events on the horizon such as a home purchase, college tuition, a wedding, or a big vacation, make sure you have enough of your portfolio in moderate-risk assets (such as high-quality short- or intermediate-term bond funds ) to fund these goals.",
      "It\u2019s far more likely for a single stock to have large losses than a diversified mutual fund, so it\u2019s wise to\u202f prune any stock holdings \u202fso they make up less than 10% of your portfolio. If you\u2019ve received significant\u202fequity awards\u202fas part of your total compensation, though, consider how to do so without realizing hefty\u202fcapital gains.",
      "If your spouse is more than five years older or younger than you, your portfolios should probably look a bit different.",
      "The younger spouse can afford to have a higher equity weighting and a more aggressive risk profile, while the older one will want to dial back risk. If you hold assets jointly, consider using a blended approach based on the average of your two ages.",
      "If you\u2019re fortunate enough to have relatives who lived into their 90s or beyond, it makes sense to plan for a longer-than-usual life expectancy.",
      "You can probably afford to take on more risk with more exposure to equities and high-risk assets. From an actuarial perspective, each year you live means your life expectancy gets longer. Some experts (such as Michael Kitces and Wade Pfau) even argue for a \u201c reverse glide path,\u201d which increases equity exposure as you get older instead of the reverse.",
      "On the flip side, if you\u2019re dealing with a terminal illness, make sure to keep your portfolio conservative enough to meet higher-than-expected\u202f health care expenses \u202fand provide yourself with whatever you might need to make your remaining months and years a little more comfortable.",
      "You might want to leave a\u202f legacy \u202fto your children and grandchildren, but keep in mind that the gift of your time\u2014not money\u2014will probably be the most meaningful. So, don\u2019t feel guilty about spending down your assets if you find yourself in a situation where you need to.",
      "If you weren\u2019t able to save and invest early in your career, your portfolio balance might be relatively low.",
      "Taking a hard look at your spending is the most important step you can take in this situation. But while it might be tempting to ramp up your equity exposure to try to make up lost ground, it\u2019s more prudent to take the opposite approach because a small portfolio has less room to absorb market losses.",
      "Because a pension is literally a fixed income, it functions like a bond position in a portfolio, so you can afford to increase the equity weighting with your other assets. Social Security works the same way: Your monthly benefits won\u2019t grow beyond a small cost of living increase, but it\u2019s effectively a\u202f bond like income stream.",

      "But even as the trip was meant to counter China's influence on the African continent of over 1.4 billion people by showcasing a U.S. commitment of $3 billion for the Lobito Corridor railway redevelopment linking Zambia, Congo and Angola, China announced its own move.",

Authorities on Tuesday encouraged people downtown to stay home. As the motorcade passed through outer neighborhoods, crowds waved from rooftops or intersections.",
      "Biden and Lourenco briefly addressed reporters before a closed-door meeting. Biden ignored questions about his decision to issue a pardon for his son after previously pledging not to, and joked to the Angolan delegation, \u201cWelcome to America.\u201d",

      "Angola's president said he\u2019d like to see a public-private partnership to increase energy production, and praised Biden\u2019s leadership on the Lobito Corridor, saying it would \u201calways be remembered.\"",
      "After the meeting, a senior U.S. administration official said China didn\u2019t come up. The official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss a meeting that was not public, also said Biden's visit to Lobito will be joined by the presidents of Zambia and Congo.",
      "Biden had promised to visit sub-Saharan Africa last year, after reviving the U.S.-Africa Summit in 2022. But the trip was delayed until this year, reinforcing a sentiment among Africans that their continent is still a low priority for Washington. The last U.S. president to visit sub-Saharan Africa was Barack Obama in 2015.",

      "A judge\u2019s overturning of Wisconsin\u2019s 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 y...",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A judge's overturning of Wisconsin's 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 years ago.",
      "But before unions head back to the bargaining table, more legal fights await. Here are five things to know about the law, the current challenge and what happens next:",
      "At its core, the battle is over whether tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, prison guards and other state government employees can bargain over their workplace conditions and salary.",
      "The law, known as Act 10, was enacted in 2011 and limits bargaining to only wage increases no greater than the inflation rate. That means that other issues, such as benefits, safety and working conditions, and vacations, are not negotiable.",
      "The law also requires every public sector union to vote annually on maintaining its own certification. In order to pass, at least 51% of each union's members must vote yes, not just 51% of those voting.",
      "Union members were also required to pay more for their benefits, which reduced their take home pay and effectively served as a pay cut.",
      "Supporters say the law has saved school districts and local governments billions of dollars. Opponents say the law has kneecapped unions that traditionally back Democrats and hurt workers' morale and income.",
      "Passage of the law helped ease the way for the Legislature in 2015 to approve a so-called right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "Then- Gov. Scott Walker introduced the proposal shortly after taking office in 2011. That sparked weeks of massive protests, a walkout by Democratic state senators in a failed attempt to block passage of the law, and recall elections targeting Walker and Republicans who voted for it.",
      "The fight thrust Wisconsin into the the center of the battle over union rights in the U.S. Walker rode the attention, survived the 2012 recall attempt and then mounted a campaign for president a few years later. He dropped out, though, in the fall of 2015 as Donald Trump's support grew.",
      "The battle lines then and now are largely the same. The law is opposed by Democrats and unions. It is supported by Republicans, conservative groups and powerful organizations like Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Wisconsin.",
      "Numerous legal challenges have been filed challenging the law in state and federal courts. None of them succeeded until now.",
      "The latest challenge was filed last year by seven unions representing teachers and other public-sector workers and three individuals.",
      "This lawsuit alleges that Act 10\u2019s exemption of some police, firefighters and other public safety workers from the bargaining restrictions violates the Wisconsin Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee.",
      "A similar argument was made in a federal lawsuit alleging that Act 10 violated the equal protection guarantee in the U.S. Constitution. But a federal appeals court in 2013 said the state was free to draw a line between public safety and other unions, and the following year again ruled that the law was constitutional.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2014 also upheld the law as constitutional, rejecting a lawsuit brought by teachers and Milwaukee public workers. That case raised different arguments than the current lawsuit. And in 2019, a federal judge rejected a lawsuit brought by two arms of the International Union of Operating Engineers that argued the law violates free speech and free association under the First Amendment.",
      "Walker, whose legacy is largely defined by his fight with the unions, called the ruling \u201cbrazen political activism.\u201d",
      "The judge who struck down the law, Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost, was appointed by Wisconsin's current governor, Democrat Tony Evers. It also appears that Frost signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Republican leaders of the Legislature echoed Walker's comments, decrying the ruling and calling Frost an \u201cactivist.\u201d",
      "Evers called the decision \u201cgreat news\" and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed workers should have a seat at the table in decisions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Unions applauded the ruling while conservative groups warned that undoing the law would dramatically increase costs on local governments, leading to service cuts and tax increases.",
      "The Legislature has appealed the case. That would typically send it to the state court of appeals, unless the unions ask the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly.",
      "Opponents of the law are anxious for the state Supreme Court to get the case while it is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices. An election in April will determine whether liberals maintain control or the court flips back to conservatives, who held sway there from before Act 10 was passed until 2023. The newly elected justice will start work next August.",
      "Even if the current court takes the case, it's unclear what justices would hear it.",
      "Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose win last year gave liberals the majority, said during her campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also said she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against the law and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting the Act 10 law. But during his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court."

    "story": [
      "When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo",
      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 31, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

      "For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion",
      "DETROIT -- For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion.",
      "On Monday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick turned aside a request from Musk's lawyers to reverse a ruling she announced in January that had thrown out the compensation plan. The judge ruled then that Musk effectively controlled Tesla's board and had engineered the outsize pay package during sham negotiations.",
      "Lawyers for a Tesla shareholder who sued to block the pay package contended that shareholders who had voted for the 10-year plan in 2018 had been given misleading and incomplete information.",
      "In their defense, Tesla's board members asserted that the shareholders who ratified the pay plan a second time in June had done so after receiving full disclosures, thereby curing all the problems the judge had cited in her January ruling. As a result, they argued, Musk deserved the pay package for having raised Tesla's market value by billions of dollars.",
      "McCormick rejected that argument. In her 103-page opinion, she ruled that under Delaware law, Tesla's lawyers had no grounds to reverse her January ruling \u201cbased on evidence they created after trial.\u201d",
      "On Monday night, Tesla posted on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that the company will appeal. The appeal would be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, the only state appellate court Tesla can pursue. Experts say a ruling would likely come in less than a year.",
      "\u201cThe ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs' lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners \u2014 the shareholders,\u201d Tesla argued.",
      "Later, on X, Musk unleashed a blistering attack on the judge, asserting that McCormick is \u201ca radical far left activist cosplaying as a judge.\u201d",
      "Legal authorities generally suggest that McCormick\u2019s ruling was sound and followed the law. Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that in his view, McCormick was right to rule that after Tesla lost its case in the original trial, it created improper new evidence by asking shareholders to ratify the pay package a second time.",
      "Had she allowed such a claim, he said, it would cause a major shift in Delaware\u2019s laws against conflicts of interest given the unusually close relationship between Musk and Tesla\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cDelaware protects investors \u2014 that\u2019s what she did,\u201d said Elson, who has followed the court for more than three decades. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a \u2018superstar CEO\u2019 doesn\u2019t put you in a separate category.\u201d",
      "Elson said he thinks investors would be reluctant to put money into Delaware companies if there were exceptions to the law for \u201cspecial people.\u201d",
      "Elson said that in his opinion, the court is likely to uphold McCormick's ruling.",
      "Experts say no. Rulings on state laws are normally left to state courts. Brian Dunn, program director for the Institute of Compensation Studies at Cornell University, said it's been his experience that Tesla has no choice but to stay in the Delaware courts for this compensation package.",
      "The company could try to reconstitute the pay package and seek approval in Texas, where it may expect more friendlier judges. But Dunn, who has spent 40 years as an executive compensation consultant, said it's likely that some other shareholder would challenge the award in Texas because it's excessive compared with other CEOs' pay plans.",
      "\u201cIf they just want to turn around and deliver him $56 billion, I can't believe somebody wouldn't want to litigate it,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt's an unconscionable amount of money.\u201d",
      "Almost certainly. Tesla stock is trading at 15 times the exercise price of stock options in the current package in Delaware, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Tesla's share price has doubled in the past six months, Jonas wrote. At Monday\u2019s closing stock price, the Musk package is now worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, an executive data firm.",
      "And Musk has asked for a subsequent pay package that would give him 25% of Tesla's voting shares. Musk has said he is uncomfortable moving further into artificial intelligence with the company if he doesn't have 25% control. He currently holds about 13% of Tesla's outstanding shares."

      "President Joe Biden, like Trump, also opposes Nippon Steel's purchase of Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. Biden\u2019s White House in September said that it had yet to see a report from the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which was reviewing the transaction for national security concerns.

      "\"This transaction should be approved on its merits. The benefits are overwhelmingly clear. Our communities, customers, investors, and employees strongly support this transaction, and we will continue to advocate for them and adherence to the rule of law,\" U.S. Steel said.",
      "The deal follows a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel, including U.S. Steel. U.S. Steel's shareholders have approved the deal, but the United Steelworkers oppose it.",
      "In a statement Tuesday, the union said the deal carries \u201cserious long-term implications for U.S. economic and national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that President Trump understands the vital role a strong domestic steel industry plays in our national security, as well as the importance of the jobs and communities the industry supports,\" the union said.",
      "The deal has drawn bipartisan opposition in the U.S. Senate, including from the incoming vice president, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, although the federal government's objections to the deal have drawn criticism that the opposition is political.",
      "Some U.S. Steel workers would prefer Nippon Steel acquire the company, given that it appears to have a better financial balance sheet than another potential buyer, Cleveland-Cliffs.",
      "U.S. Steel \u201cprovided a very, very good life for our families for a lot of years,\u201d said Jack Maskil, a vice president at the Steelworkers local branch in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. \u201cAnd we feel that with the Nippon deal that a lot more families for futures to come will be able to share the same.\u201d",

      "The global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end after the popstar performed more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end.",
      "There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift\u2019s decision to put on a 3 \u00bd-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different \u201ceras\u201d of her career \u2014 a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note.",
      "But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy \u2014 a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her.",
      "\u201cRight now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,\u201d said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift\u2019s concerts \u2014 by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s their therapy.\u201d",
      "Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the \u201clivestream queen,\u201d says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar.",
      "Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There\u2019s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine your favorite sports team,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cThey\u2019re still a team, but they\u2019re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That\u2019s going to leave a hole for some folks.\u201d",
      "Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool.",
      "\u201cThis is the very first time I\u2019ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cthis tour has really become my entire life.\u201d Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end.",
      "Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada.",
      "By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, \u201cSpeak Now \u201d and 2014's record \u201c1989,\u201d as well as released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,\u201d said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. \u201cAnd this is a woman that owning it, she\u2019s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women\u2019s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.\"",
      "Even the word \u201cera\u201d has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases \u2014 are you in your \u201cvillain era\u201d or a \u201chealing era\u201d?",
      "\u201cI think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,\u201d said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. \u201cWhether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she\u2019s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she\u2019s achieved a level where it\u2019s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.\u201d",
      "Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer \u2014 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides \u2014 passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.",
      "And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows.",
      "\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\u201d Swift later wrote in a statement. \u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\u201d",
      "Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets \u2014 which also became an iconic feature of the shows \u2014 on a nearby tree.",
      "Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences \u2014 both old and new.",
      "\u201cI feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,\u201d Wong said of Swifties. \u201cNow the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.\u201d"

      "A U.S. Senate panel is taking aim at airlines and their growing use of fees for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "A U.S. Senate panel planned to take aim at airline executives Wednesday for the carriers' growing use of fees for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "The panel\u2019s chairman, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees, which he said raise prices for consumers.",
      "Blumenthal said seat fees are pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to select their own seats.",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",
      "Airline executives bristle at the term \u201cjunk fees,\u201d and argue they are merely giving consumers what they want: choices.",
      "\u201cOur customers who prioritize affordability have the option to choose a lower-fare product and, in doing so, opt out of paying for additional services that they do not want,\u201d Andrew Nocella, the chief commercial officer of United Airlines, said in testimony prepared for the panel's hearing Wednesday. \u201cBut we also have customers who seek more services, and they retain the ability to choose the services they value, for an incremental fee, like a seat with extra legroom or checked bags.\u201d",
      "Nocella agreed with critics who say fees should not come as a surprise to passengers but need to be transparent and described clearly during the ticket-buying process.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American and United leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations reported last week that United, American, Delta, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "The panel was scheduled to hear Wednesday from Nocella, American chief strategy officer Steve Johnson, Delta chief external affairs officer Peter Carter, and the chief commercial officers of Frontier and Spirit.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled. The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The airline industry and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are continuing their fight over fees and other regulations, even after the November election."

      "The poor performance of General Motors\u2019 Chinese joint ventures is forcing the company to write down assets and take a restructuring charge totaling more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter of this year",
      "DETROIT -- The poor performance of General Motors' Chinese joint ventures is forcing the company to write down assets and take a restructuring charge totaling more than $5 billion in the fourth quarter of this year.",
      "The Detroit automaker said in a regulatory filing Wednesday that it will cut the value of its equity stake in the ventures by $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion when it reports its results early next year. In addition, GM will take $2.7 billion worth of restructuring charges, most of it during the fourth quarter.",
      "The noncash charges will reduce the company's net income, but they will not affect adjusted pretax earnings, GM said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "GM for years has owned 50% of its joint venture with SAIC General Motors Corp. and has other joint ventures, including a finance arm. The ventures used to be a reliable source of equity income for the company, but have swung to losses in the past year.",
      "The ventures lost $347 million from January through September, compared with a profit of $353 million in the same period of 2023. Still, GM expects to post a full year net profit of $10.4 billion to $11.1 billion.",
      "China has become an increasingly difficult market for foreign automakers, with BYD and other domestic companies raising their quality and reducing costs. The country also has subsidized domestic automakers.",
      "The main joint venture with SAIC, called SGM, is finishing restructuring actions that GM expects will \u201caddress market challenges and competitive conditions,\u201d GM said in the filing.",
      "Shares of GM fell just over 1% in Wednesday morning trading to $53.06. They are up nearly 47% so far this year.",
      "In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska wrote that he sees two risks to GM's China restructuring plan, that the venture will need \u201cincremental cash\u201d to do the work, and that there may be too many headwinds in China for the venture to become meaningfully profitable.",
      "But he also wrote that the joint venture's current cash balance is likely to be sufficient to cover restructuring expenses, provided the venture becomes profitable next year.",
      "On GM\u2019s third-quarter earnings conference call, Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson said restructuring in China had not yet started, but sales were up and inventory was down.",
      "CEO Mary Barra said China is a difficult environment because some domestic brands \u201cdon\u2019t seem to prioritize profitability, they\u2019re definitely prioritizing production.\u201d She said GM can make money there in a different way, focusing on a new pickup truck and importing premium vehicles.",

      "Talk about taking the road less traveled",
      "A pair of Americans delivered command performances halfway around the world during Thanksgiving week. One was Peter Uihlein, the former U.S. Amateur champion and two-time Walker Cup player, winning by five shots in Qatar on the Asian Tour.",
      "The other was Ryggs Johnston, and well, some introductions might be in order.",
      "Don't get the idea Johnston came out of nowhere when he won the Australian Open \u2014 unless Libby, Montana, and its population of 3,725 is anyone's idea of nowhere. He was named after Mel Gibson's character in \u201cLethal Weapon.\u201d",
      "The best golfer to come out of Montana?",
      "\u201cHands down, Ryggs Johnston,\u201d Jeff Dooley said with a chuckle, because the best humor is often found in truth.",
      "Dooley is the head pro at Cabinet View Golf Club, which has 250 members who buy passes for a seven-month golf season on an 18-hole course overlooking the Cabinet Mountains, just east of Idaho and south of Canada. He watched Johnston develop and knew there was something special about the way he played, the way he scored.",
      "\u201cI've been saying for a long time, it's inevitable we're going to see Ryggs on TV in a tournament,\u201d Dooley said, perhaps not realizing that moment would keep him up past midnight to see Johnston look unflappable in his three-shot win at Kingston Heath.",
      "\u201cEverybody was just wired, all the golf pros,\" Dooley said. \u201cThere was a huge text stream going across Montana.\u201d",
      "The best in Montana at age 24? A case can be made. The most notable tour professional from Montana was Mike Grob, who won six times on the Canadian Tour and spent one full year on the PGA Tour.",
      "Five months into his professional career, in his second start as a European tour member, Johnston won golf's fifth-oldest championship at the Australian Open to get his name on the Stonehaven Cup along with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player, and more recently Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Adam Scott.",
      "The Australian Open also was must-see TV further south in Tempe, Arizona, where Arizona State coach Matt Thurmond was never more proud.",
      "Thurmond heard all about Johnston and tried to recruit him when he was coach at Washington, only to learn about that sixth-grade project when the teacher asked students to write down their dream. Johnston's dream: \u201cGo to ASU and play golf.\u201d",
      "Thurmond was hired at Arizona State in 2016 and getting Johnston became a lot easier.",
      "Johnston never won a tournament in college but always was in the starting rotation. He was third at the NCAA Championship in 2021 as a sophomore and finished with four straight top 10s to end his career.",
      "He spent five years at Arizona State because of the COVID-19 pandemic and made good use of his time. The Pac-12 scholar-athlete of the year as a senior, Johnston is a few courses short of a Masters' degree from ASU's Thunderbird School of Global Management.",
      "He finished at No. 17 in the PGA Tour University ranking, which made him exempt for the Canada portion of the PGA Tour Americas schedule, and exempt into the second stage of PGA Tour qualifying this week.",
      "Except that Johnston won't be there, all because the Sun Devil took a pitchfork in the road that involved some of Thurmond's best coaching off the course.",
      "Johnston figured he could try all three stages of European tour Q-school and still get home in time for the second stage of PGA Tour qualifying.",
      "\u201cIt was funny because it took me forever to get him to go to the British Amateur,\u201d Thurmond said. \u201cHe always said, \u2018I\u2019m a U.S. guy.' But it slowly changed. He visited (David) Puig in Spain, played the European Amateur. But I couldn't believe it when he called. I told him why not? Give yourself a chance.\"",
      "He made it through the first stage in France with three shots to spare. He went to Spain a month later and tied for third in the second stage, and a week later sailed through 108 holes in Spain at the final stage to earn a European tour card.",
      "Two weeks later, he headed Down Under to make his European tour debut in the Australian PGA and tied for 43rd in a rain-shortened event, then went 1,100 miles down the coast to Melbourne for the Australian Open.",
      "The famed Melbourne sand belt was soaked by rain, and Johnston at this point was worn out. He played 10 out of 12 weeks in Canada. He flew to France, came home, spent two more weeks in Spain enduring the pressure of Q-school, came back home and then headed to Australia.",
      "\"I really didn\u2019t have any expectations,\u201d Johnston said, \u201cwhich probably helped me in the end.\u201d",
      "Johnston said he might not have thought about European tour qualifying if not for the encouragement of Thurmond. The coach feels Johnston knew the right path and only wanted to hear some confirmation.",
      "Either way, it couldn't have worked out any better. Instead of coming back to America for the second stage of Q-school, Johnston is at the Nedbank Challenge in South Africa, with Max Homa as the defending champion against a field that includes Will Zalatoris, Corey Conners, Thriston Lawrence and Nicolai Hojgaard.",
      "Johnston starts next year with tournaments like the Dubai Desert Classic, which features McIlroy and Jon Rahm. The victory gives him a spot in the British Open at Royal Portrush, his first major unless he can qualify for another before then.",
      "\u201cHe's come a long, long way,\u201d Thurmond said. \u201cOf all the people, to think of Ryggs being in South Africa this week blows my mind.\u201d",
      "Still to come by the of the year is a trip home to Libby, the tiny Montana town tucked in the northwest corner that is planning a homecoming for the latest Australian Open champion.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of messages from friends saying the whole town is watching,\u201d Johnston said Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s just really cool to have that kind of support, the thing that you don\u2019t see much other than from small towns.\u201d",

      "Houston\u2019s Azeez Al-Shaair was suspended by the NFL without pay for three games for repeated violations of player safety rules following his hit to the head of Jacksonville\u2019s Trevor Lawrence, which led to a concussion",
      "HOUSTON -- Houston's Azeez Al-Shaair was suspended by the NFL without pay for three games Tuesday for repeated violations of player safety rules following his violent hit to the head of Jacksonville's Trevor Lawrence, which led to a concussion.",
      "Al-Shaair's punishment was announced by NFL vice president of football operations Jon Runyan. In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan noted that he has had multiple offenses for personal fouls and sportsmanship-related rules violations in recent seasons.",
      "Back in the starting lineup after missing two games with a sprained left shoulder, Lawrence scrambled left on a second-and-7 play in the second quarter of Houston\u2019s 23-20 win on Sunday. He initiated a slide before Al-Shaair raised his forearm and unleashed on the defenseless quarterback.",
      "In his letter to Al-Shaair, Runyan called the hit \u201cunacceptable and a serious violation of the playing rules.\u201d",
      "\u201cVideo shows you striking the head/neck area of Jaguars\u2019 quarterback Trevor Lawrence after he clearly goes down in a feet-first slide,\" Runyan wrote. \u201cYou led with your forearm and helmet and delivered a forceful blow to the head/neck area of your opponent when you had time and space to avoid such contact.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair is appealing the suspension, according to a person with knowledge of the decision.",
      "The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the appeal is pending.",
      "Houston general manager Nick Caserio defended Al-Shaair and said he doesn't believe the league is using consistency in issuing punishments like these.",
      "\u201cI probably speak for a lot of teams, not only the Houston Texans, but I think that\u2019s all teams ask for is consistency from the league,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say in this situation, quite frankly, there\u2019s no consistency at all relative to the level of discipline that\u2019s been handed down.\u201d",
      "Caserio pointed to other players who have been ejected for illegal hits this season who have either not been suspended or only suspended for one game.",
      "If the suspension is upheld, Al-Shaair won't be eligible to return to Houston\u2019s active roster until after the team\u2019s Christmas Day game against the Baltimore Ravens. Al-Shaair has a base salary of $1.5 million this season, meaning it will cost him about $265,000 if the three-game suspension is upheld.",
      "Lawrence clenched both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury. He was on the ground for several minutes as teammates came to his defense and mobbed Al-Shaair in what escalated into a brawl.",
      "As Al-Shaair was leaving the field after being ejected, fans started screaming at him. Jaguars veteran guard Brandon Scherff joined in, prompting another altercation with Al-Shaair. Texans teammate Will Anderson grabbed Al-Shaair and was escorting him off the field when a fan threw a water bottle and hit Anderson in the helmet. The fan was later ejected.",
      "Runyan also outlined Al-Shaair's behavior after the hit in announcing the suspension.",
      "\u201cAfter the illegal hit, you proceeded to engage in a brawl, which you escalated when you pulled an opponent down to the ground by his facemask,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAfter the referee announced that you were disqualified for the hit and your unsportsmanlike acts, you removed your helmet and reengaged with your opponent while walking down and across the field, which started another physical confrontation near the end zone.\u201d",
      "This is the third time this season Al-Shaair has been punished by the league. Last week, he was flagged and later fined $11,255 for a late hit out of bounds on Titans running back Tony Pollard.",
      "He was fined earlier this year after he punched Bears running back Roschon Johnson on the sideline in Week 2. That occurred during a scuffle that started after his hard shot on quarterback Caleb Williams near the sideline wasn\u2019t flagged.",
      "\u201cYour lack of sportsmanship and respect for the game of football and all those who play, coach, and enjoy watching it, is troubling and does not reflect the core values of the NFL,\" Runyan told Al-Shaair in the letter. \"Your continued disregard for NFL playing rules puts the health and safety of both you and your opponents in jeopardy and will not be tolerated.\u201d",
      "Caserio was outraged by that part of Runyan's letter.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing is the health and safety of the players and the health and well being of Trevor and hopefully Trevor is going to be OK,\u201d Caserio said. \u201cBut to speak on Azeez\u2019s intentionality about what he intended to do and some of the comments that have been made quite frankly, it\u2019s embarrassing. So we\u2019re going to support Azeez. We love everything about him. We\u2019re glad he\u2019s a part of this team.\u201d",
      "Al-Shaair apologized to Lawrence in a long post on X on Monday, where he said he didn\u2019t see Lawrence sliding until \u201cit was too late\u201d and that it happened \u201cin the blink of an eye\u201d before saying he was sorry for the hit.",
      "Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said Sunday it was a play that \u201dreally has no business being in our league,\" and said Monday that the team is considering shutting Lawrence down for the season.",
      "Former Houston Texans linebacker Denzel Perryman was suspended for three games for repeatedly violating player safety rules last November. His suspension was reduced to two games following an appeal.",
      "Kareem Jackson had a suspension for repeatedly violating player safety reduced from four games to two games last year while playing for the Denver Broncos. He was suspended again for four games later in the season and that suspension was upheld.",

      "Two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell says it was a really easy decision to sign with the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Two-time Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell says it was a really easy decision to sign with the World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the presence of three-time MVP Shohei Ohtani played a part, too.",
      "Snell was introduced Tuesday at Dodger Stadium accompanied by his agent Scott Boras. The left-hander finalized a $182 million, five-year contract last Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt was really easy just cause me and Haeley wanted to live here, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve been talking about for a while,\u201d Snell said, referring to his girlfriend. \u201cThen you look at the team. You look at what they\u2019ve built, what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s just something you want to be a part of.\u201d",
      "Last month, Snell opted out of his deal with San Francisco to become a free agent for the second consecutive offseason after he was slowed by injuries during his lone year with the San Francisco Giants.",
      "Snell gets a $52 million signing bonus, payable on Jan. 25, and annual salaries of $26 million, of which $13.2 million each year will be deferred. Because Snell is a Washington state resident, the signing bonus will not be subject to California income tax.",
      "\u201cIt just played out the way that people around me felt comfortable with, I felt comfortable with, they felt comfortable with,\u201d Snell said. \u201cWe talked and found something that could work for both of us. You want your worth, you want your respect, and you want enough time to where you can really make a name for yourself. I've made a name for myself outside of LA, but I'm going to be invested.\u201d",
      "Two-way star Ohtani, who signed a record $700 million, 10-year deal a year ago, had a historic first season with the Dodgers. He helped them win the franchise's eighth World Series while playing only as designated hitter and became MVP in the National League for the first time after twice winning the award while in the American League.",
      "\u201cIt helps with him in the lineup for sure. That\u2019s big motivation,\u201d Snell said. \u201cYou want to be around players like that when you\u2019re trying to be one of the best in the game. Yeah, it played a big part.\u201d",
      "Snell joins Ohtani and fellow Japanese right-hander Yoshinobu Yamamoto atop Los Angeles\u2019 rotation. All-Star Tyler Glasnow will be back after having his first season in LA derailed by a sprained elbow.",
      "Ohtani didn\u2019t pitch this year while recovering from right elbow surgery but is expected back on the mound in 2025.",
      "The rest of the rotation includes Tony Gonsolin, Landon Knack, Dustin May, Bobby Miller and Emmet Sheehan.",
      "\u201cI pitched on six-man, five-man, four-man rotations,\u201d Snell said. \u201cI'm good with it all as long as we have a plan, we'll execute it.\u201d",
      "Snell, who turns 32 on Wednesday, went 5-3 with a 3.12 ERA in 20 starts this year, throwing a no-hitter at Cincinnati on Aug. 2 for one of only 16 individual shutouts in the major leagues this season. He struck out 145 and walked 44 in 104 innings.",
      "He was sidelined between April 19 and May 22 by a strained left adductor and between June 2 and July 9 by a strained left groin.",
      "Snell won Cy Young Awards in 2018 with Tampa Bay and 2023 with San Diego. He is 76-58 with a 3.19 ERA in nine seasons with the Rays (2016-20), Padres (2021-23) and Giants.",
      "He has known Andrew Friedman, Dodgers president of baseball operations, since he was 18.",
      "In the aftermath of winning the World Series and discussing how the Dodgers could repeat next year, Friedman said, \u201cAll conversations kept coming back to Blake.\u201d",
      "\u201cUsually in major league free agency, you're buying the backside of a guy's career, the accomplishments that they have had,\u201d he said. \u201cWith Blake, one thing that's really exciting for us is, as much success as he's had, we feel like there's more in there.\"",
      "Snell was 2-2 against the Dodgers in his career.",
      "\u201cWe couldn\u2019t beat him, so we\u2019re going to have him join us,\u201d Friedman said.",

      "Ja\u2019Quan McMillian returned an interception 44 yards for a game-sealing touchdown with 1:48 remaining, and Denver spoiled career-best performances by Winston and former Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy in beating the Cleveland Browns 41-32 on Monday night.",
      "The good for Winston: He threw for a franchise-record 497 yards and four touchdowns.",
      "The not-so-good: He tossed two interceptions that Denver returned for scores. The Broncos had three picks for 171 interception return yards against him.",
      "\u201cIt was my fault,\" Winston said. \"I\u2019ve got to play better.\u201d",
      "It was fully reminiscent of his best \u2014 and worst \u2014 year in 2019 with Tampa Bay, when he led the NFL in yards (5,109) and was second in TD passes (33) but also led the league in picks (30).",
      "\u201cI know I\u2019m better than this,\u201d Winston said. \u201cI\u2019m just praying for the Lord to deliver me from pick-6s. That's not me. Phenomenal game on offense, do some great things, but I mess it up.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Jeudy had nine catches for 235 yards \u2014 the most in NFL history by a receiver against his former team \u2014 and a TD. Jeudy, who played his first four seasons with Denver, was booed every time he caught the ball.",

      "Cleveland led 32-31 on Winston\u2019s 5-yard TD pass to Nick Chubb when Nix drove the Broncos to the Browns 9. On fourth-and-1, Payton lined up to go for it but changed his mind after a timeout. Wil Lutz kicked a go-ahead 27-yard field goal with 2:54 remaining.",
      "Winston and the Browns had plenty of time to drive for a winning score, but Winston's throw to Elijah Moore was late and McMillian jumped the route. He fell to the turf untouched after making the catch, got up and sprinted to the end zone.",
      "\u201cThe fact they did it twice was kind of crazy,\u201d Nix said of the interception returns. \u201cI'm over there sitting, the benches have the heaters over there, and I don't even have to move. It's pretty nice for the offense when they bail us out like that.\u201d",
      "Jeudy, a first-round draft pick in 2020, was traded to Cleveland this spring after an up-and-down four seasons with Denver. He paused at the goal line before falling backward into the end zone on his long TD catch. He also caught a 2-point conversion to pull the Browns to 28-25.",
      "\u201cWe had a plan going into it in terms of trying to get him open. I thought the plan was solid,\u201d Cleveland coach Kevin Stefanski said. \"Jerry executed the plan really well. Got him open. Jameis made some throws. It\u2019s hard in the losing effort to feel good about anything.\u201d",
      "The play by Jeudy came just 11 seconds after Nix threw a laser from about 4 yards deep in his end zone to Mims at around the 42. Mims caught it in stride, raced to the end zone and jumped into the stands to celebrate.",

      "The Browns fell to 4-13 in the Mile High City. Dustin Hopkins missed a 47-yard field goal to the left on Cleveland\u2019s opening drive.",

      "U.S. biathletes face \u201cmisogynistic\u201d behavior while racing and fear retaliation if they report their concerns, according to an inquiry by an independent contractor hired to assess athlete safety.",
      "The investigation of U.S. Biathlon was ordered following an Associated Press report that a female team member had been sexually harassed and abused for years while racing on the World Cup circuit.",
      "\u201cIt is very uncomfortable as a woman ... to be in that environment,\" one biathlete said in the report released Monday, which did not identify the athletes to preserve confidentiality.",
      "Many biathletes said they feared if they complained they would be denied training opportunities, financial support and selection for relay teams, according to the assessment by outside auditor Vestry Laight.",
      "The AP reported in January that a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation found that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid had been sexually harassed by a ski-wax technician from 2016 to 2021. Wax technicians play a critical role in biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "SafeSport suspended the wax tech for six months and put him on probation through December. U.S. Biathlon fired him from the team and ordered the audit.",
      "Investigators interviewed athletes, parents, coaches and staff, and studied U.S. Biathlon policies as part of the review. They also sent a confidential survey to 57 biathletes who have competed since 2020.",
      "The report found the U.S. Biathlon Association code of conduct failed to provide clear examples of prohibited behavior. There was also no way to file complaints online or anonymously, making it less likely people would come forward, it said.",
      "The survey showed that while 92% of male respondents said they felt comfortable raising concerns about athlete safety, only 52% of women did. Women were far more likely to say they feared negative consequences to their careers for reporting misconduct \u2014 57% compared to 8% of men.",
      "In addition, 43% of women said they had observed conduct in violation of the USBA code in the past year, compared to 25% of men.",
      "Biathlon officials said they were adopting an \"action plan\u201d in response to the report, including workshops with staff and athletes to define core values and create a way to measure progress.",
      "\u201cWe have full confidence in the USBA leadership to implement the necessary improvements and build a culture that will enable the athletes and our community to thrive,\u201d Bob Hall, USBA board chair, told members in an email.",
      "Reid told the AP on Tuesday that she believes U.S. Biathlon\u2019s response is inadequate, calling it \"mostly a promise to develop metrics and plans, with nothing concrete that they can be held accountable to.\"",
      "She said it was \u201creally rugged\u201d to see how many women had witnessed abuse but feared reporting it.",
      "Many athletes interviewed said they feared retaliation for reporting abuse after what happened to Reid. Six months after SafeSport's investigation, U.S. Biathlon retroactively changed the criteria for being pre-qualified for the World Cup team \u2014 and Reid was bumped off. The change didn\u2019t affect the status of anyone else on the team.",
      "U.S. Biathlon CEO Jack Gierhart told the AP in January the World Cup rule change was not retaliation.",
      "SafeSport has launched a new investigation into whether Gierhart and High Performance Director Lowell Bailey retaliated against Reid by changing the qualification criteria. Gierhart said in an interview Tuesday that he could not comment on that inquiry.",
      "Athletes interviewed for the audit said the way U.S. Biathlon officials handled the Reid case made them feel powerless and unsafe.",
      "\u201cIt was clearly demonstrated by USBA that if an athlete, especially a female athlete, were to bring up this topic they would risk their spot on the team in the upcoming year,\" one athlete wrote in the survey.",
      "\"Not speaking out is the best bet if you want to keep competing for USBA,\u201d another said."

    "story": [
      "Talks on a new collective bargaining agreement between the NHL and NHL Players' Association are set to begin in early 2025",
      "The NHL's collective bargaining agreement does not expire until Sept. 15, 2026. That discussions are set to begin on a new deal in early 2025 is already one step ahead of where hockey has been in labor negotiations in the past.",
      "Commissioner Gary Bettman earlier this week said he expects talks with the NHL Players' Association to begin in February, around the time stakeholders are together for the 4 Nations Face-Off that stands as the latest example of collaboration in the sport. Both sides have issues to broach and changes they want, but the trajectory of the league combined with the strong working relationship between Bettman and union executive director Marty Walsh means there is reason for optimism in a sport that has had three labor stoppages in the past three decades.",
      "Bettman is in the midst of canvassing owners and general managers and Walsh his membership of over 700 players to figure out the issues that are most important to them.",
      "The salary cap system and 50/50 split of revenue that has been in place are not likely to change, and there is already an agreement in place to send NHL players to the Olympics in 2026 and 2030. That leaves a handful of topics to go over.",
      "After previous negotiations centered on how to share money, owners and players have shifted their focus to growing the revenue available to all. Revenues are setting records each season thanks to new U.S. media rights deals, with another coming to Canada in '26, and fresh sources of income like the 4 Nations event, jersey and helmet advertisements and a series of sponsorship agreements.",
      "There are still points of contention, of course.",
      "Expansion fees have gone entirely to owners, including $500 million when Vegas joined and $650 million from Seattle. Bettman has said there are no current plans to expand beyond 32 teams, but it is no secret there is interest from ownership groups in Atlanta and elsewhere, and whether that counts as hockey-related revenue \u2014 which is shared with players \u2014 could be a talking point.",
      "Hockey-related revenue, which includes ticket sales, TV money and more, is what determines the salary cap. After remaining flat and increasing minimally out of the pandemic, the cap for each team is now $88 million, with $92.5 million projected for next season.",
      "With more revenue coming in, there is debate over whether players want to push for a quicker increase in the cap, which would boost salaries for players across the league.",
      "\u201cI like smooth and steady,\u201d Bettman said Sunday in Boston. \u201cNo discussions yet, so when I say smooth and steady, that doesn\u2019t mean I have any numbers in mind and it doesn\u2019t mean the cap couldn\u2019t conceivably go up faster, but we\u2019re not anywhere near to having anything like a substantive discussion on that.\u201d",
      "Walsh said players would love to see the cap go up because \u201cit lifts everyone up.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just talking about the top, marquee players,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cIt\u2019s talking about there\u2019ll be opportunities for all other players to increase, as well. And I think that\u2019s important about the cap going up, and it\u2019s important for the revenue.\u201d",
      "The 2020 CBA extension included caps on the escrow kept from players' paychecks to even out the 50/50 split. Something like that is expected to continue as discussions heat up.",
      "\"It\u2019s just deciding what things are important to you, what things you\u2019d like to maybe be different,\u201d Washington Capitals alternate player representative Trevor van Riemsdyk said Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s a tough thing about all this is not everyone\u2019s in the same position. Some guys are in the midst of long deals, some guys are looking to get new deals, so you\u2019re going want different things.\"",
      "From a league perspective, long-term injured reserve rules and how much money teams are spending over the cap may be among the tweaks requested. Player pensions, medical care and who gets the final say on surgeries and the schedule that has a protracted preseason and hockey until late June could come up from the union side.",
      "The NHL, like other professional leagues, has a history of work stoppages. The 2004-05 lockout wiped out an entire season, and talks in 2012-13 pushed the start until January.",
      "It is hard to envision that sort of trouble this time around. The early start has led to some speculation that a new agreement could be done by late spring or early summer \u2014 more than a year before the deadline.",
      "Bettman said Walsh, a former federal labor secretary and before that mayor of Boston, \u201chas a very professional, sophisticated approach\" and understands that \"everybody does better when you collaborate.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t fiercely represent your constituents, but you pick and choose the things that are important \u2014 and the places where you can work together, you should for the greater good,\u201d Bettman said. \u201cHe gets that better than anybody I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "This will be Walsh's first CBA negotiation. Don Fehr, known for his long run heading the Major League Baseball Players Association, was the union's executive director for the 2012-13 and 2020 talks, and before that it was Bob Goodenow in 2004-05.",
      "\u201cMarty obviously has a ton of experience working with unions,\u201d van Riemsdyk said. \"He\u2019s a hard-nosed guy, he worked in Boston and we have the utmost confidence in him and his ability to portray to the owners what\u2019s most important to the players.\"",
      "Walsh said hockey has been in a transition period far enough away from bargaining talks to not have it be a day-to-day focus, and Bettman has warned against setting any sort of artificial timeline for a new deal.",
      "The NHL is also in a strong place given the quality of the game on the ice and business booming around it. It does not benefit anyone to halt that momentum.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve had probably the greatest financial year, greatest gate year, one of the greatest if not the greatest TV year as far as audience,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cGoing into collective bargaining, that\u2019s a good place to be.\u201d",

      "Miami\u2019s playoff hopes took a nosedive while Alabama\u2019s got a boost in the last rankings before the College Football Playoff bracket is set next weekend",
      "Miami's playoff hopes took an all-but-final nosedive while Alabama's got a boost Tuesday night in the last rankings before the 12-team College Football Playoff bracket is set next weekend.",
      "The Hurricanes (10-2) moved down six spots to No. 12 \u2014 the first team out of the projected bracket after suffering their second loss of the season. They are one spot behind the Crimson Tide (9-3), who won last week and moved up two spots to No. 11, where they are projected as the last team in and the fourth from the Southeastern Conference.",
      "To make things worse for the \u2019Canes, selection committee chair and Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel said there was no way for them to leapfrog Alabama since neither team plays next weekend. The odds of them moving up based on lopsided results in the weekend's conference title games are virtually zero.",
      "The Miami-Alabama sorting was the strongest indication yet that the selection committee is looking at more than mere wins and losses, but also at strength of schedule and other factors that appear to give the SEC an edge.",
      "\u201cWe still think Miami is a very strong team,\u201d Manuel said. \u201cIt came down to a difference in their body of work ... not just wins, not just losses but the totality of the season and how those teams performed.\u201d",
      "He mentioned three key data points: Alabama was 3-1 against current Top 25 teams and Miami is 0-1; Alabama is 6-1 against winning teams while Miami is 4-2; and Miami has lost two of its last three games.",
      "Oregon stayed at No. 1 for the fifth straight week and will head into Saturday's Big Ten title game against Penn State as the only undefeated team in big-time college football.",
      "The pairings for college football's first 12-team playoff will be set Sunday, the day after the conference title games. The playoffs start Dec. 20, with the title game set for Jan. 20 in Atlanta.",
      "Ohio State moved down four spots to No. 6 after its loss to Michigan.",
      "That bumped Texas up a spot to No. 2, Penn State to No. 3, Notre Dame to No. 4 and Georgia to No. 5.",
      "The selection committee all but designated the Big 12 as a one-bid league, moving Arizona State and Iowa State up only one spot each to Nos. 15 and 16.",
      "The top five ranked conference champions are guaranteed bids, which means the winner of the Big 12 title game is in even it doesn't reach the top 12 \u2014 another factor in Miami's likely ouster.",
      "SMU, on a nine-game winning streak, moved up a notch to No. 8 and is the Atlantic Coast Conference\u2019s highest-ranked team, but is still potentially vulnerable if it loses the title game to No. 17 Clemson.",
      "The crux of this week\u2019s drama comes from \u2014 where else? \u2014 the SEC.",
      "Alabama is only two weeks removed from an ugly 24-3 loss at Oklahoma. The Tide still got better treatment than Miami, which fell 42-38 at Syracuse last week with a spot in the ACC title game at stake.",
      "Also in the SEC, Mississippi was ranked 13th and South Carolina 14th \u2014 answering a question of just how deep into the SEC pool the committee was willing to go. Neither team has another chance to build its resume.",
      "Other rankings: No. 7 Tennessee, No. 9 Indiana and No. 10 Boise State. The projected bracket includes four teams each from the Big Ten and SEC and one each from the ACC, Mountain West and Big 12, plus independent Notre Dame.",
      "SEC: This will be awkward for the loser of Texas vs. Georgia. The Longhorns are perched too high to miss the playoff, though a loss would make them 0-2 vs. Georgia and 11-0 against everyone else, and they also have the conference\u2019s easiest schedule. For Georgia, it would be a third loss, but the committee doesn\u2019t seem likely to punish the Bulldogs for playing in the title game.",
      "Big 12, Mountain West: The winner of ASU-Iowa State is still likely outside of the group of four conference champs that receive first-round byes unless UNLV upsets Boise State.",
      "ACC: If Clemson beats SMU, it puts the 17th-ranked team in the bracket and makes the ACC a potential snub for the second straight year. (Remember Florida State last season?)",
      "Based on this week\u2019s rankings. Teams listed by seed.",
      "No. 12 Arizona State at No. 5 Penn State: This game between two teams nobody wants to play right now highlights the obvious benefits of avoiding the first round \u2014 which is still possible for both.",
      "No. 9 Tennessee at No. 8 Ohio State: What could be worse for Ohio State fans than hearing \u201cRocky Top\u201d blaring through their home stadium after a loss?",
      "No. 11 Alabama at No. 6 Notre Dame: Bear Bryant went 0-4 vs. the Fighting Irish. Alabama won both 21st-century matchups in the playoffs.",
      "No. 10 Indiana at No. 7 Georgia: The Hoosiers' welcome to the big time would come between the hedges.",

      "Athletic directors at Iowa State and SMU are in a turf war over the latest College Football Playoff rankings, leading to a \u201cstay off my lawn\" moment on social media.",
      "The background: SMU, at 11-1 and riding a nine-game winning streak into the Atlantic Coast Conference title game, was slotted at No. 8 in Tuesday night's latest ranking. Iowa State, meanwhile, is at 16th and playing for the title of the Big 12, which appears set to receive only one bid in the 12-team field that comes out Sunday.",
      "Cyclones AD Jamie Pollard doesn't like that, and made his feelings clear on X, formerly known as Twitter. He pointed out that SMU hasn't played Clemson, Syracuse, Georgia Tech or Miami \u2014 four of the ACC's top seven teams \u2014 and lost at home to BYU of the Big 12.",
      "\u201cLooks like your lawn may be artificial,\u201d Pollard wrote in a post directed to SMU's AD, Rick Hart.",
      "Hart mowed down Pollard with a response of his own that started with \u201crespect you, but bad take.\u201d",
      "He compared nonconference schedules \u2014 SMU's was better \u2014 and pointed out the Mustangs have trailed for only about six minutes of their last nine games.",
      "\u201cI could go on ... Stay off my lawn!\u201d he posted.",
      "Iowa State appears to be in a win-or-else mode, while SMU's fate is a little less clear.",
      "If the Mustangs lose to No. 17 Clemson, the CFP selection committee will have to decide how much to penalize a team that made a title game, while others in contention did not. The choice could, for instance, pit SMU against Alabama, which is ranked 11th and is the last team in this week's projected bracket.",
      "Of course, some of these differences will be settled on the field Saturday. Pollard, the Iowa State AD, conceded as much by opening his salvo to Hart with this olive branch: \u201cRick, beat Clemson Saturday and I will respect your ranking,\u201d he said.",

      "NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders controlling owner Josh Harris have met with lawmakers on Capitol Hill as efforts push forward to secure access to the RFK Stadium site in the District of Columbia",
      "WASHINGTON -- NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and Washington Commanders controlling owner Josh Harris met with congressional lawmakers Monday on Capitol Hill as efforts push forward to secure access to the RFK Stadium site in the District of Columbia.",
      "Two people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Goodell and Harris held a series of meetings concerning the RFK Stadium proposal, among other topics. The people spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because their appearance on Capitol Hill was not publicized.",
      "According to one of the people, the ongoing security issue of drones on game days was also discussed in meetings with incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., outgoing Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and outgoing Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.",
      "Goodell remained in the area after attending the Commanders\u2019 game Sunday against Tennessee at aging Northwest Stadium in Landover, Maryland.",
      "The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources last month passed the D.C. Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium Campus Revitalization Act on to the full Senate for approval. If passed and signed into law by the president, it would transfer the land with the husk of the former stadium and surrounding areas less than 2 miles (3.22 kilometers) east of the U.S. Capitol from the federal to the D.C. government for up to 99 years.",
      "D.C. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton called it a \u201cwin-win for the federal and D.C. governments\u201d that could \u201ctransform the campus from acres of asphalt to a complex focused on community sports, recreation, park space and cultural amenities.\u201d",
      "James Comer, R-Ky., who has been advocating for a stadium deal, said, \u201cThe will help pave a path for the nation\u2019s capital to create meaningful new jobs, add millions in city revenue and transform the city\u2019s vacant RFK waterfront into a lively destination for all Americans.\u201d",
      "It is no guarantee the Commanders would build their next state-of-the-art stadium there, but getting this agreement done is one of the major steps in paving the way to making it possible to return to what had been the organization's home from 1961-96.",
      "\u201cThe Commanders have been fortunate to have interest from three incredible jurisdictions as we search for a new home and stadium,\u201d a team spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe vote ... brings us one step closer towards continuing conversations with D.C., along with Maryland and Virginia, as a potential future home for our franchise.\u201d",
      "Sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia all remain in the running for the new stadium, a process that was ongoing long before Harris' group bought the team from longtime owner Dan Snyder last year for a North American professional sports record $6.05 billion.",
      "Harris and several of his co-owners, including Mitch Rales and Mark Ein, grew up in the area and were fans of the team when it played at RFK during the glory days, which included Super Bowl titles in 1982, \u201887 and \u201991.",
      "They took control after Snyder rebranded as the Commanders, following a temporary stint as the Washington Football Team when he bowed to pressure from sponsors and activists in the summer of 2020, dropping the name the franchise was known by for nearly nine decades. It could change again, though Harris has said the old name would not return.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mon., last summer threatened to block the RFK Stadium bill until the NFL and the Commanders honor, in some form, the old Indian head logo that was designed by a member of the Blackfeet Nation in the state of Montana.",
      "Daines recently gave his blessing, saying there had been \"good faith negotiations\u201d with the league and team about using the old logo. A spokesperson for Daines said last week part of the ongoing negotiations are related to using the old logo to support Native American philanthropic causes and plans to show the logo on future merchandise.",

      "NASCAR opened the season with washouts in the first two races of the year that could have set the tone for a miserable 2024 campaign",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR opened the season with near washouts in the first two races of the year that could have set the tone for a miserable 2024 campaign.",
      "Instead, the top motorsports series in the United States showed it could be flexible, moving its preseason race at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum up a full day to set the stage for an unpredictable year.",
      "There were 18 different winners, including Austin Dillon, who was disqualified from advancing to the playoffs for the aggressive driving that secured his victory. Joey Logano was the controversial Cup Series champion and triggered discussion about the fairness of the playoffs.",
      "NASCAR heads toward the 2025 season with a points-paying Cup Series race outside the United States for the first time in the modern era: A trip to Mexico City, a highlight for the first year of NASCAR's new, 7-year multi-partner television package. It also continues to fight a federal antitrust lawsuit filed by two teams, one of them owned by Michael Jordan.",
      "NASCAR President Steve Phelps found himself defending the four drivers racing for the title last month and promising to take a look at the format if warranted. He also touted positive television ratings and what worked for the series in 2024.",
      "\u201cIt says the sport is resilient and the sport is growing,\u201d Phelps said.",
      "In incredible rain.",
      "The third running of the exhibition Clash at the Coliseum was under threat before the teams arrived because of heavy rain headed toward California. With an eye on the radar, NASCAR knew there was no way it would able to race on its scheduled day.",
      "So officials crammed an entire two-day event into one Saturday \u2014 a day the Coliseum wasn't even supposed to be open to fans \u2014 in an unprecedented move that cost NASCAR dearly in both television ratings and money.",
      "\u201cWe did something we had never done before. We pulled a race up a day, and we raced on Saturday night,\u201d Phelps said. \u201cGot crushed in the ratings, right? Saturday night is the lowest-rated day of the week, but it was the right thing to do.\u201d",
      "Rain also postponed the season-opening Daytona 500 in February, and the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway was rain shortened \u2014 that one ruined Kyle Larson's shot to complete the Indy 500-Coke 500 double. The Chicago street race was also interrupted by rain, making three of the biggest events of the season dampened by weather.",
      "And yet, Phelps noted that NASCAR had climbed out of 27% ratings hole by the end of the season.",
      "\u201cIf you had asked me at the beginning of the year, \u2018I will bet you that you can dig out of a 27% hole at the 500 and then two double-digital ratings declines on your next two highest rated races,\u2019 I would have said there is no way that\u2019s going to happen,\" he said. \u201cAnd we sit here for our Cup races, we are in the positive numbers.\u201d",
      "Most of the winners were familiar faces: Larson, with a series-high six wins, and Daytona 500 winner William Byron was among five drivers who scored three victories apiece this season.",
      "Logano, who won his third Cup championship, had only one regular-season victory. But he won three playoff races to become only the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more Cup titles.",
      "There were some surprises, too. Chase Briscoe and Harrison Burton won the final two races of the regular season to snag the final two playoff spots in the 16-driver field. It was bittersweet for both.",
      "Briscoe represented Stewart-Haas Racing, which essentially closed at the end of the season. Burton, a first-time Cup Series winner, won in his final season with Wood Brothers Racing.",
      "Dillon earned his first victory in nearly two years with a win at Richmond Raceway that ultimately was thrown out by NASCAR because he wrecked two cars in the closing laps. There are also allegations that Richard Childress Racing bought the setup information on Dillon's car from a Joe Gibbs Racing employee. JGR has refused to comment and no formal complaint has been lodged.",
      "At the penultimate race of the season, with spots in the championship on the line, NASCAR levied heavy fines against multiple teams for cooperating with each other in order to help drivers representing the same manufacturers. NASCAR found it manipulative and said it won't rule out driver suspensions in the future.",
      "NASCAR also won't rule out taking a look at the playoff format after the title was won by Logano, who was technically eliminated from the field after the second round. But when Alex Bowman's car failed inspection following the elimination race, Logano was reinstated and went on to give Roger Penske his third consecutive Cup Series title.",
      "NASCAR was adamant the correct four drivers raced for the title \u2014 Logano, regular-season champion Tyler Reddick, Byron and 2023 champion Ryan Blaney \u2014 but said it would review the system if needed.",
      "\u201cWe are always looking if there are opportunities for us to tweak something,\u201d said Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR chief operating officer. \u201cWe are not the only sport where the best statistical team does not get to the Final Four or the Super Bowl or the World Series. We\u2019re not going to go away from playoffs. We read fans and everything. We will, as we always do, we\u2019ll absolutely look at what form the playoffs take in the offseason.\u201d",
      "NASCAR for more than two years was locked in contentious negotiations with the teams over its revenue-sharing model, based on charter agreements. A deal described by the teams as a \u201ctake-it-or-leave-it\u201d final offer was presented 48 hours before the start of the playoffs in September.",
      "Of the 15 teams that held 36 charters, 13 signed. The two that refused \u2014 23XI Racing, which is owned by NBA Hall of Famer Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin, and Front Row Motorsports, owned by businessman Bob Jenkins \u2014 are now suing NASCAR over antitrust claims.",
      "NASCAR has since revoked the charter offers to the two teams, which held two each. The charters guarantee a spot in the field in all 38 races as well as guaranteed revenue. The teams can still compete as \u201copen\u201d cars but will not have the same protections. Both teams had agreements to buy charters from Stewart-Haas Racing to expand their organizations to three cars, but NASCAR said it will not honor those transfers.",
      "The teams have asked for a December hearing in search of an injunction to clear the situation up a little bit before the charters expire at the end of this year. NASCAR on Monday asked for the suit to be dismissed outright.",
      "The ramifications are huge but it isn't clear how 23XI and Front Row can or will proceed if there isn't resolution by February. An attorney representing the teams, Jeffrey Kessler, contends the drivers and sponsors can leave both organizations if the cars aren't chartered. And, without the transfer of the SHR charters, expansion is in question even though both teams have hired drivers for 2025.",
      "It's a messy fight that will likely linger until a judge either reaches a decision or a settlement is made \u2014 and nobody knows if that will be before the preseason Clash, which will be held for the first time at Bowman-Gray Stadium in North Carolina on Feb. 2.",

      "China has announced a ban on exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications",
      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",

      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",

      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",

      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",

      "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "The guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.",
      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

      "Alexander Mashinsky, 58, of Manhattan, entered the plea in New York federal court to commodities and securities fraud.",
      "He admitted illegally manipulating the price of Celsius\u2019s proprietary crypto token while secretly selling his own tokens at inflated prices to pocket about $48 million before Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.",

      "And he said that in 2019, he was selling the crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not. He said he knew customers would draw false comfort from that too.",

      "He said Mashinsky used catchy slogans like \u201cUnbank Yourself\u201d to entice prospective customers with a pledge that their money would be as safe in crypto accounts as money would be in a bank. Meanwhile, prosecutors said, Mashinsky and co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund market purchases of the Celsius token to prop up its value.",

      "Celsius employees from multiple departments who noticed false and misleading statements in the sessions warned Mashinsky, but they were ignored, the indictment said.",
      "A plea agreement Mashinsky made with prosecutors calls for him to be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and to forfeit over $48 million, which is the amount of money he allegedly made by selling his company's token.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 8."

      "The global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end after the popstar performed more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end.",
      "There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift\u2019s decision to put on a 3 \u00bd-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different \u201ceras\u201d of her career \u2014 a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note.",
      "But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy \u2014 a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her.",
      "\u201cRight now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,\u201d said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift\u2019s concerts \u2014 by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s their therapy.\u201d",
      "Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the \u201clivestream queen,\u201d says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar.",
      "Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There\u2019s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine your favorite sports team,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cThey\u2019re still a team, but they\u2019re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That\u2019s going to leave a hole for some folks.\u201d",
      "Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool.",
      "\u201cThis is the very first time I\u2019ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cthis tour has really become my entire life.\u201d Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end.",
      "Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada.",
      "By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, \u201cSpeak Now \u201d and 2014's record \u201c1989,\u201d as well as released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,\u201d said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. \u201cAnd this is a woman that owning it, she\u2019s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women\u2019s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.\"",
      "Even the word \u201cera\u201d has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases \u2014 are you in your \u201cvillain era\u201d or a \u201chealing era\u201d?",
      "\u201cI think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,\u201d said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. \u201cWhether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she\u2019s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she\u2019s achieved a level where it\u2019s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.\u201d",
      "Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer \u2014 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides \u2014 passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.",
      "And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows.",
      "\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\u201d Swift later wrote in a statement. \u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\u201d",
      "Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets \u2014 which also became an iconic feature of the shows \u2014 on a nearby tree.",
      "Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences \u2014 both old and new.",
      "\u201cI feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,\u201d Wong said of Swifties. \u201cNow the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.\u201d"

      "The total five-year average of cold-stunned sea turtles in Massachusetts was around 200 in the early 2010s, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration data, growing to more than 700 in recent years.",
      "All the turtles at New England Aquarium's hospital are juveniles, mostly critically endangered Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles whose migratory patterns lead to strandings here. They were being treated for maladies ranging from pneumonia to sepsis.",
      "The Kemp's \u2014 the world's smallest sea turtle \u2014 lives largely in the Gulf of Mexico and ventures into the Atlantic Ocean when juvenile. Some recent science, including a 2019 study in the journal PLoS One, says the warming of the ocean increases the chance of cold-stunning events once the turtles reach the Northwest Atlantic. Warmer seas may push the turtles north in a way that makes stranding more likely, the study said.",
      "Upon arrival, the turtles are often critically ill.",
      "\u201cThe majority of the turtles arrive with serious ailments such as pneumonia, dehydration, traumatic injuries, or sepsis,\u201d said Melissa Joblon, director of animal health at the aquarium.",
      "The turtle hospital rehabilitates the animals so they can be safely returned to the wild, sometimes locally and sometimes in warmer southern waters, Kennedy said. Around 80% survive.",
      "Some of the turtles that arrive at the hospital are green turtles or loggerheads, which are not as endangered as the Kemp's ridley, but still face numerous threats.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, getting these turtles back to the wild is what we are doing and what we want,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe want them back in the ocean.\u201d ___",

    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is alleging in a lawsuit that Amazon secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods in the city",
      "The District of Columbia sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods while still charging millions of dollars for a membership that promises the benefit.",
      "The complaint filed in District of Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, which costs consumers $139 per year or $14.99 per month for fast deliveries \u2014 including one-day, two-day and same-day shipments \u2014 along with other enhancements.",
      "In mid-2022, the lawsuit alleges, the Seattle-based online retailer imposed what it called a delivery \u201cexclusion\u201d on two low-income zip codes in the district \u2014 20019 and 20020 \u2014 and began relying exclusively on third-party delivery services such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, rather than its own delivery systems.",
      "Amazon says it made the change based on concerns about driver safety.",
      "\u201cThere have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages\u201d in the two zip codes and the company made the change to \u201cput the safety of delivery drivers first,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement.",
      "\u201cWe made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cThe claims made by the attorney general, that our business practices are somehow discriminatory or deceptive, are categorically false.\u201d",
      "The District of Columbia's attorney general\u2019s office alleged the company never told Prime members in the two zip codes about the change even though they experienced slower deliveries as a result. Amazon also did not tell new customers about the exclusions when they signed up for Prime memberships, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAmazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement, referencing the two areas in the city where Amazon is accused of excluding its speediest deliveries.",
      "\u201cWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" Schwalb said.",
      "The lawsuit says Amazon has nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the two zip codes, a number that represents nearly half of the population. Prime members in those neighborhoods have ordered more than 4.5 million packages in the past four years, and are more likely to rely on Amazon since they have fewer services and retail stores nearby, the city said. The area is also a notorious food desert.",
      "The district says that in 2021, before Amazon implemented its delivery \u201cexclusion,\u201d more than 72% of Prime packages in the impacted zip codes were delivered within two days. But last year, it was only 24%, according to the complaint.",
      "Meanwhile, the district's lawsuit says Prime members who lived in other parts of the city received two-day deliveries 75% of the time. Amazon was also improving its delivery speeds nationwide.",
      "When some customers in the city complained about the slower deliveries, Amazon concealed the true reason for the delays and \u201cdeceptively implied\" that the delays \"were simply due to natural fluctuations in shipping circumstances, rather than an affirmative decision by Amazon,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "District officials are asking the court to issue an order prohibiting Amazon from \u201cengaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\u201d They also want the company to pay restitution or damages to affected Prime members, as well as civil penalties.",
      "Nantel said Amazon is \u201calways transparent\u201d with its customers \u201cduring the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.\u201d Since 2022, nearly 1.5 million Prime-eligible products were delivered in two days or less to Prime customers residing in the two zip codes, the company said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the attorney general and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,\u201d Nantel aid. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the safety of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed Wednesday represents the second major legal battle between Amazon and the District of Columbia which also filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company."

Whether we found it on the yellow brick road, or in videos from a Thailand zoo, or perhaps in unlikely Olympic heroes, we gravitated toward fantasy and feel-good pop culture moments this year.",
      "There were new trends, as always. \u201cBrat summer\u201d became a thing, as did \u201cdemure, mindful.\u201d And for some inexplicable reason, we became obsessed with celebrity lookalike contests.",
      "There were breakups \u2014 Bennifer is, again, a thing of the past \u2014 and reunions: Oasis, please try to stay together for the tour. And some things stayed, remarkably, the same: Taylor Swift and Beyonc\u00e9 kept on breaking records and making history.",

How is everybody doing?\u201d The answers hint at something deeper and more worrisome. \u201cNot great, Elmo. Not great,\u201d says one milder reply. Doing much better is the viral phenomenon called \u201cBARBENHEIMER,\u201d which makes its awards season debut at the GOLDEN GLOBES.

Meanwhile, if you're looking for a single week that encapsulates peak SWIFT cultural dominance, try this: she begins with the Grammys in Los Angeles (becoming the first artist to win album of the year four times AND announcing a new album), then heads to Tokyo for four tour dates, then jets back just in time for the Super Bowl in Las Vegas \u2014 where she shares a passionate smooch with boyfriend TRAVIS KELCE on the field of victory.",
      "\u201cWhat was I made for?\u201d BILLIE EILISH sings at the OSCARS, channeling BARBIE. And what was KEN made for? Not entirely clear \u2014 but it's clear RYAN GOSLING was made to play him.

      "The first fiber breakage happened on Monday morning, the other one in the afternoon.",

    "story": [
      "Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the carmaker that owns brands like Jeep and Ram and Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot",
      "NEW YORK -- Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares is stepping down after nearly four years in the top spot of the automaker, which owns car brands like Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, amid an ongoing struggle with slumping sales.",
      "The world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker announced that its board accepted Tavares' resignation Sunday, effective immediately.",
      "Stellantis noted Sunday that the process of finding a new, permanent CEO is \u201cwell under way.\u201d In the meantime, the company says a new interim executive committee, led by chairman John Elkann, will be established.",
      "As head of PSA Peugeot, Tavares took control of the Netherlands-based company in January 2021 \u2014 when it merged with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, creating an automotive giant that is the parent to several well-known brands today. Beyond Jeep, Citro\u00ebn and Ram, the company portfolio includes Dodge, Chrysler, Fiat, Peugeot, Maserati and Opel.",
      "Stellantis' North American operations had been the company\u2019s main source of profits for some time, but struggles piled up this year, with the company citing rising competition and larger market changes. As a result of lofty sticker prices and fewer affordable options, many high-priced vehicles have been left unsold on dealers' lots.",
      "For its third quarter, Stellantis posted 27% plunge in net revenues, as gaps in launching new products and action to reduce inventories also slashed global shipments of new vehicles by 20%.",
      "The carmaker reported net revenues of 33 billion euros (nearly $36 billion ) in the three-month period ending Sept. 30, down from 45 billion euros in the same period last year. All regions except South America reported double-digit dips in revenues \u2014 led by North America, which plunged 42% to 12.4 billion euros ($13.1 billion).",
      "In recent months, Tavares had come under fire from U.S. dealers and the United Auto Workers union after the release of dismal financial performance reports. He also oversaw cost-cutting efforts that included delaying factory openings and laying off union workers \u2014 further straining the company's relations with the UAW, which filed several grievances against Stellantis and threatened to strike in recent months.",
      "The UAW welcomed Tavares' resignation with president Shawn Fain calling the move \u201ca major step in the right direction for a company that has been mismanaged and a workforce that has been mistreated for too long.\u201d He noted that thousands of UAW members had been calling for Tavares' firing for weeks for what Fain called the CEO's \u201creckless mismanagement of the company.\u201d",
      "\u201cTavares is leaving behind a mess of painful layoffs and overpriced vehicles sitting on dealership lots,\u201d Fain said in a statement. He added that the union looks forward to sitting down with Stellantis\u2019 new chief executive and \u201cwill keep using all means available\u201d to hold the company accountable.",
      "Beyond the U.S., Stellantis has faced pressure in Italy \u2014 where lawmakers questioned the former chief executive over the company's production plans in October, with the far-right government accusing the company of relocating assembly plants to low-cost countries. Tens of thousands of autoworkers in the country also held a one-day walkout, calling for more employment certainty and protections.",
      "In efforts to revive sales, Stellantis previously made a number of leadership changes in October, which included naming new heads of operations in North America and Europe. At the time, the company expected Tavares to step down in early 2026, closer to the end of his five-year contract.",
      "The company confirmed in September that it was searching for a CEO to eventually succeed Tavares, but it maintained those efforts were part of standard leadership transition plans.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Stellantis\u2019 senior independent director Henri de Castries said that Stellantis' success is \u201crooted in a perfect alignment\u201d between shareholders, the company's board and the CEO \u2014 but noted \u201cdifferent views\u201d had emerged in recent weeks, resulting in the decision to approve Tavares' resignation.",
      "Elkann, the chairperson of Stellantis' board, thanked Tavares for \u201chis years of dedicated service and the role he has played in the creation of Stellantis\u201d in an additional statement. He added that he looks forward to appointing a new CEO.",
      "Stellantis did not comment further beyond Sunday's release. The announcement arrived shortly after Bloomberg reported Tavares' plans to step down, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter."

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year",
      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said.",

      "Consumers in the U.S. are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to make the most of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon on Cyber Monday",
      "Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday.",
      "Even though e-commerce is now part and parcel of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday \u2014 a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation \u2014 has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it.",
      "Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's \u2014 and the year's \u2014 biggest \u2014 shopping day for e-commerce.",
      "Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday night, per Adobe \u2014 reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute.",
      "For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time on Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members on Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "Consumer spending for Cyber Week \u2014 the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday \u2014 provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays.",
      "Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",
      "At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items.",
      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday. When the final tally is in, Adobe expects consumers will have spent between\u202f$13.2 billion\u202fand\u202f$13.5 billion\u202ffor the day, making Cyber Monday the biggest online shopping day of the year__and of all time, Adobe said.",
      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",
      "E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute \u2014 with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company.",
      "Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. \u201cHot products\u201d included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care.",
      "Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes.",
      "RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest.",
      "Sensormatic Solutions, which also tracks store traffic, said its preliminary analysis showed retail store traffic on Black Friday was down 8.2% compared to 2023.",
      "Grant Gustafson, head of retail consulting and analytics at Sensormatic Solutions, noted that in-store traffic was getting spread across multiple days since many retailers offered generous discounts before and after Black Friday.",
      "\u201cSome of the extended Black Friday promotions really ended up leading to a little bit of a softer day-of traffic than expected,\u201d Gustafson said.",
      "While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more \u201cexperience-driven spending\u201d in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned.",
      "Jie Zhang, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland\u2019s Robert H. Smith School of Business, told The Associated Press ahead of the post-Thanksgiving shopping weekend that he expected shoppers to \u201cindulge themselves a bit more\u201d when it comes to \u201cself-gifting,\u201d increasing interest in categories like self care.",
      "Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season \u2014 with consumers opening their wallets to invest or \u201ctrade up\u201d to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.",
      "Brie Carere, executive vice president and chief customer officer at FedEx, cited strong shipping volume for Thanksgiving weekend, and CyberMonday has had a good start. She anticipated that FedEx\u2019s shipping volume on the online shopping holiday will be slightly up over the 19 million items shipped a year ago on the holiday.",
      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",
      "\u201cI do think that we\u2019re going to see some retailers be disappointed in their volume numbers,\u201d she said.",
      "Carere also doesn\u2019t anticipate much of a lull in shipping between Thanksgiving weekend and last two weeks before Christmas because of the shorter season.",
      "Jim Katsafanas, president of U.S. Small Business Sales, UPS, agreed, noting last week \u201cwe are going to see a pretty consistent surge of volume right through the end. \u201d",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 12:02:37 -0500",
    "summary": "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
    "story": [
      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Just over a month after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm, Super Micro Computer says a review committee has found no evidence of fraud or misconduct among the server maker\u2019s leadership",
      "NEW YORK -- Just over a month after Ernst & Young resigned as its public accounting firm, Super Micro Computer says a review committee has found no evidence of fraud or misconduct among the server maker\u2019s leadership.",
      "Super Micro is also searching for a new chief financial officer and appointing other executives per recommendations from the committee, which began its review several months ago \u2014 after EY communicated concerns over issues like transparency, internal control related to financial reporting and integrity of management while conducting its first audit for the company.",
      "Additional information that emerged during this review eventually led EY to resign as Super Micro's public accountant in October. Super Micro, which disagreed with EY's decision, later appointed BDO as its new independent auditor last month.",
      "Super Micro announced that the committee, formed by the board as well as external counsel, completed its review on Monday. The company said that the conclusions EY laid out in its resignation \u201cwere not supported by the facts\u201d found in this probe \u2014 maintaining that there was no evidence of misconduct.",
      "As a result, Super Micro does not expect past financial reports to be restated. Shares for Super Micro climbed over 20% Monday morning.",
      "Beyond the findings of this review, Super Micro also laid out plans to appoint new leadership, which it says follow recommendations from the committee. Super Micro disclosed that it has begun looking for a new CFO, with David Weigand continuing in the role until the board names a successor. The company also said it would be \u201caccelerating its search\u201d for a chief compliance officer and for a general counsel.",
      "In addition, Super Micro announced it has appointed Kenneth Cheung, current vice president of finance and corporate controller, as chief accounting officer.",
      "It's been a tumultuous year for Super Micro \u2014 and EY's resignation wasn't the first time its accounting practices have come into question. Back in August, short-selling firm Hindenburg Research released a report alleging ample accounting manipulation at the company, pointing to \u201cglaring accounting red flags\u201d and evidence of undisclosed transactions. It also accused Super Micro of rehiring top executives that were directly involved in a 2018 scandal. At the time, Super Micro said it would not comment \u201con rumors and speculation.\u201d",
      "Following these accusations, The Wall Street Journal and others reported that the Justice Department was beginning a probe into Super Micro, citing people familiar with the matter.",
      "Super Micro has been among tech companies recently riding a the artificial intelligence wave. In August, Super Micro reported fourth-quarter revenue of $5.31 billion, a more than 143% increase over the $2.18 billion it reported in the same quarter of 2023."

    "story": [
      "A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package",
      "DOVER, Del. -- A Delaware judge has reaffirmed her ruling that Tesla must revoke Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package",
      "Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick on Monday denied a request by attorneys for Musk and Tesla\u2019s corporate directors to vacate her ruling earlier this year requiring the company to rescind the unprecedented pay package.",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argued that they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "The rulings came in a lawsuit filed by a Tesla stockholder who challenged Musk\u2019s 2018 compensation package.",
      "McCormick concluded in January that Musk engineered the landmark pay package in sham negotiations with directors who were not independent. The compensation package initially carried a potential maximum value of about $56 billion, but that sum has fluctuated over the years based on Tesla\u2019s stock price.",
      "Following the original court ruling, Tesla shareholders met in June and ratified Musk\u2019s 2018 pay package for a second time, again by an overwhelming margin.",
      "Defense attorneys then argued that the second vote makes clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "McCormick, who seemed skeptical of the defense arguments during an August hearing, said in Monday\u2019s ruling that those arguments were fatally flawed.",
      "\u201cThe large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\u201d McCormick wrote in a 103-page opinion.",
      "The judge noted, among other things, that a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction.",
      "\u201cEven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement,\u201d she added.",
      "Musk expressed his disagreement with the ruling in a post on X, the social media platform he owns. \u201cShareholders should control company votes, not judges,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, McCormick found that the $5.6 billion fee request by the shareholder\u2019s attorneys, which at one time approached $7 billion based on Tesla\u2019s trading price, went too far.",
      "\u201cIn a case about excessive compensation, that was a bold ask,\u201d McCormick wrote.",
      "Attorneys for the Tesla shareholder argue that their work resulted in the \u201cmassive\u201d benefit of returning shares to Tesla that otherwise would have gone to Musk and diluted the stock held by other Tesla investors. They value that benefit at $51.4 billion, using the difference between the stock price at the time of McCormick\u2019s January ruling and the strike price of some 304 million stock options granted to Musk.",
      "While finding that the methodology used to calculate the fee request was sound, the judge noted that the Delaware\u2019s Supreme Court has noted that fee award guidelines \u201cmust yield to the greater policy concern of preventing windfalls to counsel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fee award here must yield in this way, because $5.6 billion is a windfall no matter the methodology used to justify it,\u201d McCormick wrote. A fee award of $345 million, she said, was \u201can appropriate sum to reward a total victory.\u201d",
      "The fee award amounts to almost exactly half the current record $688 million  in legal fees awarded in 2008 in litigation stemming from the collapse of Enron."

    "story": [
      "Scientists and culture experts in New Zealand have begun the first-ever dissection of a spade-toothed whale, the world's rarest whale species",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "Two company executives, David Zinsner and Michelle Johnston Holthaus, will act as interim co-CEOs while the company searches for a replacement for Gelsinger, who also stepped down from the company's board.",
      "The departure of Gelsinger, whose career spanned more than 40 years, underscores the turmoil at Intel. The company was once a dominant force in the semiconductor industry but has been eclipsed by rival Nvidia, which has cornered the market for chips that run artificial intelligence systems.",
      "Gelsinger started at Intel in 1979 and was its first chief technology officer. He returned to the company as chief executive in 2021.",
      "Gelsinger said his exit was \u201cbittersweet as this company has been my life for the bulk of my working career,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cI can look back with pride at all that we have accomplished together. It has been a challenging year for all of us as we have made tough but necessary decisions to position Intel for the current market dynamics.\u201d",
      "Zinsner is executive vice president and chief financial officer at Intel. Holthaus was appointed to the newly created position of CEO of Intel Products, which includes the client computing, data center and AI groups.",
      "Frank Yeary, independent chair of Intel's board, will become interim executive chair.",
      "\u201cPat spent his formative years at Intel, then returned at a critical time for the company in 2021,\u201d Yeary said in a statement. \"As a leader, Pat helped launch and revitalize process manufacturing by investing in state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing, while working tirelessly to drive innovation throughout the company.\u201d",
      "Gelsinger's departure comes as Intel\u2019s financial woes have been piling up. The company posted a $16.6 billion loss and halted its dividend in the most recent quarter, and its shares have fallen by about 60% since he took over as CEO. Gelsinger announced plans in August to slash 15% of its huge workforce \u2014 or about 15,000 jobs \u2014 as part of cost-cutting efforts to to save $10 billion in 2025.",
      "Nvidia\u2019s ascendance, meanwhile, was cemented earlier this month when it replaced Intel on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.",
      "Unlike some of rivals, Intel manufactures chips in addition to designing them. Under Gelsinger, the company has been working to build up its foundry business making semiconductors in the U.S. designed by other firms, in a bid to compete with rivals such as market leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. or TSMC.",
      "Intel has benefited from tens of billions of dollars that the administration has pledged to support construction of U.S. chip foundries and reduce reliance on Asian suppliers, which Washington sees as a security weakness.",
      "After taking over as CEO, Gelsinger unveiled plans to build a $20 billion chipmaking facility in central Ohio, and poured billions more into expanding in Europe, where leaders were also worried about dependence on Asia.",
      "The Biden administration had said it would give Intel up to $8.5 billion in federal funding for semiconductor plants around the country, but last week it trimmed that amount, according to three people familiar with the grant who spoke on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Shares of the Santa Clara, California, company jumped in early trading Monday but ended the day down 0.5%.",

      "Closing arguments have begun in the trial of a tech consultant in the stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco last year",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Closing arguments began on Monday in the trial of a tech consultant in the 2023 stabbing death of Cash App founder Bob Lee in San Francisco, an event that shocked the broader tech community whose members mourned the loss of an entrepreneur they called charismatic and kind.",
      "San Francisco prosecutors say Nima Momeni stabbed Lee three times after hearing that Lee's drug dealer friend plied Momeni's younger sister with GHB and other drugs and sexually assaulted her.",
      "\u201cOne person called 911 pleading for help, saying somebody stabbed me,\u201d said Dane Reinstedt, assistant district attorney, adding that the other person never called police or told anyone what happened that night until the trial.",
      "Defense attorneys will make their closing arguments Tuesday in a trial that started Oct. 14. Prosecutors will then have a chance to respond to the defense\u2019s closing.",
      "Defense attorneys say Lee, 43, was on a multi-day drug bender of cocaine and ketamine that made him agitated and violent, and that he attacked the defendant with a knife. They said Momeni was forced to use his Krav Maga martial arts skills in the early morning hours of April 4, 2023, after making a \u201c bad joke \u2033 that upset Lee \u2014 and did not realize he had stabbed him.",
      "Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted of murder. He has pleaded not guilty in a case so high profile that San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins stepped into the room Monday for part of the closing.",
      "The trial has been emotionally taxing for family members of both men. Mahnaz Tayarani, mother of the defendant, has sat on one side of the court room while Lee\u2019s father, brother and ex-wife sat on the other.",
      "The prosecution on Monday started its closing argument with a 911 call in which Lee could be heard asking repeatedly for help. Lee's ex-wife, Krista Lee, cradled her daughter Scout as the 16-year-old wept on her mother's shoulder. They left the room. The Lees have two children.",
      "Reinstedt on Monday mocked Momeni\u2019s defense as he walked jurors through weeks of evidence.",
      "He said Momeni was furious with Lee for introducing Khazar Momeni, with whom he was friends, to a drug dealer who gave her GHB, known as a date-rape drug, hours before the stabbing. They say Momeni grilled Lee earlier in the evening about what happened to his sister at the drug dealer\u2019s apartment and sent text messages saying that the two men were creeps and sexual predators.",
      "Then, Momeni met up with Lee at his sister\u2019s condo, took a paring knife from her kitchen set, drove Lee to a secluded area by the Bay Bridge and stabbed him three times, Reinstedt said.",
      "\u201cThat protectiveness of the defendant\u2019s little sister is what led to all of this,\u201d Reinstedt said.",
      "Surveillance video shows the two men leaving the posh condo of Khazar Momeni around 2 a.m. and getting into Momeni\u2019s BMW. Other surveillance then shows them getting out of the car in an isolated section of the city by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Momeni testified he stopped his car after going over a pothole that caused Lee to spill the beer he was holding. Momeni said he then cracked a joke suggesting Lee should spend his last night visiting the city with family instead of trying to find a strip club to keep the party going.",
      "That\u2019s when Lee suddenly pulled a knife out of his jacket pocket, Momeni said. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "\u201cI was scared for my life,\u201d Momeni said in earlier testimony that was at times rambling and contentious.",
      "Reinstedt said Momeni's story made no sense given Lee's peaceful nature. He said Momeni never called police to report Lee's alleged attack or even after he learned Lee had died of stab wounds on the street where he had last seen him.",
      "The prosecutor said the puncture wounds were clean, clear and deep, and not the result of any kind of self-defense tussle, he said. Just about all of the DNA \u2014 99% \u2014 found on the handle of the knife belonged to Momeni, the prosecutor said.",
      "Video of the two men by the bridge is grainy, but Reinstedt said it clearly showed Momeni's figure lunging repeatedly at Lee. There was no deflecting and redirecting of any knife in Lee's hand, he said.",
      "Reinstedt also showed video of Momeni and Lee leaving the condo, Lee's jacket flapping to show there was no knife hidden inside.",
      "Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m., dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to his generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died."

    "story": [
      "Positioned along the seismically active Ring of Fire, Indonesia and the Philippines have the second and third highest installed geothermal energy capacity in the world, after the United States",
      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Providing round-the-clock energy, using minimal space and considered a clean source of power \u2014 geothermal energy seems like an ideal option for countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, where the potential is high, and governments are seeking to transition away from highly polluting fossil fuels.",
      "Yet most of the potential of geothermal energy, created by harnessing heat produced by the earth from underground reservoirs of hot water to power turbines that generate electricity, remains untapped in these countries and across the world \u2014 as financial, regulatory and community roadblocks have stalled growth.",
      "More readily available financing and domestic regulatory changes are starting to address these barriers, but experts say more should be done to unlock the vast clean energy source trapped just beneath the Earth\u2019s surface.",
      "Countries with high geothermal potential \u2014 such as the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 are usually located close to tectonically active regions where hot water or steam is naturally carried to the Earth\u2019s surface through volcanic activity, or can be accessed by shallow drilling.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re essentially standing on our own sun, which we can get clean, reliable energy from,\u201d said Marit Brommer, CEO of the International Geothermal Association based in Germany.",
      "Experts also laud geothermal plants for their ability to operate continuously to meet the minimum level of power demanded around-the-clock, unaffected by weather, with long lifespans and minimal maintenance.",
      "As countries shift towards renewable and cleaner energy, geothermal use is expected to grow: In Southeast Asia, geothermal power generation is expected to increase tenfold from 2020 to 2050, reaching 276 million megawatt-hours, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "With their steaming volcanoes and bubbling lakes, Indonesia and the Philippines \u2014 two archipelagic Southeast Asian countries located on the seismically active \u201cRing of Fire\u201d \u2014 are the second and third-largest users of geothermal energy in the world, with some of the highest geothermal energy potential. The U.S. is number one.",
      "Yet Indonesia uses less a tenth of its gargantuan reserves, making up 6% of its power supply. In the Philippines, about 8% of geothermal capacity has been developed, constituting 14.6% of the country's energy use, the country's largest source of renewable energy.",
      "Both countries plan to expand use of geothermal energy as they transition away from fossil fuels: Indonesia aims to increase the share of geothermal power generation by at least 8% by 2030, making it the second-largest renewable energy source after hydropower. The Philippine government is targeting several projects to boost geothermal capacity by adding nearly 1.5 gigawatts, nearly doubling its current use.",
      "But the exploratory stage of geothermal development \u2014 when companies do tests and drilling to confirm the size, temperature, pressure, and potential production rates of sites \u2014 is expensive and risky. That makes it hard to attract finance for development, said Shigeru Yamamura, an energy specialist at the Asia Development Bank.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the most difficult part of developers, because (financially) they cannot take 100% of the exploration risk themselves,\u201d Yamamura told The Associated Press.",
      "Climate finance for geothermal development is limited for most Southeast Asian nations, accounting for only 9% of finance available for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \u2014 a political and economic bloc of ten states in the region, which includes Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "A 2024 ASEAN energy report said \u201cblended finance\u201d using both public and private sources, grants and green bonds could help bridge the gap.",
      "The Philippine government has announced green energy auction schemes for geothermal energy and is preparing a \u201csmart green grid plan\u201d that prioritizes renewable energy \u2014 vital to enable private developers to get financing from banks. This signals progress in policy support for investment, Yamamura said.",
      "Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has focused on geothermal as part of the country's energy transition. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources says it's working to shorten permitting times and considering ways to increase rates of return on investments in geothermal projects. The state electric utility, Perusahaan Listrik Negara, also said it's committed to ramping up geothermal energy development.",
      "The World Bank is providing a $150 million loan to scale up Indonesian investments in geothermal energy by reducing the risks of early-stage exploration. The Green Climate Fund and the Clean Technology Fund are providing a $127.5 million.",
      "Even when finance is secured, community pushback can slow development.",
      "In Indonesia, residents of villages have protested projects, citing safety and environmental concerns: Several geothermal sites in Indonesia have had deadly gas leaks in the past five years.",
      "Some Indonesian communities don't understand what geothermal energy is and how they could benefit from its development, said Timothy Ravis, a doctoral student in global development at Cornell University.",
      "Protests at geothermal sites in the Philippines have led at least one company to pay royalties to Indigenous groups worried about land degradation caused by geothermal development.",
      "Governments and businesses should work to gain the consent of communities near projects to help ensure they succeed, said Brommer.",
      "\u201cWe need to show that this development benefits all people, not just a company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's not about being a good neighbor, it's about being the best neighbor and really working with communities to respect their concerns.\"",

    "summary": "The former president has shown he has no qualms about putting his most loyal confidants in his administration, no matter their baggage.",
    "story": [
      "\"Some candidates are just a bridge too far,\" one political scientist said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has shown no qualms about making or sticking by picks for his Cabinet no matter the baggage they carry -- even some accused of sexual assault.",
      "It's a far cry from the days when much smaller-scale scandals, such as marijuana use or hiring an undocumented worker as a nanny, sunk candidates put forward by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, experts said.",
      "\"We're in untested waters,\" Jonathan Hanson, a political scientist and lecturer in statistics at the University of Michigan's Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, told ABC News.",
      "Hanson and other experts said the public has become less concerned about some indiscretions, such as minor and one-time drug and alcohol arrests. Ronald Reagan's Supreme Court nominee Judge Douglas Ginsburg admitting to smoking pot when he was younger would never have gotten much negative blowback today, Hanson said.",
      "Two of Bill Clinton's picks for attorney general -- Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood -- both withdrew amid questions over their hiring immigrants in the country illegally as babysitters. Former Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle -- Clinton's choice for health and human services secretary -- had to bow out after it was revealed he didn't pay taxes for the use of a car and driver.",
      "\"It's true that people's standards have shifted, but the question is, when does it really cross a line?\" Hanson said.",
      "Trump's picks bring the debate to a new level, he argued.",
      "Trump himself campaigned in the shadow of his hush money felony criminal conviction and after a Manhattan civil jury found him liable for sexually abusing E. Jean Carroll. Trump has repeatedly denied the allegations in both cases.",
      "Matt Gaetz was already a controversial figure before his nomination while under a House Ethics Committee investigation for alleged sexual abuse and illicit drug use.",
      "The former Florida congressman has denied all the allegations and the investigations by the Justice Department ended with no charges being brought and the House Ethics Committee ended when Gaetz resigned from his seat.",
      "Trump's pick to head the Pentagon, Pete Hegseth, paid a woman who alleged he had sexually assaulted her in 2017, an accusation he denied and for which he was not charged.",
      "The New York Times published an email Friday that Hegseth's mother, Penelope Hegseth, sent him in 2018 in the context of his divorce from his second wife, saying he had routinely mistreated women for years.",
      "\"I have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,\" she wrote in the message, according to the Times.",
      "She said she later apologized and told the paper that she sent the e-mail in anger, adding \"I know my son. He is a good father, husband.\"",
      "The New Yorker reported Hegseth was allegedly forced to step down from two non-profits veterans' groups that he ran due to \"serious allegations of financial mismanagement, sexual impropriety, and personal misconduct.\" The magazine cited \"a trail of documents, corroborated by the accounts of former colleagues.\"",
      "ABC News has not independently confirmed The New Yorker or The New York Times reporting.",
      "Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for Hegseth, called the New Yorker piece, \"outlandish claims laundered ...by a petty and jealous disgruntled former associate,\" in a response to the magazine.",
      "Jason Miller, a senior Trump adviser, told CNN on Tuesday that the allegations in The New Yorker about Hegseth are \"innuendo and gossip,\" and said the Trump transition has no concerns about his pick to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "Hegseth has said the sex assault allegation from 2017 was \"fully investigated\" and that he was \"completely cleared\" although a police report did not say that. He has avoided talking about the allegations while he met with Republican lawmakers over the last couple of weeks to garner support.",
      "Hanson notes Trump named Gaetz and Hegseth after a majority of voters sent him back to the White House despite his own criminal indictments, including attempting to overturn the 2020 election. The sentencing for Trump's New York conviction has been postponed indefinitely while the federal cases have been dismissed.",
      "That, along with the Republicans taking control of Congress, Hanson said, might have motivated Trump to push forward with his controversial picks.",
      "\"It does raise the question if we are holding people to different standards than we used to,\" he said. \"There has been this notion to shrug it all off, thinking, 'Everyone is corrupt. At least he's open about it.'\"",
      "Edward Queen, a faculty member at Emory University Center for Ethics, said this thinking has been linked to what he said is growing distrust in the American political system.",
      "\"One of the consequences of the decline of trust is that everyone has done 'it' therefore 'it' doesn't matter. And that's disturbing,\" he told ABC News.",
      "At the same time, Hanson said, history shows the public traditionally has been against corruption, cronyism and other questionable behavior by public officials.",
      "\"There are voters in the middle who voted for Trump that would be unhappy for a vote for these troubling nominees,\" Hanson said. \"That will come back to hurt Republicans who may have ridden on his momentum.\"",
      "Jeff Spinner-Halev, the Kenan Eminent Professor of Political Ethics at the University of North Carolina, however, told ABC News that the general public has not kept up with the ins and outs of the confirmation process on Capitol Hill, and the outcry may not be that loud.",
      "\"It will have limited influence,\" he said of the public reaction. \"What will matter if a few senators are concerned about the controversies or competency of the candidate verses how much they care about the wrath of President Trump.\"",
      "The Senate must confirm each Cabinet choice, and while the GOP will have the majority, some Senate Republicans who back Trump also question whether his picks' ethical issues make them impossible to approve, according to Hanson.",
      "\"Putting my shoes in a senator's for a moment, they don't want to walk the plank for a vote,\" Hanson added. \"If they feel that a nominee is too unpopular, they don't want to stick their hand in the air and say 'yes' -- but if they do, he said, they would need to weigh the consequences of looking the other way.\"",
      "He sees the fact that some GOP senators signaled Gaetz wasn't acceptable as proof some standards still exist. For example, Gaetz withdrew his name from the nomination eight days after Trump announced it due to the increased scrutiny and more details about his scandals came to light.",
      "Gaetz said in a social media post that his nomination process would have been \"a distraction.\"",
      "\"No one was really looking to defend this guy, and the message got sent to the president-elect's team that this isn't going to work,\" Hanson said.",
      "\"I do think it is a positive sign because, at some point, lines were crossed. Some candidates are just a bridge too far, and it may be the case with some of the other appointees,\" he added.",
      "Steven Cheung, Trump's choice for White House communications director and campaign spokesman, reiterated his claim that \"voters gave President Trump a mandate to choose Cabinet nominees that reflect the will of the American people and he will continue to do so.\"",
      "\"President Trump appreciates the advice and consent of Senators on Capitol Hill, but ultimately this is his administration,\" he said in a statement after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Hanson predicted there will continue to be increased scrutiny of Trump's Cabinet picks as Senate confirmation hearings get closer, but he warned that the opposition might have limits.",
      "\"It depends on how much fight will come from Democrats and interest groups that engage with politics. It will be interesting to see what happens because there is plenty of opportunity here for Democrats in the Senate to make a lot of noise,\" he said.",
      "\"We will also be in a situation where there may be only enough clout and power to fight only the most controversial of nominees and let others pass,\" he said.",
      "Spinner-Halev said that Republican senators, in particular, may not want to cross Trump too many times and may just limit their opposition to his picks with the most baggage.",
      "\"One of the worries the Republicans will have is if a person [who is nominated] is incompetent,\" he said. \"The danger for the Trump administration and Republicans general is if these people are incompetent and mess up and then the public notices. This is what happened with George W. Bush and [Hurricane] Katrina where he said [FEMA Director Michael Brown] was doing a 'heck of a job.' That hurt him badly.\"",
      "Queen said there is a possibility that some Republican senators may put ethics before partisanship when all is said and done.",
      "\"It's not unreasonable to assume that there are a number of senators who realize there will be consequences of their choices and their decisions that it will be bad for the country as a whole,\" he said.",
      "In the long term, Hanson said it is unclear if Trump's selections will usher in a new norm of presidential picks who buck ethics and experience standards.",
      "He noted that American history has shown several cycles of reform brought on by demand of a public frustrated with dysfunction and improper behavior, such as in the aftermath of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.",
      "\"Now that they see what is happening, they may be reminded what the Trump presidency was like the first time around,\" he said of Americans who supported him. \"There may be a bunch of people who say this is not what I voted for, and that could affect things tremendously.\"",
      "Spinner-Halev said the future will depend on how informed the public is over the next four years.",
      "\"There is a lot that happens in Washington that's not in the public eye, and I think it's important that the public keeps an eye on the bureaucratic ongoings,\" he said.",

      "ABC News has reached out to the transition team to see if it intends to submit all Cabinet nominees for background checks.",
      "Though vetting of nominations has traditionally included an FBI background check, Republican senators are torn on whether one is 100% necessary for confirmation.",

He formally announced his intentions in a video released Wednesday morning but discussed his future before that with The Associated Press. He hopes to succeed popular Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited under Michigan law.",
      "The mayor\u2019s decision comes in the midst of a reckoning for Democrats in Michigan, one of a handful of swing states that helped propel former President Donald Trump to victory in November. The Democratic Party, which only two years previously had claimed a majority in both houses of the Legislature for the first time in decades, suffered setbacks at the ballot box that left state Democrats scrambling for explanations and a path forward.",
      "Still, few would have anticipated the mayor of the state\u2019s largest city and biggest Democratic stronghold abandoning his party altogether.",
      "Duggan said he felt he could govern more effectively as an independent.",
      "\u201cYou have a (state) legislature that\u2019s almost evenly divided that makes the stakes of each issue become magnified,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has gotten harder and harder to address things as the partisan climate has gotten more toxic.\"",
      "Duggan also could be looking to avoid what is shaping up as a crowded Democratic primary field. Among the potential contenders are Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist III and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who relocated to Michigan in 2022, has also sparked speculation about a potential Democratic gubernatorial bid. When asked by the AP on Nov. 3 about a potential candidacy, Buttigieg left the door open.",
      "On the Republican side, prospective candidates include Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former state Attorney General Mike Cox, former state Rep. Tom Leonard and U.S. Rep. John James. Tudor Dixon, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2022, is also considering another run.",
      "Gov. Whitmer\u2019s office and the state Democratic Party declined to comment Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis changes the dynamic of the campaigns for governor,\u201d said Adolph Mongo, a Detroit-based political commentator and former political consultant. \u201cThere have been rumblings from folks that we need a third party, a real one.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a gutsy move. This is a good move,\u201d Mongo continued. \u201cIt hurts the Democratic Party. There\u2019s no question that he is going to take a ton of Democrats with him. It\u2019s also going to free up those moderate Republican who are not buying MAGA.\u201d",
      "Democrat Mark Bernstein, a regent at the University of Michigan, also says running as an independent will allow Duggan \u201cto lead free from partisan entanglements that have paralyzed Lansing for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cVoters do not care about political parties. They care about results and Mayor Duggan gets results,\u201d Bernstein said.",
      "\u201cI do believe that many voters, like me, feel homeless, right now,\u201d Bernstein continued. \u201cMany Republicans feel estranged from the Republican Party and many Democrats feel alienated by the Democratic Party.\u201d",
      "Republican and former Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said on X that Duggan checks the boxes of being a \u201ccredible, independent candidate with the ability to raise money.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there are huge advantages of having a political party behind you,\u201d Calley wrote. \u201cAnd being a target of the left and the right will be intense. 2026 is already very interesting.\"",
      "A Duggan run as an independent, while it further fractures a state Democratic Party still reeling from Trump's win in November, could win over voters looking outside the party for answers.",
      "There is precedent. Then-U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona made the move in 2022 to independent. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin did the same last spring. Several states have elected independent governors since 1990, Duggan noted, including Angus King in Maine, now a U.S. senator.",
      "But an independent has never served as Michigan governor and third-party candidates typically don\u2019t fare well in elections for the state\u2019s top seat. Libertarian Party candidate Mary Buzuma received a scant 0.9% of the vote in 2022.",
      "\u201cIf you think the two-party system is serving you well, you can vote for your Republican or Democratic candidate,\u201d Duggan said. \"But if you think the only way we can really change the quality of life in Michigan is a different way, I\u2019m going to give people the alternative, an independent who is going to go to Lansing and work with responsible leadership in both parties.\u201d",
      "Last month, Duggan announced that the coming year would be his last as Detroit's mayor. His current term ends in January 2026. Duggan said he then plans to \u201dgo to communities across the state that have been forgotten and sit in neighborhood restaurants and farmhouses and city centers and listen to people.\"",
      "Duggan spent about eight years as chief executive of the Detroit Medical Center. He served three years as Wayne County prosecutor and 14 years as deputy county executive.",
      "He was the top vote-getter in Detroit\u2019s 2013 mayoral primary despite running a write-in campaign due to a ballot challenge. Duggan, who is white, was elected in November 2013 to lead mostly Black Detroit which that summer was taken into the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history by a state-appointed manager.",
      "Long-term debt of $18 billion or more and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual budget deficits left Detroit broke and nearly broken. Crime was high and neighborhood blight was rampant. Unemployment and poverty rates were among the nation\u2019s highest.",
      "Taking office in January 2014, Duggan ran the city but initially had no control over spending. By that December, Detroit had emerged from bankruptcy with about $7 billion in debt erased or restructured.",
      "Over the past decade, Detroit routinely has had balanced city budgets and surpluses. Violent crime is down and neighborhoods mostly are cleaner. Detroit\u2019s population even increased slightly in 2023. It was the first uptick since the 1950s when 1.8 million people called the city home.",

      "U.S. Judge Mark Scarsi -- who was appointed by Donald Trump -- took aim at President Biden's suggestion that \"no reasonable person\" would find the charging decisions against his son fair, noting that the \"president's own attorney general and Department of Justice\" oversaw the case.",
      "\"In the President's estimation,\" Scarsi continued, \"this legion of federal civil servants, the undersigned included, are unreasonable people.\"",
      "\"The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States \u2026 but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history,\" Scarsi said.",
      "However, Scarsi concluded that the intent of the pardon was clear enough \u2013 even if the language in the pardon itself was potentially \"unconstitutional\" \u2013 and agreed to terminate the case once the court received the appropriate records from the Office of the Pardon Attorney.",

      "\"Plaintiff is thus entitled to judgment by default as if every item and paragraph of the complaint were supported by proper and sufficient evidence. Here, this means Plaintiff has established that Defendant violated the ORA by failing to either turn over responsive records or else notify Plaintiff of her decision to withhold some or all such records,\" said McBurney's decision, which ordered Willis to turn over any records and pay the attorney's fees for Judicial Watch.",
      "Donald Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia.

      "The magazine cited what it called a detailed seven-page whistleblower report -- compiled by multiple former C.V.A. employees -- stating that, at one point, Hegseth had to be restrained while drunk from joining the dancers on the stage of a Louisiana strip club, where he had brought his team. The report also says that Hegseth, who was married at the time, and other members of his management team sexually pursued the organization\u2019s female staffers, the magazine said.",
      "ABC News has not independently confirmed the magazine's account. Hegseth's attorney, Tim Parlatore, told The New Yorker the claims were \"outlandish.\"",
      "\"We're going to meet with every senator that wants to meet with us, across the board, and we welcome their advice as we go through the advice and consent process,\" Hegseth told reporters as he arrived for a second day of sitdowns with senators.",

      "He did not respond, including when asked by ABC's Elizabeth Schulze about GOP Sen. Joni Ernst saying she thinks he should have agreed to a background check.",
      "Trump's team came out in defense of Hegseth earlier Tuesday. Senior adviser Jason Miller, in an interview on CNN, attempted to brush off the allegations as \"innuendo and gossip.\"",
      "\"So, when it comes to Pete Hegseth, there aren't any concerns, and we feel very good about his positioning for being confirmed by the Senate,\" Miller said. \"Now we have to take the process very seriously.\"",

      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who stood by Hegseth as a \"great\" pick on Monday, had similarly suggested Hegseth could face headwinds.",
      "\"Obviously, if it's to a certain degree, people are not going to vote to confirm it,\" Tuberville said when asked about the allegations after their meeting. \"But what I know when I talk to him about what I've read, what I've studied and been around him, I'll vote for him.\"",
      "Many suggesting that he needs to come forward and address it.",
      "\"Well, these allegations that have come up just in the last 12 to 14 hours are a surprise to all of us, and so yes, he does need to address those because this was not something of which we were aware, nor was President Trump aware of them,\" said Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who met with Hegseth on Monday night with a group of senators.",
      "Asked about his ability to make it through the nomination process, Lummis said she hopes to meet with him one-on-one and deferred to how he addresses the new allegations.",
      "\"It depends on how he addresses the issues that have been raised,\" Lummis said. \"Some of the earlier issues that were raised about an incident in California I think were satisfactorily addressed and would not have interfered with his nomination, but some new things that have come to light in the last 12 to 14 hours are things he needs to address.\"",
      "\"I have read all the articles, I have seen all the allegations. And Mr. Hegseth is going to have to address it,\" Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said.",

      "One Black Southern Republican told ABC News, \"Why is every Black person given HUD?\" adding that it was \"the literal Black job of the administration.\"",
      "ABC News reached out to Trump\u2019s transition team for comment on his selections but did not get a reply.",
      "Six African Americans have served as HUD secretaries, including Robert Weaver, the first. His appointment in 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson also made him the first African American appointed to a Cabinet-level position.",
      "The first African American woman to serve in a presidential cabinet was Patricia Roberts Harris, who was the first African American Health and Human Services director and later HUD secretary. She served under President Jimmy Carter.",
      "Former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce was the only Black Cabinet official in the Ronald Reagan administration. Dr. Ben Carson at HUD was Trump's sole Black cabinet member in his first term.",
      "In mid-November, Carson posted that he was \"excited to speak with President Trump about how I will continue to advance the America First agenda, and I am meeting with him in the near future.\"",
      "\"However, contrary to reports, I will not be serving as the Surgeon General,\" he said.",
      "The departments of Treasury and Interior remain the only departments that have never had a Black secretary.",
      "Another key position Black conservatives believe needs to be filled by an African American is assistant to the president, a senior-level role within the White House. Trump previously appointed Omarosa Manigault Newman, a contestant on his \"The Apprentice\" TV series, as the sole Black assistant to the president.",
      "\"I do think if you're really talking about Black influence inside the White House, does Trump want his only legacy of having the only AP for two terms be Omarosa?\" one Black Republican strategist asked.",
      "After Newman's departure, Ja'Ron Smith served as a special assistant on legislative affairs before rising to deputy assistant to the president for domestic policy. Ashley Bell, a prominent Black Republican, served as a White House adviser on entrepreneurship and a regional administrator for the Small Business Administration. Bell's former boss is former SBA Administrator Linda McMahon, who Trump announced as his pick for the Department of Education. McMahon also is co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team.",
      "Some of the former president's most ardent defenders have grown restless with the lack of Black appointees, as Trump selected several others who would be firsts in those positions. If confirmed, Sen. Marco Rubio would be the first Hispanic secretary of state; Scott Bessent would be the first openly gay Treasury secretary; and Tulsi Gabbard will be the first Asian American and youngest-ever director of national intelligence.",
      "\"I can't tweet that we need more Black conservatives because the left will attack me saying it's a DEI hire,\" the southern Republican said.",
      "However, one Black Republican operative told ABC News it is still very early when it comes to appointments.",
      "\"The Republican Party has never really fallen into the category of 'representation matters.' Our strength comes from diversity, but that is not our bumper sticker slogan. We're not going to nominate Black folks for the sake of nominating Black people,\" the Republican operative said.",
      "The operative noted that Black Republicans have made strides in leadership across the country. Sen. Tim Scott will chair the National Republican Senatorial Committee; Rep. Byron Donald is speculated as possibly running for governor or U.S. Senate in Florida; and Winsome Sears is seeking to become the first Black female governor in the country in Virginia.",
      "Donalds on CNN last month took aim at President Joe Biden\u2019s focus on diversity within his administration when asked about the lack of diversity among Trump\u2019s nominees, saying \u201cif you look at how the Democrats filled Joe Biden's cabinet, they wanted to have a piece of every identity. But did they get the job done? Did they actually serve the interest of the American people?\"",
      "\"What Donald Trump's election is about, is bringing competency and reality back to D.C. in the White House, regardless of their race, regardless of their religion, regardless of their creed.\" the Florida congressman added.",
      "Although some Black leaders inside and out of politics are highly qualified, another barrier that Black conservatives face is added scrutiny because of their dual identity.",
      "Dedrick Asante-Muhammad, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a non-partisan organization that studies diversity in government and congressional staff, said that the Trump administration differs vastly from past Republican administrations.",
      "\"Trump isn't a traditional Republican, he doesn't use traditional Republican institutions in the same way that past presidential candidates have, so there isn't a kind of pipeline, long-term relations,\" Asante-Muhammad said.",
      "\"Being a part of Trumpworld isn't easy. It is almost a personal blacklist thing in the outside world. So it is risky, in my opinion, to be a part of this organization for Black people that may want to be a part of the cause, but it's not worth their bottom dollar,\" one Black Republican strategist added.",
      "\"When Black people are put underneath this microscope of being Trump-affiliated, they look past your color and you are public enemy number one,\" a Black Republican operative said.",
      "The Republican strategist said Black Republicans face a different set of expectations -- they don't necessarily thrive in spaces that are massively disruptive, such as the second Trump term.",
      "\"I don't think disruption really leans into our skillset the way things are currently set up, we have to play things a little bit differently. There's no Black Republican version of Matt Gatez. They don't last,\" the strategist added.",
      "\"Those of us who have survived and been there for years and made it work have done so by being steady, consistent, reliable, and trustworthy, \" the strategist said.",
      "The majority of Black Republicans who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that while the optics of Trump being surrounded by mostly white people aren't ideal, they believe if Trump delivers on a better economy, securing the border, Second Step Act, and judicial reform it could be transformative for the Black community, but they do want the former president to hire more Black conservatives.",

      "A groundbreaking figure in North Carolina politics will no longer serve as leader of state Senate Democrats",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- Dan Blue, a groundbreaking figure in North Carolina politics across more than 40 years, will no longer serve as leader of state Senate Democrats after over a decade and is being replaced by another Raleigh-area lawmaker.",
      "The Senate Democratic Caucus elected Sen. Sydney Batch as the minority leader entering the next two-year session, the caucus said in a news release Monday after it met privately.",
      "Batch, a family law attorney who first entered the General Assembly in 2019, succeeds Blue, who before the leadership election \u201cannounced his desire to decline another term\u201d as leader, the caucus release said.",
      "\u201cI am excited to pass the torch into the capable hands of Senator Batch,\u201d Blue said in the release. No details on the vote were released.",
      "Blue, 75, first joined the legislature in 1981 as a House member and 10 years later was elected North Carolina\u2019s first \u2014 and still only \u2014 Black House speaker. He held the position for four years until Republicans took over the chamber.",
      "He left the House following an unsuccessful run for the U.S. Senate in 2002. He returned to the House in 2006 and shifted to the Senate in 2009 \u2014 filling vacancies in both instances. In early 2014, Blue was elevated to the minority leader's post after then-Sen. Martin Nesbitt stepped aside due to an illness. Nesbitt died days later.",
      "As minority leader, Blue has been in the difficult position of finding ways to push back effectively against Republicans, who have held continuous control of the Senate since 2011. Through several years in the post \u2014 including most of 2023 and all of 2024 \u2014 the GOP has held veto-proof majorities in each General Assembly chamber.",
      "While referencing a \u201cnew chapter\u201d in caucus leadership, Batch praised Blue on Monday for \u201cbringing forth his many years of experience gained through a historic tenure in both chambers of the General Assembly to deliver results for the people of North Carolina.\u201d",
      "Blue, who was reelected to a Wake County Senate seat last month, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a text seeking comment.",
      "In the next two-year session starting in January, Republicans will continue to hold at least 30 of the 50 Senate seats. But barring changes in an unresolved district race, House Republicans will fall just short of veto-proof control in their chamber \u2014 giving more leverage to Democratic Gov.-elect Josh Stein and his legislative allies.",
      "Batch was first elected to the House in 2018 but lost a reelection bid two years later. In early 2021, she filled a Senate vacancy and was elected again in 2022 and last month. Batch is a breast cancer survivor who has spoken out on issues involving health care and support for abortion rights.",
      "Batch said the Democratic caucus \"remains focused on creating a North Carolina where every resident can build the life they want for their families and themselves, and we are ready to work to get North Carolina back on the right track.\u201d",
      "The Senate Democratic Caucus also on Monday reelected Sen. Jay Chaudhuri of Wake County as the minority whip.",
      "Separately on Monday, the House Democratic Caucus reelected Rep. Robert Reives of Chatham County for another two-year term as minority leader. Reives joined the House in early 2014 and was elected the Democrats' leader after the 2020 elections, succeeding then-Rep. Darren Jackson."

      "A judge\u2019s overturning of Wisconsin\u2019s 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 y...",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- A judge's overturning of Wisconsin's 13-year-old law that effectively ended collective bargaining for teachers and most state government employees has rekindled a battle over labor rights in a state where the first public sector unions were formed 65 years ago.",
      "But before unions head back to the bargaining table, more legal fights await. Here are five things to know about the law, the current challenge and what happens next:",
      "At its core, the battle is over whether tens of thousands of teachers, nurses, prison guards and other state government employees can bargain over their workplace conditions and salary.",
      "The law, known as Act 10, was enacted in 2011 and limits bargaining to only wage increases no greater than the inflation rate. That means that other issues, such as benefits, safety and working conditions, and vacations, are not negotiable.",
      "The law also requires every public sector union to vote annually on maintaining its own certification. In order to pass, at least 51% of each union's members must vote yes, not just 51% of those voting.",
      "Union members were also required to pay more for their benefits, which reduced their take home pay and effectively served as a pay cut.",
      "Supporters say the law has saved school districts and local governments billions of dollars. Opponents say the law has kneecapped unions that traditionally back Democrats and hurt workers' morale and income.",
      "Passage of the law helped ease the way for the Legislature in 2015 to approve a so-called right-to-work law that limited the power of private-sector unions.",
      "Then- Gov. Scott Walker introduced the proposal shortly after taking office in 2011. That sparked weeks of massive protests, a walkout by Democratic state senators in a failed attempt to block passage of the law, and recall elections targeting Walker and Republicans who voted for it.",
      "The fight thrust Wisconsin into the the center of the battle over union rights in the U.S. Walker rode the attention, survived the 2012 recall attempt and then mounted a campaign for president a few years later. He dropped out, though, in the fall of 2015 as Donald Trump's support grew.",
      "The battle lines then and now are largely the same. The law is opposed by Democrats and unions. It is supported by Republicans, conservative groups and powerful organizations like Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, the largest business lobbying group in Wisconsin.",
      "Numerous legal challenges have been filed challenging the law in state and federal courts. None of them succeeded until now.",
      "The latest challenge was filed last year by seven unions representing teachers and other public-sector workers and three individuals.",
      "This lawsuit alleges that Act 10\u2019s exemption of some police, firefighters and other public safety workers from the bargaining restrictions violates the Wisconsin Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee.",
      "A similar argument was made in a federal lawsuit alleging that Act 10 violated the equal protection guarantee in the U.S. Constitution. But a federal appeals court in 2013 said the state was free to draw a line between public safety and other unions, and the following year again ruled that the law was constitutional.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court in 2014 also upheld the law as constitutional, rejecting a lawsuit brought by teachers and Milwaukee public workers. That case raised different arguments than the current lawsuit. And in 2019, a federal judge rejected a lawsuit brought by two arms of the International Union of Operating Engineers that argued the law violates free speech and free association under the First Amendment.",
      "Walker, whose legacy is largely defined by his fight with the unions, called the ruling \u201cbrazen political activism.\u201d",
      "The judge who struck down the law, Dane County Circuit Judge Jacob Frost, was appointed by Wisconsin's current governor, Democrat Tony Evers. It also appears that Frost signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Republican leaders of the Legislature echoed Walker's comments, decrying the ruling and calling Frost an \u201cactivist.\u201d",
      "Evers called the decision \u201cgreat news\" and said, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed workers should have a seat at the table in decisions that affect their daily lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Unions applauded the ruling while conservative groups warned that undoing the law would dramatically increase costs on local governments, leading to service cuts and tax increases.",
      "The Legislature has appealed the case. That would typically send it to the state court of appeals, unless the unions ask the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take the case directly.",
      "Opponents of the law are anxious for the state Supreme Court to get the case while it is controlled 4-3 by liberal justices. An election in April will determine whether liberals maintain control or the court flips back to conservatives, who held sway there from before Act 10 was passed until 2023. The newly elected justice will start work next August.",
      "Even if the current court takes the case, it's unclear what justices would hear it.",
      "Justice Janet Protasiewicz, whose win last year gave liberals the majority, said during her campaign that she believes Act 10 is unconstitutional. She also said she would consider recusing herself from any case challenging the law. Protasiewicz participated in protests against the law and signed the petition to recall Walker.",
      "Conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn was Walker\u2019s chief legal counsel and had a role in drafting the Act 10 law. But during his successful run for the court in 2015, Hagedorn would not promise to recuse himself if a case challenging Act 10 came before the court."

      "Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump\u2019s first pick to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation\u2019s chief federal law enforcement officer.",

The misdemeanor was created by state lawmakers in 2020 following the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.",
      "Buen was convicted this year of reckless endangerment, a misdemeanor, in the Glass shooting, which drew national attention and prompted calls for police reform focused on crisis intervention.

The rules also bar the wearing of costumes or non-medical masks, use of offensive or abusive language and disruptive behavior. They also limit comments from individuals to four minutes and eliminate rebuttal comments.",
      "\u201cTo consider the American flag and the Constitution a prop when someone raises it is an insult to what the flag is, what the flag stands for and what this country is,\u201d resident Maryann Hennessey said at the meeting where the new rules were approved, MyCentralJersey reported.",
      "Council President Nishith Patel said the rules were \u201cnot about limiting free speech but about maintaining order and ensuring respectful, focused debates.\" He said members had seen how \"the theatrics and the grandstanding\u201d can overshadow the important issues residents face.",
      "Patel said the American flag and Constitution could be considered props \u201cwhen used performatively.\" But he said their true strength \u201clies in our commitment to the values that they represent \u2014 the freedom, the equality, and the justice \u2014 not in how they are displayed in a speech.\u201d",
      "One resident accused members of trying to stop people from mocking them and warned that the council would lose any lawsuit over the matter. After he waved an American flag and was warned several times, he was ordered removed, according to video of the meeting.",
      "The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression on Tuesday posted a clip of that exchange on social media, calling it \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warning the council that \u201cyou\u2019ll be hearing from FIRE.\u201d",
      "Several council members also expressed concern about the rules. Two of them voted against the ordinance, one waving a flag himself as he did so."

      "State and federal authorities in Louisiana celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious $330 million conservation project intended to revitalize one of the state's largest swamp ecosystems by reconnecting it with the Mississippi River",
      "GARYVILLE, La. -- Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands.",
      "The 176 square mile (456 square kilometers) Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second largest contiguous forest, a beloved state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds.",
      "Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost.",
      "State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp.",
      "\u201cThis is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be,\u201d said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006.",
      "Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: \u201cThe swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.\u201d",
      "The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 2000 cubic feet per second (57 cubic meters per second) to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 5.5 miles (9 kilometers) diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 45,000 acres (182 square kilometers) of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence \u2014 a natural phenomenon on Louisiana\u2019s fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction \u2014 and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University\u2019s wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added.",
      "\u201cAll of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.\u201d",
      "The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said.",
      "These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there's less healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe whole system has shifted.\u201d",
      "Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project\u2019s anticipated completion in 2028.",
      "Unlike the state\u2019s controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities.",
      "The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 18.5 miles (30 kilometers) levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 9,000 acres (36 square kilometers) of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds towards the diversion program.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest\" in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council.",
      "And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you\u2019re going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it\u2019s going to allow the levees to be more effective,\u201d said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Gulf Program senior director. \u201cThis is how we need to be thinking at large about what\u2019s possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature.\""

      "Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance",
      "SAN CARLOS, Ariz. -- After missing 40 days of school last year, Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school \u2014 and at home.",
      "When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his clothes. But Tommy's grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his friends carefully and to behave in class.",
      "He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have everything,\u201d said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. \u201cYou have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car.\u201d",
      "A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year.",
      "___",
      "This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.",
      "____",
      "Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students \u2014 a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press.",
      "Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average.",
      "Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools.",
      "History \"may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,\u201d said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation.",
      "The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches \u2014 school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school.",
      "Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said.",
      "Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said.",
      "\u201cYou feel better, you do better,\u201d Jones said. \"That\u2019s our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.\u201d",
      "In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% \u2014 an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs.",
      "\u201cAll these connections with the community and the tribe are what\u2019s making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,\u201d said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation.",
      "In three states \u2014 Alaska, Nebraska, and South Dakota \u2014 the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023.",
      "AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools.",
      "At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent.",
      "The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up \u2014 in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically.",
      "Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students\u2019 parents.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s illness. There\u2019s trauma,\u201d Montoya said. \u201cA lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.\u201d",
      "About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos.",
      "For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family\u2019s native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home, but says that\u2019s not always enough to instill fluency.",
      "Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program \u2014 a system that now promotes native language preservation \u2014 and they struggled academically.",
      "\u201cIt was sad to see with my own eyes,\u201d said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. \u201cIn Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.\u201d",
      "Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s inspired,\u201d Tenorio said. \u201cHe tells me every day what he learns.\u201d",
      "In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits.",
      "Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year.",
      "\u201cThe kids always want to go \u2014 they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited,\u201d said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren.",
      "Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option.",
      "\u201cI just told her that you need to be in school, because who is going to be supporting you?\u201d Curtis said. \u201cYou've got to do it on your own. You got to make something of yourself.\u201d",
      "The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said.",
      "\u201cEducation was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,\u201d she said. \u201cWe work to decolonize our school system.\u201d",

      "The AP reported in January that a U.S. Center for SafeSport investigation found that two-time Olympian Joanne Reid had been sexually harassed by a ski-wax technician from 2016 to 2021. Wax technicians play a critical role in biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing with target shooting.",
      "SafeSport suspended the wax tech for six months and put him on probation through December. U.S. Biathlon fired him from the team and ordered the audit.",
      "Investigators interviewed athletes, parents, coaches and staff, and studied U.S. Biathlon policies as part of the review. They also sent a confidential survey to 57 biathletes who have competed since 2020.",
      "The report found the U.S. Biathlon Association code of conduct failed to provide clear examples of prohibited behavior. There was also no way to file complaints online or anonymously, making it less likely people would come forward, it said.",
      "The survey showed that while 92% of male respondents said they felt comfortable raising concerns about athlete safety, only 52% of women did. Women were far more likely to say they feared negative consequences to their careers for reporting misconduct \u2014 57% compared to 8% of men.",

      "Many athletes interviewed said they feared retaliation for reporting abuse after what happened to Reid. Six months after SafeSport's investigation, U.S. Biathlon retroactively changed the criteria for being pre-qualified for the World Cup team \u2014 and Reid was bumped off. The change didn\u2019t affect the status of anyone else on the team.",

      "The complaint details a back and forth with the federal government after state election officials checked voter rolls against a list of people who identified themselves as noncitizens with the state's Department of Transportation. The vast majority of the 2,176 names had subsequently registered to vote or voted, meaning that some of those people could have become naturalized citizens in the lapsed time.",

But Pate's critics have said even those individuals might be wrongly identified as noncitizens since the DOT data has proven unreliable.",
      "The ACLU and ACLU of Iowa said in a statement that the state would be getting the information it needed from the federal government if it agreed not to misuse it.",
      "\u201cStudies, journalistic efforts, and repeated attempts by government officials in Iowa and nationally have found very few non-citizens who have voted, out of the many millions of people who vote,\" the statement said. \"This wasteful lawsuit isn\u2019t going to change that. State leaders should spend their time on actual problems that face our state.\u201d",

The Des Moines Register, based on preliminary information collected from 97 of the state's 99 counties, found at least 500 of the identified individuals proved their citizenship status and had their votes counted.",

      "For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion",
      "DETROIT -- For a second time, a Delaware judge has nullified a pay package that Tesla had awarded its CEO, Elon Musk, that once was valued at $56 billion.",
      "On Monday, Chancellor Kathaleen St. Jude McCormick turned aside a request from Musk's lawyers to reverse a ruling she announced in January that had thrown out the compensation plan. The judge ruled then that Musk effectively controlled Tesla's board and had engineered the outsize pay package during sham negotiations.",
      "Lawyers for a Tesla shareholder who sued to block the pay package contended that shareholders who had voted for the 10-year plan in 2018 had been given misleading and incomplete information.",
      "In their defense, Tesla's board members asserted that the shareholders who ratified the pay plan a second time in June had done so after receiving full disclosures, thereby curing all the problems the judge had cited in her January ruling. As a result, they argued, Musk deserved the pay package for having raised Tesla's market value by billions of dollars.",
      "McCormick rejected that argument. In her 103-page opinion, she ruled that under Delaware law, Tesla's lawyers had no grounds to reverse her January ruling \u201cbased on evidence they created after trial.\u201d",
      "On Monday night, Tesla posted on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that the company will appeal. The appeal would be filed with the Delaware Supreme Court, the only state appellate court Tesla can pursue. Experts say a ruling would likely come in less than a year.",
      "\u201cThe ruling, if not overturned, means that judges and plaintiffs' lawyers run Delaware companies rather than their rightful owners \u2014 the shareholders,\u201d Tesla argued.",
      "Later, on X, Musk unleashed a blistering attack on the judge, asserting that McCormick is \u201ca radical far left activist cosplaying as a judge.\u201d",
      "Legal authorities generally suggest that McCormick\u2019s ruling was sound and followed the law. Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said that in his view, McCormick was right to rule that after Tesla lost its case in the original trial, it created improper new evidence by asking shareholders to ratify the pay package a second time.",
      "Had she allowed such a claim, he said, it would cause a major shift in Delaware\u2019s laws against conflicts of interest given the unusually close relationship between Musk and Tesla\u2019s board.",
      "\u201cDelaware protects investors \u2014 that\u2019s what she did,\u201d said Elson, who has followed the court for more than three decades. \u201cJust because you\u2019re a \u2018superstar CEO\u2019 doesn\u2019t put you in a separate category.\u201d",
      "Elson said he thinks investors would be reluctant to put money into Delaware companies if there were exceptions to the law for \u201cspecial people.\u201d",
      "Elson said that in his opinion, the court is likely to uphold McCormick's ruling.",
      "Experts say no. Rulings on state laws are normally left to state courts. Brian Dunn, program director for the Institute of Compensation Studies at Cornell University, said it's been his experience that Tesla has no choice but to stay in the Delaware courts for this compensation package.",
      "The company could try to reconstitute the pay package and seek approval in Texas, where it may expect more friendlier judges. But Dunn, who has spent 40 years as an executive compensation consultant, said it's likely that some other shareholder would challenge the award in Texas because it's excessive compared with other CEOs' pay plans.",
      "\u201cIf they just want to turn around and deliver him $56 billion, I can't believe somebody wouldn't want to litigate it,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cIt's an unconscionable amount of money.\u201d",
      "Almost certainly. Tesla stock is trading at 15 times the exercise price of stock options in the current package in Delaware, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors. Tesla's share price has doubled in the past six months, Jonas wrote. At Monday\u2019s closing stock price, the Musk package is now worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, an executive data firm.",
      "And Musk has asked for a subsequent pay package that would give him 25% of Tesla's voting shares. Musk has said he is uncomfortable moving further into artificial intelligence with the company if he doesn't have 25% control. He currently holds about 13% of Tesla's outstanding shares."

      "Naresh Bhatt, 37, was indicted by a Prince William County grand jury and faces a charge of murder as well as a count of defiling a dead body, according to online court documents.",
      "The body of Mamta Bhatt, 28, has not been found. But investigators linked her DNA to the blood found in the couple's home, Manassas Park Police Chief Mario Lugo said Monday evening at a news conference.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, we believed that she was murdered,\" Lugo told reporters.",
      "Investigators conducted their first search warrant when Naresh Bhatt was home with the couple's baby and discovered blood in the bedroom as well as the bathroom, Lugo said.",
      "He added that evidence shows that Bhatt cut up his wife's body, which prompted the defiling charge.",
      "\u201cI feel we have a strong case for not having the body,\u201d Lugo said.",
      "Chief Public Defender Tracey Lenox did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking comment on the new charges against Bhatt, who is already in jail awaiting trial on separate charges in the case.",
      "The investigation has drawn international attention to the small northern Virginia community, where homicide cases are rare. The disappearance of Mamta Bhatt, a pediatric nurse, spurred community members and her family in Nepal to band together to try to figure out what happened.",
      "They posted on social media, hosted community events and held a rally. Within days, community members began to apply public pressure on her husband.",
      "Three weeks after her disappearance in late July, Naresh Bhatt was charged with a felony count of concealing a dead body and placed in jail, where he remains. A prosecutor had said in court over the summer that the amount of blood found in the home indicated injuries that were not survivable.",
      "The investigation continued in Mamta Bhatt's death. But in September, Lenox, the public defender, argued that Naresh Bhatt was still entitled to a speedy trial on the count of concealing a dead body. The trial on that charge was scheduled for next week.",
      "Bodiless murder cases are not unheard of, according to law enforcement experts. And while they can still be difficult to prosecute, they\u2019ve become easier in recent years because of new types of evidence, such as DNA, cellphone location information and surveillance cameras.",
      "Tad DiBiase is a former federal prosecutor and author of the 2014 book, \u201cNo-Body Homicide Cases: A Practical Guide to Investigating, Prosecuting and Winning Cases When the Victim is Missing.\u201d",

The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",
      "Chicago-based McDonald's wouldn't say Tuesday whether its sales have returned to normal levels in the affected regions. But it thanked U.S. regulators for their quick action and said it remains confident in its rigorous food-safety standards.",
      "McDonald's last major food-safety issue happened in 2018, when more than 500 people contracted an intestinal illness after eating its salads.",
      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",
      "\u201cWith kids, when you want to go out to eat, they want to go to McDonald\u2019s. They want to get a Happy Meal,\u201d West said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t trust it anymore.\u201d"

      "China has announced a ban on exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications",
      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",
      "After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called \u201centity list\u201d subject to strict export controls, China\u2019s Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China\u2019s \u201crights and interests.\u201d Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",
      "\u201cU.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China\u2019s related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,\u201d it said.",
      "The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year.",
      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",
      "The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.",

      "Trump's brief call was more celebratory than a prescriptive policy agenda, according to those attending the private GOP retreat, encouraging the senators to confirm his Cabinet nominees as they launch an agenda of tax cuts, deportations and other priorities.",
      "\"It was a love fest,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. \u201cThere was a real sense of unity in the room.\u201d",

      "Deamonte Kendrick, who raps as Yak Gotti, was acquitted of all charges and Shannon Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdicts came nearly two years after jury selection began and a year after opening statements in a trial plagued with problems.",
      "The original, sweeping indictment used song lyrics and social media posts as evidence and charged 28 people with conspiring to violate Georgia\u2019s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. Young Thug, a Grammy-winning artist whose real name is Jeffery Williams, was set free on probation after he pleaded guilty in October to gang, drug and gun charges.",
      "Kendrick and Stillwell were charged in a 2015 drive-by shooting outside an Atlanta barbershop that killed Donovan Thomas Jr., also known as \u201cBig Nut,\u201d who prosecutors said was in a rival gang. Stillwell also was charged with fatally shooting Shymel Drinks at a red light in 2022, allegedly in retaliation for the killings days earlier of two associates in a gang known as YSL, which prosecutors said was co-founded by Young Thug.",
      "Stillwell was sentenced to the 10-year maximum for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon previously convicted of a felony involving a gun, with credit for the two years he already served and the balance to be served on probation.",
      "Nine of the defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began, and four more pleaded guilty during the trial, in October. Charges against 12 others remain pending. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. That left Kendrick and Stillwell, both of whom were stabbed while in jail \u2014 Stillwell last year and Kendrick on Sunday.",
      "Tuesday's verdicts were a major setback for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. Critics had criticized her use of the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law, which she also used to bring charges against President-elect Donald Trump for his attempts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "\u201cWe always respect the verdict of a jury,\u201d said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesperson for Willis.",
      "Defense attorneys said the state relied on faulty evidence \u2014 song lyrics, cherry-picked social media posts and unreliable witness testimony \u2014 to create a misleading narrative about young men who turned to music to escape economic hardship and difficult pasts.",
      "The jury's decision left Kendrick\u2019s mom, Tasha Kendrick, in tears.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just thankful for a lot of things right now,\u201d she said. \u201cMy emotions are all over the place right now.\"",
      "Prosecutors said Williams and two others founded Young Slime Life in association with the national Bloods gang in 2012. The 33-year-old artist also has a record label called Young Stoner Life. Deamonte Kendrick is featured on two of the most popular songs from the label\u2019s compilation album Slime Language 2, \u201cTake It to Trial\u201d and \u201cSlatty,\u201d as well as Young Thug\u2019s \u201cSlime Sh-t,\" which prosecutors presented as evidence.",
      "Williams entered a risky \u201cblind\u201d plea \u2014 meaning he pleaded guilty without an agreement on his sentence \u2014 in October. Williams\u2019 lawyer said he felt like they were winning, but the rapper complained that sitting in court felt like \u201chell\u201d and wanted to go home to his family. Judge Paige Reese Whitaker let him out of jail on probation with tight restrictions, including a 10-year ban from metro Atlanta except for certain occasions.",
      "The trial shook Atlanta\u2019s rap scene. Williams grew up in an Atlanta housing project and became a highly successful artist who added his own melodic twist to the modern Southern trap sound he helped popularize.",
      "Fulton County Superior Court Judge Ural Glanville was removed from the case in July after he met with prosecutors and a state witness without defense attorneys present. Kendrick\u2019s attorney Doug Weinstein said defendants got a \u201cfair trial\u201d once Whitaker took over. Among other things, she reprimanded the prosecution for being disorganized and not sharing evidence.",
      "During closings, Stillwell\u2019s defense attorney Max Schardt sought to cast doubts on the gang investigators and other state witnesses. Several alleged YSL members testified they had lied to police to stay out of prison. Schardt said officers had threatened them with long prison sentences if they didn\u2019t say the right thing.",
      "Prosecutors said those witnesses were honest with police but lied on the stand, in front of the people they had \u201csnitched\u201d on.

      "While defendants did commit crimes in the past, Schardt said during closings, it was to make money for themselves in communities stripped of economic opportunity \u2014 not to advance a gang. And music let some of them move on.",
      "\u201cAs a whole, we know the struggles that these communities have had,\u201d Schardt said. \u201cA sad, tacit acceptance that it\u2019s either rap, prison or death.\u201d",

      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",

The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices.",

But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of \u201clife-altering gender-transition procedures.\u201d",
      "The law \u201cdraws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,\u201d Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief.",
      "While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",

      "But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response.",

    "story": [
      "Three rail operators will be renationalised by Labour next year, but the move is not expected to bring down fares for passengers travelling on these lines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she recognised that \"affordability is really important to people\" but that people were \"willing to pay for a good service\".",
      "It comes as the government confirmed South Western Railway will be renationalised in May 2025, C2C in July 2025, and Greater Anglia in autumn 2025, after Labour passed a law allowing it to do so.",
      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",
      "What does nationalise mean?",
      "The move is part of Labour's wider plans to renationalise rail services as operators' contracts either end or reach a break.",
      "Under the existing system, Britain's railway lines are run by train operating companies as franchises for a fixed length of time.",
      "Northern Ireland's rail system has remained nationalised since 1948.",
      "The Passenger Railway Services (Public Ownership) Act 2024, which passed last week, allows the government to act on its manifesto promise to take rail contracts back into public ownership in five years as each private franchise runs out.",
      "The government also plans to set up a new arms-length body, Great British Railways (GBR), which will take over service contracts currently held by private firms as they expire in the coming years.",
      "It wants GBR to take over responsibility for maintaining and improving rail infrastructure from Network Rail eventually.",
      "What will it mean for train ticket prices?",
      "Rail fares are due to rise by 4.6% from March as set out in the recent Budget, a figure that the transport secretary repeated when asked if tickets will get cheaper with public ownership.",
      "She described this as \"the lowest absolute increase for the last three years\".",
      "Ms Alexander added that it while people may be willing to pay more for a \"really good\" service, including at evenings and weekends, performance had to improve.",
      "The transport department said that renationalisation would improve reliability, boost economic growth, and save \u00a3150m per year in fees.",
      "\"We need to bring these train companies into public ownership, and so we want to turn the page on 30 years of failure,\" Ms Alexander told BBC Breakfast.",
      "\"The primary aim of this is to improve reliability and clamp down on the delays, the cancellation, the waste and the inefficiency that we've seen,\" she said.",
      "Giving the example of LNER, she said that the department has \"reduced the number of trains that are cancelled due to staff shortages to basically zero\".",
      "However, Rail Partners, which represents private train firms, said Labour has \"parked the big decisions\" on how to fix the railways.",
      "\"Simply changing who runs the trains won\u2019t deliver more reliable and affordable services for passengers, reduce subsidy for taxpayers, or grow rail freight,\" said chief executive Andy Bagnall.",

      "Northern boss admits service 'unacceptable'",
      "Rail firm restores axed Manchester to Leeds trains",
      "Responsibility for running train services was handed to private companies during the 1990s, and since then there has been a boom in rail usage.",
      "But a number have faced criticism over both fares and reliability, with critics saying privatisation has led to an inefficient and fragmented system.",
      "During the coronavirus pandemic, the government in effect took control of much of the railways.",
      "Several train companies in England moved onto contracts where they get a fixed fee to run services, and the taxpayer carries the financial risk.",

      "Luxury car maker Jaguar has unveiled its new electric concept car and, like a recent controversial teaser video, it has divided opinion.",
      "Some on social media said the new Type 00 car was \"exciting\" and \"absolutely stunning\", while others called it \"rubbish\" and told Jaguar's designers to \"go back to the drawing board\".",
      "However, the carmaker has suggested the reaction is exactly what it wanted, as it tries to reset its brand to revive sluggish sales.",
      "\"Jaguar needs to be bold and disruptive in order to cut through and get our message across,\" boss Rawdon Glover told the BBC.",

      "Others criticised the change to Jaguar's iconic growling cat badge, which has been altered and no longer appears on the front of the car.",
      "Mr Glover has defended the effort, saying the debate helped to draw \"more eyeballs\" to the firm for this week's unveiling of the new concept car.",
      "\"In that context... the strategy was successful,\" he said.",
      "\"We absolutely don't want to ostracize any of our customer base ... But, as I say, [the] most important thing for us is we need to attract a new audience to Jaguar's brand to make sure that we are safeguarding the next 90 years of Jaguar's future.\"",

      "JLR halts UK Jaguar sales before electric relaunch",
      "JLR announced the transition to electric vehicles in 2021, keeping all of its three British plants open as part of the strategy.",

      "The Type 00 model unveiled at a Miami art fair is a concept car and so will not go into production for sale to the public.",
      "Instead, the vehicle, which features an ultra-long bonnet and big wheels, gives a pointer to the direction of the brand's new models.",
      "Mr Glover said Jaguar had \"ripped up the rulebook\" with the new design, which is also intended to evoke Jaguars past when the brand was in its heyday.",

      "But many on social media were nonplussed by the preview.",
      "James May, broadcaster and former presenter of Top Gear, said he was \"slightly disappointed\" by the design and its price.",
      "\"I wanted something more futuristic,\" he told the BBC. \"I mean, Jaguar have been saying they will copy nothing, but there's quite a bit of other concept cars in that new Jag.\"",
      "May said Jaguar cars had traditionally been \"very reasonably priced compared with, for example, Aston Martin\".",
      "\"So I'd like to see something more like half the price that they're toting at the moment.\"",
      "'Too big'",
      "Beatrix Keim, director at the Center of Automotive Research, said that Jaguar's concept car was \"too big, too unreal\".",
      "\"This is not the way to go,\" she said, given that there are already big cars in the market and \"electric cars cannot only be for the rich\".",
      "\"Of course, Jaguar is a luxury brand,\" she added. \"But I don't think that this is the direction which Jaguar at current point of time needs, because it's losing out on volume as well. And this is not a volume car.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Workers have fitted a reactor into the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for 30 years.",
      "Hundreds of engineers and construction staff worked for several days to lift the 500-tonne steel equipment into place at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset.",
      "\"It was a huge operation for all the teams involved,\" said Matt Abbott, who led the team installing it. \"This is the heart of the plant.\"",
      "The 13m-long (42.6 ft) unit is one of two reactors which will contain the nuclear chain reaction that will generate enough power for six million homes, when it opens in 2030.",
      "The giant steel cylinder was winched up the side of the reactor building in a 12-hour operation.",
      "It then had to be manoevered along rails through a giant equipment hatch, rotated through 90 degrees and lowered carefully onto a prepared base.",
      "It will stay there for 60 years of nuclear operation, and decades beyond.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it \"a major step forward\".",
      "He said: \u201cGetting Hinkley up and running to produce clean power for six million homes will be a win for our long-term energy independence.\"",
      "At least 12,000 people work there, alongside more than 100 cranes. The reactor will power 25m high steam generators, and drive turbines featuring the longest blades ever made.",
      "Yet the project has been delayed by political debates, the Covid pandemic and supply chain problems.",
      "It is now due to open five years later than originally planned. The estimated cost has risen to \u00a346bn from the \u00a318bn predicted in 2017.",
      "Nonetheless, installing the reactor is a significant milestone.",
      "So how does it work, who made it, and when will they switch it on?",
      "How does it work?",
      "The reactor is known as \"the heart of Hinkley\".",
      "It will contain radioactive uranium split by nuclear fission, in a chain reaction which generates a lot of heat.",

      "The steel vessel is 25cm thick, 13m (42.6 ft) long, and weighs 500 tonnes.",
      "A closed loop of pressurised water will pass round the reactor, and heat up.",
      "This heat will then be exchanged with a second loop of water, which turns into steam. The steam will drive turbines which generate Hinkley's electricity.",
      "Mr Abbott said: ''We\u2019ve got two of these reactors, and each should power about three million homes. So it\u2019s a massive deal and this is now the start of that journey for us.\"",

      "\u201cThe last nuclear reactor that was built was finished in 1991,\" Ian Henderson, head of Framatome UK.",
      "\"In that time that skill base has disappeared.\"",
      "The firm is now trying to change that.",
      "At a brand new factory in Avonmouth, near Bristol, they are training high-level welders and fitters to the exacting standards of the nuclear industry.",
      "For Hinkley C, they are fabricating tanks and other structures. But on future nuclear projects, they hope to take on more sophisticated jobs.",
      "Mr Henderson explained: \"It's taken quite a few years to build those skills up to where they are today, and we want to keep that going, keep investing.\u201d",
      "When will they switch it on?",

      "In fact, 2017 was the year M. de Rivaz left EDF. In Somerset, work had only just begun.",
      "As the first concrete was poured, the company said they would switch it on by 2025.",
      "But that was followed by global pandemic, a war in Ukraine and disruption to global supply chains.",
      "Now, the company expects to begin power generation by \"the end of the decade\".",

    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",

      "3. Cut out the confusion",
      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

      "She juggles her job with being a mother of five - which is \u201creally hard\u201d.",
      "When Sophie had her fifth child by Caesarean, she was told she needed bed rest for six weeks. But she says that wasn\u2019t an option, and she went back to work immediately.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t afford to stop because I needed the money.\u201d",
      "Her life would have been much easier had she had a right to maternity leave, paid by her employer.",
      "Under a new law in Belgium - the first of its kind in the world - this will now be the case. Sex workers will be entitled to official employment contracts, health insurance, pensions, maternity leave and sick days. Essentially, it will be treated like any other job.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for us to exist as people,\u201d Sophie says.",
      "There are tens of millions of sex workers worldwide. Sex work was decriminalised in Belgium in 2022 and is legal in several countries including Germany, Greece, the Netherlands and Turkey. But establishing employment rights and contracts is a global first.",
      "\u201cThis is radical, and it\u2019s the best step we have seen anywhere in the world so far,\u201d says Erin Kilbride, a researcher at Human Rights Watch. \u201cWe need every country to be moving in that direction.\u201d",
      "Critics say the trade causes trafficking, exploitation and abuse - which this law will not prevent.",
      "\u201cIt is dangerous because it normalises a profession that is always violent at its core,\u201d says Julia Crumi\u00e8re, a volunteer with Isala - an NGO that helps sex workers on the streets in Belgium.",
      "For many sex workers, the job is a necessity, and the law could not come soon enough.",
      "Mel was horrified when she was forced to give a client oral sex without a condom, when she knew a sexually transmitted infection (STI) was going round the brothel. But she felt she had no option.",
      "\u201cMy choice was either to spread the disease, or make no money.\u201d",
      "She had become an escort when she was 23 - she needed money, and quickly started earning beyond expectations. She thought she had struck gold, but the experience with the STI brought her sharply back to earth.",
      "Mel will now be able to refuse any client or sexual act she feels uncomfortable with - meaning she could have handled that situation differently.",
      "\u201cI could have pointed the finger at my madam [employer] and said: \u2018You're violating these terms and this is how you should treat me.\u2019 I would have been legally protected.\u201d",
      "Belgium\u2019s decision to change the law was the result of months of protests in 2022, prompted by the lack of state support during the Covid pandemic.",
      "One of those at the forefront was Victoria, president of the Belgian Union of Sex Workers (UTSOPI) and previously an escort for 12 years.",
      "For her, it was a personal fight. Victoria regards prostitution as a social service, with sex being only about 10% of what she does.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s giving people attention, listening to their stories, eating cake with them, dancing to waltz music,\u201d she explains. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s about loneliness.\u201d",
      "But the illegality of her job before 2022 raised significant challenges. She worked in unsafe conditions, with no choice over her clients and her agency taking a big cut of her earnings.",
      "In fact, Victoria says she was raped by a client who had become obsessed with her.",
      "She went to a police station, where she says the female officer was \u201cso hard\u201d on her.",
      "\"She told me sex workers can't be raped. She made me feel it was my fault, because I did that job.\u201d Victoria left the station crying.",
      "Every sex worker we spoke to told us that at some point they had been pressured to do something against their will.",
      "Because of that, Victoria fiercely believes this new law will improve their lives.",
      "\u201cIf there is no law and your job is illegal, there are no protocols to help you. This law gives people the tools to make us safer.\u201d",
      "Pimps who control sex work will be allowed to operate legally under the new law - provided they follow strict rules. Anyone who has been convicted of a serious crime will not be allowed to employ sex workers.",
      "\u201cI think many businesses will have to shut down, because a lot of employers have a criminal record,\u201d says Kris Reekmans. He and his wife Alexandra run a massage parlour on Love Street in the small town of Bekkevoort.",
      "The massages they offer clients include \u201ctantra\u201d and \u201cdouble pleasure\u201d.",

      "Kris and his wife employ 15 sex workers, and pride themselves on treating them with respect, protecting them and paying them good salaries.",
      "\u201cI hope the bad employers will be shut out and the good people, who want to do this profession honestly, will stay - and the more the better,\u201d he says.",
      "Erin Kilbride from Human Rights Watch is of similar mind - and says, by putting restrictions on employers, the new law will significantly \u201ccut away at the power they have over sex workers\u201d.",

      "\u201cIn what other job would you need a panic button? It\u2019s not the oldest profession in the world, it\u2019s the oldest exploitation in the world.\u201d",
      "How to regulate the sex industry remains a divisive issue globally. But for Mel, bringing it out of the shadows can only help women.",
      "\u201cI am very proud that Belgium is so far ahead,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a future now.\u201d",

    "summary": "Once restricted to only big cities, high-end specialty coffee chains are finding new customers across India.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",
      "\u201cI wasn't privy to that amount of information that would otherwise suggest that there was something deeper going on.\u201d",
      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",
      "But some managers lasted for more than a decade. And to do that, you had to have a \u201cfrontal lobotomy\u201d said Mr Brilliant.",
      "Some, he felt, were compromised and couldn\u2019t speak out. For the others, \u201cI think you had to just do what you were told to do, do it with a smile\u2026 No original thought, no willing to challenge the status quo, just willing to accept.\u201d",
      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",

    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Boeing, Nike and Starbucks have all changed their chief executives in recent months. But just how important is the person in the top job for the successful running of such huge companies?",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s only one cat who\u2019s on the hot seat,\u201d says Alan Lafley, who was CEO of global consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble from 2000 to 2010, and then again from 2013 to 2015.",
      "With P&G selling everything from Pampers nappies, to Head & Shoulders shampoo, and Fairy washing up liquid, it has more than five billion customers around the world. And its workforce now exceeds 107,000 people.",
      "Mr Lafley equates leading a firm of that vast size with being the manager of one of England\u2019s Premier League football teams. Specifically, he says the job comes with the same risk of being sacked if results are not as good as expected.",
      "\u201cWith the football players, if they have a bad season, they're not gone,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead it is the coach or manager that\u2019s going to go.\u201d",
      "Coffee giant Starbucks announced a change of CEO in August, following falling sales caused by factors including a complicated menu, tough competition in China, and boycotts linked to the war in the Middle East. The hope is that new boss Brian Niccol can transform the firm\u2019s fortunes.",
      "To lure him away from the success he was enjoying running US restaurant chain Chipotle, Starbucks is paying him more than $100m (\u00a379m) in his first year, plus the use of a private jet to allow him to commute 1,000 miles from his home in California to the firm\u2019s head office in Seattle, Washington state.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty obvious that there's a big hope for him and his ability to turn that company around,\u201d says executive coach Alisa Cohn, who explains that top pay packages are set by a company\u2019s board of directors, and reflect their expectations of the CEO they\u2019re appointing.",
      "Investors welcomed Mr Niccol\u2019s appointment  with a 24.5% jump in Starbucks share price the day it was announced. The same day Chipotle fell 7.5%.",
      "Mr Niccol is now continuing efforts to simplify Starbucks\u2019 menu.",
      "\u201cCEOs are the ones who are setting the strategy for the company,\u201d adds Ms Cohn. \u201cThey're the ones setting the culture for the company, and, truthfully, the buck stops with them in terms of their accountability.\u201d",
      "Marcia Kilgore is a Canadian entrepreneur behind skincare brands Soap & Glory and Beauty Pie, plus footwear firm Fitflop. She says that the role of CEO is complicated, demanding, and critical to a company\u2019s success.",
      "\u201cYou need to have somebody who can really look at the different streams of work that need to be done, and make those organised and prioritised,\u201d she adds.",
      "\u201cAnd someone who can make sure that the different teams in the company are working together harmoniously, and ensuring that time is not wasted, money is not wasted, and energy is not wasted on things that are not going to move the dial for the company.\u201d",
      "The failure to make the right choices and lead teams in the right direction was why Mr Lafley became the boss of P&G in 2000.",
      "His predecessor Durk Jager resigned as a result of the failure of a huge global restructuring that he led. Cutting 15,000 jobs and 10 factories was meant to increase profits, but instead led to repeated profit warnings and a steep share price collapse.",
      "Mr Lafley says that as CEO it\u2019s not about doing everything yourself, but \u201cenabling and empowering everybody in the organisation\u201d to do what needs to be done.",
      "\u201cWe had 100,000 people looking to the new CEO to tell them two things \u2013 \u2018what happened?\u2019, and \u2018what are we going to do next?\u2019.\u201d",
      "He explains that he decided to refocus the firm on serving customers and innovating new products, telling staff that \u201cI have confidence that we\u2019re all going to get us out of where we are and back on track\u201d.",
      "Mr Lafley adds that clearly communicating his plans with employees was so \u201chugely important\u201d that in those pre-Zoom days he flew around the world to meet staff in person.",
      "Inspiration and communication are also seemingly at the heart of the approach of new Nike CEO Elliott Hill. On getting the job in September he wrote to staff telling them he had \u201cgreat confidence in his team and our future together\u201d despite years of falling sales.",
      "Ms Cohn who has worked with companies including Google, Etsy and Johnson & Johnson says that whatever the plans of a new CEO, confidence is vital for any success.",
      "\u201cThe most important quality that you need to be the CEO is knowing that you will be able to be the CEO,\u201d she says. \u201cThere is a sense of confidence, and healthy ego that you need to bring to the table.",
      "\u201cThe second thing you need to bring to the table is an ability to adapt. You've got to be able to assess the situation, make some important decisions, and then adapt them as you go\u201d.",
      "It\u2019s not something she thinks can always be taught, which is why she says so many people get \"stuck\" at lower levels in a company. Ms Cohn adds: \u201cYou need to develop your own sort of internal state to know that you can handle the pressure, the difficulty, the spotlight\u201d.",
      "That pressure is one the reasons why top CEO\u2019s are often compensated with huge pay packages. When it comes to the S&P 500 group of the US\u2019s biggest companies last year, the top earner was Hock Tan at Broadcom who got $162m, followed by Nikesh Arora with $151m at cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks, and Stephen Schwarzman with $120m at investment giant Blackstone.",
      "The average for an S&P500 CEO last year was a record $16.3m, according to executive consultants Equilar. It means they are getting 196 times as much as the average worker at their companies and critics says CEO\u2019s aren\u2019t worth that much more than their staff.",
      "\u201cThis is based on the foolish notion that the person in the corner office is somehow almost single-handedly responsible for corporate value,\u201d says Sarah Anderson from the Washington based progressive think tank the Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "She think it\u2019s a problem that is getting worse, and spreading around the world.  \u201cI think runaway CEO pay is bad for our economy, bad for democracy and bad for business,\u201d she adds.",
      "Mr Lafley agrees that the ratio between staff and CEOs\u2019 pay is \u201ctoo high\u201d, but reasons that firms are having to compete to attract the best talent.",
      "He thinks the answer lies in paying CEOs \u201ca rather modest basic salary, and then everything else is incentive\u201d.",
      "\u201cIn the end, it's sort of like a coach. If you're not motivating people, and you're not enabling them to do what you're asking them to do, then you're not doing the job.\u201d",

      "\"You can charge a foreign student as much as they're willing to pay,\" says Ms Stephenson.",
      "Post-graduate fees are not capped either, so a master\u2019s degree at an elite university could cost \u00a350,000.",
      "Because undergraduate tuition fees for domestic students in England have not kept up with inflation, there has been a real-terms cut in university funding, says Ms Stephenson - with international students, in effect, subsidising the below-cost fees of home students.",
      "One whistleblower who worked at an education provider that prepares international students for university, told us agents would target families abroad who had the money to pay.",
      "The whistleblower - who has previously also spoken to the Sunday Times - said: \"We knew that those universities are increasingly desperate and would go along with our plans without much scrutiny into how those students were being found.",
      "\"No independent party is looking at the grades or the examinations. It's the Wild West, in a way.\"",
      "The whistleblower worked for Study Group, one of dozens of providers feeding the UK university system, and taking fees from students in the process.",
      "Based in the UK, Study Group is a registered provider which says it works for more than 50 universities with a network of 3,500 agents in 99 countries.",
      "Study Group strongly disputes the whistleblower's claims, saying overseas students earn their places on merit. It adds that any decision to admit a student on to a course is taken by the university, not Study Group, and rejects the claim that entry criteria are waived for any reason.",
      "It says courses it runs are robustly \"scrutinised by partner universities\".",
      "Yasmin paid \u00a316,000 for her course in international finance at a university in southern England. She later found out that of the 100 students on most of her modules, \"maybe 80 or 90 of them bought assignments\" from so-called \"essay mills\" based overseas. In England it is a criminal offence to complete work for a student which they can pass off as their own.",
      "When Yasmin told her tutor what was happening, he took no action. Yasmin says she now feels her master\u2019s degree has been \"devalued\".",
      "A Russell Group university professor, who has taught at several universities and wants to remain anonymous, echoes Yasmin's concerns. He tells File on 4 that 70% of his students at master\u2019s degree level over the past five years did not have sufficient English language skills to be on the course.",
      "\"There have certainly been occasions when very simple questions have not been able to be understood by students who I am teaching,\" he says.",
      "The professor told us he has had to adapt his teaching technique, and says students even use translation apps in class. But he insists fault does not lie with international students themselves, who are mostly trying their best, and says the situation varies from subject to subject.",
      "They pass, he says, because courses are often assessed through assignments, rather than exams. Some students use essay mills and pay for others to write their work or, increasingly, use artificial intelligence (AI). Both methods, he says, can defeat current anti-plagiarism software.",
      "UCU\u2019s Jo Grady says it is hardly surprising some students with poor English skills feel they need help from other people, or even use AI to do their work, as an \"act of desperation\".",
      "She says her members tell their managers that enrolling students without good English \"is a bad idea\u2026 they will struggle, and we will also struggle to teach them\". However, she says \"university managers and leaders pursue it regardless, because of the money and income it will bring in\".",
      "Some universities are in financial crisis, says Ms Grady, and have become dependent on high-fee paying overseas students who \"pay eye-watering sums of money\".",
      "\"Institutions are chasing money. They're not necessarily chasing the best candidates. And it's a corruption of what higher education should be.\"",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Drop in foreign student visas worrying for UK universities",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, rejects the suggestion some overseas students are being allowed on courses with poor English language skills as a way of boosting income.",
      "She says universities carry out strict checks on those they enrol - including minimum language levels, as set by the UK government.",
      "\"Students will need to be able to afford the fee to study in the UK, but beyond that it\u2019s a question of taking students who apply, and applying a merit-based criteria,\" she says. \"It is absolutely central that this is a system that people trust.\"",
      "Ms Stern says international students are attracted by the quality of the UK's universities and says it would be \"unwise\" to rely on international income to fund domestic education and research, because overseas student numbers could be affected by geopolitics or shifts in exchange rates.",
      "Meanwhile, international student numbers are falling. Data on UK student visa applications from the first half of this year shows there has been a 16% decline in applications, resulting in a loss of income for some institutions. This drop is, in part, being attributed to changes in UK student visa rules preventing most postgraduate students from bringing dependents.",
      "It is contributing to the worst financial crisis for universities since fees were first introduced. Last month, the government regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), estimated that by 2025-26, 72% of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in, and warned that \"rapid and decisive action is necessary\".",
      "The Department for Education told the BBC a reliance on overseas students has been identified as a risk, and many universities will have to change their business models, adding that the government is committed to managing migration carefully."

      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

      "Under BBC rules, presenters must reveal what they earn on an external events register, which is published by the corporation every quarter.",

      "Myrie has said he had not filled out the correct paperwork due to \"administrative issues\", and that he would not be taking part in any further paid external events beyond a handful he had already committed to.",
      "Writing on X, Myrie said: \"An apology \u2013 I\u2019ve had several administrative issues, and I didn\u2019t fill out the correct paperwork for some of my external public events, so they haven\u2019t been published until now.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 13:14:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Culture editor Katie Razzall explores what the allegations against the MasterChef host mean for the corporation.",
    "story": [
      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

      "BBC pulls MasterChef Christmas specials",
      "Wallace's response to MasterChef claims was misogynistic, says No 10",
      "The workplace review will aim to look at how to ensure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",
      "The Wallace story may be a wake-up call for the production sector. For years, we\u2019ve heard about junior staff feeling unable to speak truth to power in these sorts of scenarios.",
      "Now, some women are refusing to stay silent. If the sector doesn\u2019t get its house in order, it could be career limiting not just for high profile names but for executives as well.",

      "Pop star Raye, who has already enjoyed a record-breaking year, caps her achievements with a second consecutive nomination for best female.",

      "His record, Being Poor Is Expensive, is an emotionally gripping account of his childhood, which also earns the musician nominations for best male and best hip-hop act.",
      "The album of the year nominations are rounded out by Ghetts' similarly autobiographical On Purpose, With Purpose; Sampha's Lahai, a musing on fatherhood inspired by his young daughter; and West London rapper Skrapz's densely-packed Reflections - his first ever top 10 release.",

      "The singer/rapper said his latest track is \"not just a song\" but \"a statement\".",
      "The video begins with the Grammy-winning star declaring live on ITV's Good Morning Britain programme that \"African problems need to be solved by Africans\".",
      "It follows Ed Sheeran saying last month that Band Aid had not asked for permission to re-use his vocals from a 30th anniversary version of their track. He then credited Fuse ODG, who had declined the offer to take part in the project, for updating his view of the situation.",
      "Sheeran said: \"A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed, eloquently explained by @fuseodg\".",
      "Fuse ODG had posted: \"I refused to participate in Band Aid because I recognised the harm initiatives like it inflict on Africa.",
      "\"While they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa's economic growth, tourism, and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity.\"",
      "Fuse ODG won a Grammy for his collaborative work on Sheeran's 2017 song Bibia Be Ye Ye. Now his own latest music video features beautiful waterfalls and bustling cities, as well as making nods to famous black leaders including former Ghana president Kwame Nkrumah.",
      "Speaking about We Know It's Christmas (Band Aid Reply), the songwriter said it was intended as \"a reflection of where we\u2019ve come from and where we\u2019re going\".",
      "\"Ten years ago, I made a stand because I believed it was time for Africans to tell their own stories and to redefine the narrative,\" he said.",

      "\"This is about empowerment, pride, and showing the world that Africa\u2019s story is far more than poverty and aid.\"",
      "The release is an audiovisual response to the latest incarnation of Do They Know It's Christmas? - a charity song first written in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia.",
      "The new \"ultimate mix\" of the Band Aid single blends vocals from several versions of the charity single that have been recorded over the years, so that George Michael duets with Harry Styles, and Chris Martin harmonises with the Sugababes.",
      "Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley, who also sang on the original, told BBC Radio 2 that critics like Sheeran \"should shut up, to be honest.\"",
      "\"If you take that route, then nobody does anything to help anybody. So it's just nonsense...",

      "'Identity crisis'",
      "Speaking to the BBC Breakfast last month, Fuse ODG commented that while the original Band Aid project had been \"touching\" and well-intentioned, the lyrics and connected images were now having a damaging effect and stopping people from visiting Africa.",
      "\"It's been touching seeing the efforts that were put into it initially, the British public and different celebrities coming together to support a good cause, because there was a crisis at the time they needed attending to,\" he said.",
      "\"I have no problem with that, I think that was fantastic, and even just watching it back, I'm even getting emotional.\"",
      "\"But in that act of kindness, in that process of trying to help a crisis, we created another identity crisis,\" he continued.",
      "\"As a child who's now grown up in this era of images like that, Band Aid and initiatives like it have put Africa as a place of famine, a place of poverty, disease-filled.",
      "\"It took away our collective sense of pride and identity. So in the middle of trying to solve a temporary crisis, we've caused another dangerous crisis, which is an identity crisis for a whole continent.\"",
      "He went on to tell BBC Africa that despite having been \"excited\" initially to be invited to take part in the latest rendtion of star-studded charity track, that his over-arching \"mission\" as an artist was to \"realign how the world sees Africa and how Africans feel about themselves\".",

      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",

      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",

      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",

      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",

    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 02:40:03 GMT",
    "summary": "The musician says winning the Mercury Prize helped put an end to his \"desperate\" search for approval.",
    "story": [
      "When Michael Kiwanuka was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2020, he thought he knew the deal.",
      "He'd been up for the prestigious album award twice before. Like most artists, he said it was an honour to be nominated. A win would be nice, but not particularly life-changing.",
      "He was wrong.",
      "When Annie Mac ambushed him on The One Show to reveal it was third time lucky, a switch was flipped.",
      "\"It sort of woke me up,\" the singer-songwriter reveals.",
      "\"I'd been desperately looking for approval from my peers and certain [media] outlets - and the Mercury freed me from that desperation.",
      "\"It allowed me to feel that, actually, I just want to make the records that come naturally.\"",
      "The realisation was particularly powerful because his winning album, simply titled Kiwanuka, had grappled with his sense of inferiority as a musician, a black man, a partner and a friend.",
      "External validation didn't silence the voices in his head - but it gave him a healthy dose of perspective.",
      "\"When you have impostor syndrome and you\u2019re busy beating yourself up, you're actually using up all your energy doing that, as opposed to being like, 'Wow, how amazing it is to be making my own record?', or, 'How amazing that I'm playing the Pyramid Stage [at Glastonbury]?'",
      "\"The list is so long of how cool this job is, and I spent most of my time moaning. Winning the Mercury kicked off that feeling of, oh, I've got to sort this out.\"",
      "You could see that newfound freedom when he played at Glastonbury in June. Basking in the late afternoon sun, the 37-year-old took to the stage wearing a bright white kanzu robe - a traditional tunic from Uganda, where his parents are from.",
      "And when a malfunctioning synthesizer forced him to abort a performance of his new song Small Changes, the former perfectionist just laughed it off.",
      "\"I could hear my friend Joe laughing, and I sort of forgot I was on the Pyramid Stage,\" he recalls.",
      "\"A second later, I heard the crowd cheer, and it lifted me up off the ground.",
      "\"It was an amazing feeling. I felt like I had a massive battery pack from these people. I could do no wrong. Wherever I went, they would hold me up.\"",
      "Afterwards, the musician realised that one simple moment of fallibility had put the audience on his side.",
      "\"They saw the real me for a second, rather than what I thought people wanted to see,\" he reflects. \"It was really eye-opening.\"",
      "It\u2019s a little odd to hear the musician describe himself as a people pleaser.",
      "Since the release of his debut album Home Again in 2012, his music has worked in opposition to the trend-chasing virality of modern pop. His grooves are unhurried and thoughtful, his lyrics deeply introspective, and his inspirations - such as Isaac Hayes, Bill Withers and Marvin Gaye - decidedly old-school.",
      "His second album, Love & Hate, brought him to international attention after its opening track, Cold Little Heart, was picked to be the opening theme for hit TV show Big Little Lies,  starring Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman.",
      "Kiwanuka, released in 2019, earned him the Mercury Prize and his first Grammy Award nomination. But the densely-arranged, sumptuous soul often pushed his voice back in the mix \u2013 something he has confronted on his latest record, Small Changes.",
      "\"I fell in love with my voice again, which sounds weird,\" he says. \"But I realised being able to sing, and to have a voice that sounds good on recording, is a blessing.",
      "\"So I started to want that to be heard more than all the other stuff - the drums or the guitars or the strings. And that really aided the sound of the record.\"",
      "Chart battle",
      "The result is his smallest, most understated album to date. Aided once again by producers Inflo and Danger Mouse, he has created a suite of spacious, slow-burning confessionals that compel you to lean in and pay attention, slowly revealing their beauty on repeated listens.",
      "Reviews have been ecstatic. Awarding a score of 9/10, Uncut magazine called it \"rich, moving and inventive\", while Dork said the \"perfectly-balanced\" collection was \"genuine, gracious, and absolutely first-class\".",
      "The record is locked in a two-way battle for this week's UK number one album with Kendrick Lamar\u2019s surprise release GNX \u2013 but you get the impression Kiwunka won't pay too much attention to chart positions.",
      "For him, fulfilment came in the studio, surrounded by some of his favourite musicians -  including legendary bassist Pino Palladino and Janet Jackson\u2019s producer Jimmy Jam, who popped in to say hello and ended up contributing organ parts to half of the record.",
      "Each song is about a small change Kiwanuka has made in his life - confronting depression, rediscovering the innocence of childhood, and weathering the ups and downs of marriage.",
      "His languorous voice can tend towards the melancholy, but the lyrics are full of hope. \u201cSmall changes solve the problems,\u201d he sings on the title track.",
      "Despite that, the album was written during a period of major upheaval, as Kiwanuka moved away from London, became a father, and stared down the barrel of middle age.",
      "\"I realised, at the age of 37, it\u2019s the first time I can talk about something that happened 10 years ago, and I was still an adult,\" he laughs.",

      "\"Some friendships are full season, some friendships are forever, but one isn't more important than the other.",
      "\"And that song, Small Changes, I just loved the feeling of it when I wrote it in the studio.",
      "\"It sounded the way I felt about change - part hopeful, part excited, but also with the melancholy of realising that, sometimes change is hard and it's overwhelming and you've got no control over it.\"",
      "The power of commitment",
      "The biggest development is the arrival of two children \u2013 a change that's simultaneously \"given me wings\" and raised questions about his own priorities.",
      "\"I find that difficult,\" he admits. \"When you're 18, music is all-encompassing. You don't really care about anything else. Now there's something in my life that's more important \u2013 and sometimes you worry about keeping the work up to a standard.",

      "\"Commitment is a funny word,\" he says. \"It's not really that exciting, but it does a lot.",
      "\"I feel like, in this day and age, it's almost revolutionary to stick something through to the very end. And, actually, it can negate that worried feeling the world is giving us right now.",
      "\"The last five years have been crazy, but that idea of committing to someone, whatever happens, until they leave the planet, is becoming rare. But it's something I want to hold on to.\""

      "Eventually Ms Hill underwent a brain scan, which revealed a tiny benign growth.",
      "She then joined a pineal cyst support group, mainly consisting of young women, who believe such cysts are to blame for debilitating symptoms.",

      "Prof Santarius said: \u201cThe study showed that the treatment is effective and safe.",

      "\"Some of these abnormalities are quite common, but rarely cause any problems.",

      "\"In this case, pressure inside the head can rise, causing headache and very occasionally more serious problems.",
      "\"By and large surgeons will not offer surgery if this is not the case.",

    "story": [
      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain and Austria have all introduced assisted dying laws since 2015 \u2013 when UK MPs last voted on the issue \u2013 some allowing assisted death for those who are not terminally ill.",
      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "The US",
      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",
      "Loss of dignity - 234 patients (63.8%)Losing control of bodily functions - 171 (46.6%)Concern about being a burden on family and friends - 159 (43.3%)Inadequate pain control - 126 (34.3%)Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",

      "Inadequate pain control - 126 (34.3%)",
      "Financial implications of treatment - 30 (8.2%)",
      "In Oregon, as in other US states that permit assisted dying, the lethal medication must be self-administered - the same is proposed in England and Wales. Around one in three of those prescribed a lethal dose don\u2019t go ahead with it.",
      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",

What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",

      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has refused to give more information about why Louise Haigh resigned as transport secretary last week.",
      "Haigh stepped down after it emerged she had pleaded guilty to a fraud offence a decade ago, a conviction she reportedly told Sir Keir about in 2020, when he appointed her to his shadow cabinet.",
      "During Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch asked why the prime minister had appointed a \"convicted fraudster\" as his transport secretary.",
      "Sir Keir said Haigh had been right to resign \"when new information came to light\".",
      "But, when asked by Badenoch for details about the new information, he replied: \"I'm not going to disclose private information.\"",
      "He added that Haigh's swift resignation was a \"marked contrast\" to the behaviour of the previous Conservative government and accused Badenoch of being \"obsessed with the Westminster issues\".",
      "Badenoch said the prime minister was \"obfuscating\" and that he owed MPs \"an explanation\".",
      "\"The country needs conviction politicians not politicians with convictions,\" she said.",
      "Hitting back, Sir Keir said two of Badenoch's predecessors had \"convictions\", a reference to Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, who both received fixed penalty notices for breaking Covid rules.",
      "Fixed penalty notices are not classed as criminal convictions, provided the fine is paid on time.",
      "Later, responding to Badenoch's questions, a Labour source said: \u201cIf the Conservatives want to have a row about the extent of their criminality in office, that's fine by us.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that her two predecessors were found guilty of breaking the law, partying in Downing Street while telling everyone else to follow the rules, something which the leader of the opposition described just a few weeks ago as \u2018overblown\u2019. Maybe she'll want to retract that statement.\u201d",
      "Last week, Haigh became the first minister to resign since the Labour government took office in July.",
      "On Thursday evening, Sky News and The Times revealed details of her past conviction.",
      "Haigh subsequently issued a statement giving further details of the incident, which took place in 2013 when she was working for insurance company Aviva.",
      "She said she had reported a mugging to the police and that a work mobile phone was one of the items that had been stolen.",
      "She later said she found the handset in a drawer at home.",
      "Turning on the phone \"triggered police attention\", she said, and the matter was taken to magistrates' court for making a false report to police.",
      "Haigh said: \"Under the advice of my solicitor I pleaded guilty \u2013 despite the fact this was a genuine mistake from which I did not make any gain.\"",
      "She received a conditional discharge six months before becoming an MP in the 2015 general election.",
      "Early on Friday, the morning after the details of the conviction emerged, Haigh sent a resignation letter to the prime minister, saying she did not want to become a distraction.",
      "The BBC has been told by Whitehall sources that she had told Sir Keir about her conviction when he picked her to be in his shadow cabinet in 2020.",
      "She did not tell the government's propriety and ethics team about it when she became a member of the cabinet after Labour won July's general election.",
      "She believed it was sufficient to have disclosed her spent conviction to Sir Keir when Labour was in opposition, the BBC has been told.",
      "On Friday, a Downing Street spokesperson refused to say what Sir Keir knew about the conviction, only that he accepted her resignation after \"further information\" emerged.",
      "The spokesperson was questioned for 25 minutes on the issue but refused to give more details.",
      "A regular briefing with journalists after Wednesday\u2019s Prime Minister Questions was no different, with a Labour spokesperson present simply saying they would not get into \u201cprivate discussions with former cabinet ministers\u201d.",
      "However the BBC understands that some in Downing Street were unhappy Haigh had not run her explanation past them before releasing it to the media on Thursday and felt she should have told senior civil servants about the conviction on becoming a minister.",
      "On Wednesday, Badenoch's spokesperson said: \u201cIt's not good enough to say this is a private matter.\u201d",
      "\"Did he know about the criminal conviction and put her in the Cabinet anyway? Or did he not and that is why he fired her on Friday?",

      "They fear the algorithm used to calculate the targets has not taken into account strains on local infrastructure, land shortages, and a lack of capacity in the planning system and construction industry.",
      "The concerns are shared by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat authorities, according to BBC analysis of 90% of the consultation responses.",

      "She pointed to \u00a3500m of extra funding for new affordable homes announced in the Budget as an example of support the government was providing.",
      "Rayner was also asked about the resignation of Louise Haigh as transport secretary, after it emerged she pleaded guilty to a fraud offence a decade ago.",

      "Badenoch - the first black woman to lead a major UK political party - has previously said she would rather people focus on political issues than her ethnicity or sex.",
      "Asked if she was right and it was not a \"big deal\", Rayner said: \"Of course it's a big deal because I do think that women face barriers, and I think women of colour face barriers as well.\"",
      "However, she added that \"it doesn't also detract from the skills that a person has\".",
      "\"I often get described as left school at 16 without any qualifications, and there\u2019s so much more to me than being a woman or being working class.\"",
      "Asked if she would still be able to achieve what she has if she was a young person today in the face of struggling public services, stagnating wages and cost-of-living pressures, Rayner acknowledged it would be \"a challenge\" and \"you have to have a bit of luck\".",
      "But she said the government wanted to invest in state education \"so that people have those opportunities that I had\".",
      "Rayner added that as deputy prime minister she felt she had to do herself justice.",

      "Three rail operators will be renationalised by Labour next year, but the move is not expected to bring down fares for passengers travelling on these lines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she recognised that \"affordability is really important to people\" but that people were \"willing to pay for a good service\".",
      "It comes as the government confirmed South Western Railway will be renationalised in May 2025, C2C in July 2025, and Greater Anglia in autumn 2025, after Labour passed a law allowing it to do so.",
      "But some have criticised the plans, arguing that public ownership will not make much difference unless it is paired with fresh investment in the railways.",

    "story": [
      "A World War Two veteran has said she is \"angry\" and \"heartbroken\" after a meeting with a minister left her believing the government will not consider changing its policy of freezing the state pensions of some British citizens who live overseas.",
      "Anne Puckridge, who turns 100 this month, had travelled from her home in Canada to lobby the government.",
      "She is one of just over 453,000 British pensioners living abroad who do not get any annual rise in their state pension.",
      "Pensions Minister Emma Reynolds agreed to a meeting after a request to see Sir Keir Starmer was turned down due to \"pressures on his diary\".",
      "Following the meeting in Parliament, Ms Puckridge said she had been left feeling \"bitterly disappointed\" and \"disgusted\".",
      "She said she had got the impression Reynolds had been \"polite enough and kind enough to come in and spend her time with us but I think her mind was made up before we even started the meeting\".",
      "Ms Puckridge said she and her fellow campaigners would have to think \"very carefully about what we really can do from now\" although she added they would do something.",
      "Ms Reynolds said she thanked Ms Puckridge for the meeting and for sharing her experiences.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said the government understood that \"people move abroad for many reasons, and we provide clear information on how this can impact their finances in retirement \u2013 with the policy on the uprating of the UK state pension for recipients living overseas a longstanding one\".",
      "The spokesperson said the government was \"deeply proud of our veterans and their families for the contribution they make to our country\".",
      "Previous governments have rejected calls to uprate frozen pensions, citing the cost as a barrier.",
      "A source with knowledge of a previous government's approach suggested that unfreezing the pensions would not be as simple as it might appear and risked opening the door to legal challenges.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Ms Puckridge has received \u00a372.50 a week since she moved to Canada in 2001, at the age of 76, to be nearer her daughter.",
      "Her state pension is now less than half the \u00a3169.50 paid to pensioners still living in the UK.",
      "She told the BBC frozen pensions affect every aspect of life.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to be careful about entertainment,\" she said.",
      "\"You\u2019ve got to remember you can\u2019t be as kind to your grandchildren as you\u2019d like to be.",
      "\"You feel you\u2019ve lost all sense of dignity, the government has thrown you away, you know, out of sight out of mind.\"",
      "Ms Puckridge said when she informed the DWP she was moving to Canada \"they never said a word about [my] pension being frozen\".",
      "\"The first I knew about it was when my first raise was due,\" she said.",
      "\"I didn\u2019t get it. So I wrote and asked about it, and I was told no... you will receive no more from the day you left the UK, no more increases in pension.\"",
      "She added: \"It\u2019s the injustice of it that is so unfair, the fact that we were never warned.\"",
      "Under an arrangement called the triple lock, the UK state pension goes up each year by either 2.5%, inflation or earnings growth - whichever is the highest figure.",
      "Not all pensioners who move abroad have their pensions frozen.",
      "The UK has agreements in place with EU countries and the United States, among others, to continue increasing pensions in line with the amount received by UK residents.",
      "Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India are among the countries which do not have agreements.",
      "Campaigners say that creates an injustice.",
      "Patrick Edwards, who lives in Australia and is also part of the End Frozen Pensions campaign, said they had paid in like everyone else but were now being \"treated differently merely because of their address\".",
      "\"If they lived in many other countries around the world they\u2019d be getting the same as people in the UK but unfairly they\u2019ve been selected as having had their pensions frozen,\" he said.",
      "There is diplomatic pressure to change the policy too.",
      "The Canadian government is understood to have raised the issue with the new government already.",
      "The Australian government made repeated representations to the last government and a spokesperson said it would continue to raise it at \"appropriate opportunities\".",
      "There appears to be little disagreement that politically it is difficult to justify the different treatment of overseas pensioners between countries.",
      "The Institute for Economic Affairs think tank, which has often questioned the sustainability of the state pension, said: \"The government should always be trying to save money, but this does not look like a particularly principled way of doing so.\"",
      "However, previous governments have argued that individual pensioners would be unlikely to benefit overall, as many also get financial support from governments, like Canada and Australia, which would be reduced as a result.",
      "They have also cited the cost of fully restoring frozen pensions as a barrier.",
      "In 2019, the Conservative government estimated it would cost \u00a3600m to fully restore pensions to the level they would have been if they had not been frozen.",
      "The End Frozen Pensions Campaign says it only asking for pensions to increase from their current point.",
      "It estimates the cost would be \u00a355m in 2025/26.",

      "Ms Thorp had been unable to find out the identity of her stalker until he appeared in court.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Thorp said the \"right to know\" would have been crucial in relieving the \"psychological impact\" of her experience.",
      "\"Well-meaning police officers felt worried they were going to breach this guy's right to anonymity and GDPR - so he had his identity protected. I felt like a sitting duck - and I started to suspect everybody\".",

      "Under the new measures, Stalking Protection Orders - which can ban alleged stalkers from contacting or being within a certain distance of their victims - will be made more widely available, the government said.",
      "The changed approach will see courts able to impose these orders after a conviction even when one was not in place before a criminal trial, in a change to the current system - where one needs to have been issued beforehand.",

      "By the same date, unsafe cladding in buildings over 11 metres should either be fixed or have a date for completion, otherwise landlords will face penalties.",
      "Housing Secretary Angela Rayner said she was taking \"decisive action\" but campaigners said the proposals were \"extremely disappointing\" and would \"only make a horribly complicated process worse\".",
      "The drive to remove certain types of cladding from buildings was triggered by the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people.",
      "An inquiry into the tragedy found that the building's cladding, made from combustible material, was the \"principal\" reason for the fire's rapid spread.",
      "In the years since the fire, there have been efforts to remove similar materials from other tower blocks.",

      "However, earlier this year the UK's spending watchdog, the National Audit Office warned that this target would be missed unless the process was speeded up.",
      "It also estimated that up to 60% of buildings with dangerous cladding had still not been identified.",

      "It also says 29 developers, covering 95% of the buildings being fixed, have committed to \"more than doubling the rate at which they have been assessing and starting to fix unsafe buildings\".",

      "Last week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.",

      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",

      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

    "story": [
      "The most popular mobile games in the UK are being advertised without disclosing they contain loot boxes - random in-game purchases which critics say are \"exploitative\" and \"foster addiction\".",
      "The regulator, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), says it bans and removes ads which fail to make the clear whether or not a game contains a loot box.",
      "But a BBC investigation found only two of the top 45 highest-grossing games on the Google Play store actually followed those rules.",
      "Dr Jane Rigbye, chief executive of Young Gamers & Gamblers Education Trust (Ygam), called the findings \"deeply concerning\".",
      "\"In the absence of robust regulation in gaming, it is essential for games to provide clear and transparent information about their features, allowing both parents and gamers to make informed decisions,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the ASA said: \"This is an ongoing area of our work, and we\u2019re closely monitoring the sector to discover the scale of compliance and act accordingly.\"",

      "Trade body Ukie published guidance in July 2023, including the requirement to disclose loot boxes prior to games being purchased, which the industry was given a year to comply with.",
      "But, more than 12 months later, the BBC has discovered the vast majority of major mobile games containing loot boxes are still flouting the rules, with most games only disclosing their presence if would-be players tap a small information button on the Play Store.",
      "Adrian Hon, head of game developer Six to Start, said the games industry had a track record of \"conveniently ignoring or forgetting regulations that might interfere with their ability to sell to players\".",
      "\"We know that many people, including children, struggle with overspending on loot boxes,\" he said, adding they were deliberately designed to be \"habit-forming\".",
      "\"The least that games companies could do is disclose the presence of loot boxes, but they won't even do that - it's an indictment of their priorities and lack of care towards vulnerable players.\"",
      "Non-compliance",
      "The BBC checked the adverts for the top 45 highest grossing games on Google's Play Store, which along with Apple's App Store are where the vast majority of people access mobile games.",
      "Of those 45, 26 were labelled as including loot boxes - 22 of which were being actively advertised at the same time.",
      "However, only two of those titles spelt out the presence of the loot boxes in their ads.",
      "The highest-grossing game on the Play Store to contain loot boxes, Monopoly GO, was among those not to mention random in-game purchases in its adverts.",
      "The game has been downloaded more than 50 million times, generating more than $3bn (\u00a32.37bn) in revenue according to the IP's owner Hasbro.",

      "Just a fact of life these days.",
      "Widespread lay-offs and studio closures that rocked the industry last year have continued into 2024, and the rush of investment off the back of the Covid pandemic gaming boom has slowed down.",
      "There\u2019s also evidence people have been spending less money on new games, choosing to stick with long-running online games like Fortnite or yearly franchises including Call of Duty and EA Sports FC.",
      "Despite that, more games than ever are getting released.",
      "The UK's Digital Entertainment and Retail Association said in July that game sales had dropped sharply when compared with the same period last year.",
      "That's not only affected premium releases - smaller studios, whose games tend to be more affordable, have also struggled to find an audience.",
      "It's often difficult to pinpoint why, but quality isn't a guarantee of success.",
      "\"You can have the best marketing, you can have the best game, you can get rave reviews, but you're still flipping a coin as to whether it's going to blow up,\" Adam says.",
      "He feels \"discoverability\" - getting players to actually find your game - is one of the biggest challenges for indie developers.",
      "Steam, the main marketplace for PC gamers run by developer Valve, sells everything from games made in someone's bedroom to big-budget blockbusters made by teams of hundreds.",
      "There's a lot of competition.",
      "According to tracker SteamDB, more than 14,000 games have been published on the platform this year, with 2024 already overtaking 2023's tally.",
      "Adam's just added another to the total. He's released murder mystery adventure Loco Motive - a game he\u2019s been making with his brother for the last three years.",
      "He jokes that the best time to have put the game out was 2013 - when Steam wasn't quite so crowded.",
      "There are still ways to stand out - the platform recommends games based on users' playing habits and regularly runs promotions which push a curated selection of games on to homepages.",
      "But Adam admits it's tough.",
      "\"We're all competing for those same slots, and now we're competing with triple-A and other indies,\" says Adam.",
      "As well as battling for player's attention, new games are increasingly battling for their time.",
      "According to analytics firm Newzoo, annual series such as Call of Duty and online titles such as Fortnite took up 92% of gaming time, with just 8% remaining for new releases.",
      "Drawing players away from those established titles is extremely difficult.",
      "The failure of Sony\u2019s online shooter Concord - which the PlayStation maker killed  just two weeks after release - has been put down to its similarity to popular titles already on the market.",
      "Rhys Elliott, an analyst from Midia Research, suggests the big success stories of 2024 - Balatro, multiplayer shooter Helldivers II and \"Pok\u00e9mon with guns\" Palworld - did something new and interesting.",
      "But he accepts that's not the only ingredient.",
      "\"Factors like a strong IP, strong marketing campaign, community fostering, and timing can help, but the fact is that there is luck involved,\" he says.",
      "\"Right place, right time is a big part of gaming\u2019s surprise successes.",
      "\"But gameplay matters, and innovation, so great games often stand out and find their market.\"",
      "Another big issue for developers this year is finding funding.",
      "Investment in new projects has slowed down, leading some studios behind previous indie hits to step in and fill the gap.",
      "Among Us publisher Innersloth, for example, recently launched Outersloth - a fund to give developers a helping hand with getting their projects over the line.",
      "Husban Siddiqi was among the first group selected by the programme for his upcoming game Rogue Eclipse.",
      "He says Innersloth \"understand the struggles\" developers go through, and their support has been invaluable.",
      "But, even with the backing of an established studio, Husban isn't taking success for granted.",
      "\"It's unforgiving, the speed at which things change, the technology changes, the platforms change,\" he says.",
      "\"I always feel like we're trying to study as quickly as possible before some paradigm shift happens that kind of upends whatever that conventional thinking was.\"",
      "Manor Lords - a strategy game that puts players in charge of building a Medieval settlement.",
      "It's sold 2.5 million copies since its early access release in April.",
      "Snow Rui, co-founder of publisher Hooded Horse, puts the game's success down to the spin it puts on the genre by allowing players to inhabit and walk around the settlements they create.",
      "Manor Lords generated huge pre-release interest based on early trailers, but Snow admits that Hooded Horse was still surprised by its reception.",
      "\"It would almost be arrogant not to be taken aback by how successful it turned out to be,\" she says.",
      "Snow says one the best pieces of advice she got was \"don't roll too fast\" once you've found success.",
      "Some of the wider industry's problems have been blamed on companies expanding too quickly when gaming profits ballooned during the pandemic.",
      "Snow says it's more important to her to be sustainable over the long-term, and be realistic with your expectations.",
      "\"A breakout hit like this, you cannot count on it to repeat itself year after year,\" she says.",
      "\"There will be people pushing you to have a different expectation or treating the next year as a failure if the breakout hit doesn't repeat itself but that's simply not the case.",
      "\"So that's a matter of setting your expectations and centering who you are.\"",
      "Everyone would like to publish the next Manor Lords or the next Balatro, but Adam says \"success\" doesn't have to involve blockbuster-level sales for an indie.",
      "\"Our game doesn't cost that much to make, and because it's mostly been me and my brother and a few freelancers, the cost is not that high,\" he says.",
      "And, Adam says, it's about doing what you can to give your game the best chance -  Loco Motive's big marketing push was launched close to release to keep the momentum going.",
      "It might have paid off, as the game debuted in Steam's top-seller charts.",
      "The odds of making a breakout hit, or even breaking even at all, are low.",
      "But if there is a silver lining, Snow says development tools are becoming more accessible and opening the door to smaller teams with \"ingenious\" ideas.",
      "\"As a fan of games, this is something I'd love to see,\" she says.",
      "\"Even in the current environment, there's still plenty of room for fresh and innovative ideas.",
      "\"And that's something I look forward to for many years to come.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "The announcement",
      "On Tuesday night, at 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) President Yoon, seated in front of blue creaseless curtains, made an unexpected address to the nation.",
      "He said he was imposing martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. The embattled leader is in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and investigations into his cabinet members.",
      "What followed was a sleepless night for Seoul.",
      "Shortly after Yoon\u2019s announcement, police lined the white metal gates outside the National Assembly building in the heart of Seoul, the building that the country\u2019s tourism authorities have framed as \u201cthe symbol of Korean democracy\u201d.",
      "The military then announced that all parliamentary activity was suspended under martial law. But neither that nor the heavy security presence stopped thousands from gathering in front of the assembly in concern and fury.",
      "It is easy to forget that South Korea - now a vibrant democracy - had its last brush with authoritarianism in the not-too-distant past - it only emerged from military rule in 1987. Martial law was last imposed in 1979.",
      "This was \u201ca move I never expected to see in the 21st century in South Korea,\u201d university student Juye Hong told BBC World Service's OS programme from Seoul.",
      "The scramble",
      "Soon after Yoon's shock announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, hosted a live stream urging people to assemble at the National Assembly and protest there.",
      "He also asked  his fellow lawmakers to make their way to the assembly to vote down the order.",
      "Hundreds of South Koreans responded.",
      "Tensions rose quickly as a sea of dark, puffy winter coats pushed up against lines of police in neon jackets, chanting \u201cno to martial law\u201d.",

      "\"No words can express how afraid I am that things might turn out like North Korea for our people,\" a South Korean who did not want to be named told BBC OS.",
      "Meanwhile, word was spreading that special forces had been deployed to the assembly building. Helicopters were heard overhead as they circled the skies before landing on the parliament\u2019s roof.",
      "Reporters jostled in the crowd outside the gates, clicking away with their cameras.",
      "As concerns grew that the government might restrict the media, journalists in Seoul stayed in touch with one another, exchanging advice on how to stay safe.",
      "Ahn Gwi-ryeong, the 35-year-old spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Party found herself facing down soldiers at gunpoint. A video of the moment, where she is tugging at the barrel of a soldier's rifle, has since gone viral.",
      "\"I wasn't thinking about anything intellectual or rational, I was just like, \u2018We have to stop this, if we don't stop this, there's nothing else,\u2019\u2019 she told the BBC.",
      "\"To be honest, I was a bit scared at first when I first saw the martial law troops. I thought, \u2018Is this something that can happen in 21st century Korea, especially in the National Assembly?\"",
      "\"After such a storm last night, it was hard to get back to reality,\" she added, recalling the previous night.  \"I felt like I was witnessing the regression of history.\"",
      "As Ahn was confronting the soldiers, the clock was ticking for opposition lawmakers, who rushed to get into the assembly to block the order. Once that happened, the president would have to withdraw it.",
      "But first, MPs and their aides had to get inside. Some crawled through the legs of security forces, others shoved and screamed at armed soldiers; many frantically clambered over fences and walls.",
      "Lee Seong-yoon from the Democratic Party told the BBC that he had to scale a 1.5m (4.9ft)-high fence to enter the building, with the police blocking him even after he had shown them identification that proved he was a lawmaker.",

      "\u201cDemocracy is strong here,\u201d Hong said. \u201cThe military needs to listen to us, to the constitution, and not to the president.\u201d",
      "The vote",
      "Lawmakers who made it into the building huddled together, only slightly calmer than the people outside. Hastily, they barricaded the entrances with whatever they could find: cushioned benches, long tables, sofas.",
      "Some tried to push back soldiers who had made their way into the assembly building.",
      "By 01:00 local time, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-sik submitted a resolution requesting martial law to be lifted.",
      "With that, less than two hours after Yoon\u2019s shock declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon\u2019s party, voted unanimously to block it.",
      "After the vote, opposition leader Lee told reporters that this was \"a decisive opportunity to break the vicious cycle and return to normal society\".",
      "By 04:30, Yoon was back on TV, in front of the same blue curtains, saying he would withdraw martial law. But this would only be made official, he said, when he could assemble enough of his cabinet to lift the order.",
      "The announcement was met with cheers outside the assembly. In the hours before dawn, more people emerged from the building, from behind the barricades they had haphazardly put together.",
      "With holes in the doors and broken windows, the stately building already bears scars of the night when South Koreans saved their democracy.",
      "Schools, local businesses and banks opened as usual on Wednesday morning - and  flights continued to land uninterrupted in South Korea's buzzing capital.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 12:54:57 GMT",
    "summary": "Barnier, who has headed the French government since September, may be ousted - but what could happen next?",
    "story": [
      "What is happening in France?",
      "A vote of no-confidence in the government headed by Prime Minister Michel Barnier is taking place at the French National Assembly at around 19:00 (18:00 GMT).",
      "If - as expected - the vote goes through, the Barnier government will collapse.",
      "Barnier, the former EU Brexit chief negotiator, was picked by President Emmanuel Macron to be prime minister just 90 days ago.",
      "Macron, who is currently on a state visit to Saudi Arabia, has said he still believes the Barnier government can survive the vote. \"The country's interests are more important than those of the parties,\" he said.",
      "But the left-wing alliance New Popular Front (NFP) and Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) MPs already said they will cast their ballots against him, making it mathematically impossible for Barnier to remain in place.",
      "Why has this happened now?",
      "On Monday, Barnier used special powers to push his 2025 budget through without parliamentary support.",
      "He did so because he knew he had no chance to get the votes he needed from the opposition.",
      "Barnier's decision to use special powers to pass the budget angered both the NFP and the RN, both of which tabled no-confidence motions against him.",
      "Why did Barnier force through the budget?",
      "Barnier, 73, has been governing on borrowed time since the day he became prime minister in early September.",
      "This is because his appointment followed two months of political uncertainty sparked by inconclusive snap parliamentary elections, in which no party won enough seats to govern on its own.",
      "He therefore presided over a polarised National Assembly.",
      "His centrist party needed the support of at least one of the two big factions - the NFP or the National Rally (RN) - to pass legislation.",
      "The NFP, whose own candidate for prime minister was rejected by Macron in the summer, was furious Barnier was appointed and promised to always vote against him. It also deemed Barnier's budget - which included \u20ac60bn (\u00a349bn) in deficit reduction - unacceptable.",
      "So the RN's goodwill has been necessary for the government to stay in place.",
      "But when it came to the budget, and despite numerous concessions, the RN also said it would not endorse Barnier's bill.",
      "Barnier therefore had no choice but to invoke special powers to push the budget through.",
      "What happens next?",
      "On Tuesday night, Barnier made a last-ditch attempt on national TV to convince MPs not to vote him down, calling for MPs to vote \"beyond their political differences\" and for a \"common and superior interest\".",
      "However, it is expected that the motion will pass, leading to the collapse of the government. It would be the first time a French government has fallen to a no-confidence vote since 1962.",
      "In that case, Barnier will likely be asked to stay on as caretaker as Macron seeks a new prime minister.",
      "This proved difficult in the summer, when it took him two months to come up with a name that wouldn't immediately be shot down by one of the large parliamentary factions. The search for the next candidate could again take several weeks.",
      "To fill the vacuum Macron could also appoint an unelected technocrat government - but these are often short-lived as they struggle to be seen as legitimate.",
      "New elections are not an option as under the French constitution they cannot be called within a year of the previous polls, which took place last July.",
      "What does this mean for Macron?",
      "As president, Macron is elected in presidential elections every five years.",
      "But several sides are calling for Macron - who is due to remain in post until 2027 - to resign.",
      "But on Tuesday he made it clear he had no intention of doing this, saying that he would \"honour [the trust of the French people]... until the very last second of my term to serve the country.\"",

      "Nineteen-year-old Hwang was watching the protests in Georgia on Tuesday night's news when the images on TV suddenly changed - the spotlight was on his country after South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol announced martial law.",
      "\"I couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing,\" said the student, who wished to be identified only by his surname.",
      "By Wednesday afternoon, he was among the protesters standing before the National Assembly, still stunned about what had happened the night before.",
      "\"It's important for me to be here to show that we are against what Yoon tried to do,\" Hwang said.",
      "In a little less than six hours, Yoon was forced to walk back his shock announcement after lawmakers scrambled to block it.",
      "But those were chaotic hours, sparking protests, fear and uncertainty in the country that had elected him.",
      "The announcement",
      "On Tuesday night, at 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) President Yoon, seated in front of blue creaseless curtains, made an unexpected address to the nation.",
      "He said he was imposing martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. The embattled leader is in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and investigations into his cabinet members.",
      "What followed was a sleepless night for Seoul.",
      "Shortly after Yoon\u2019s announcement, police lined the white metal gates outside the National Assembly building in the heart of Seoul, the building that the country\u2019s tourism authorities have framed as \u201cthe symbol of Korean democracy\u201d.",
      "The military then announced that all parliamentary activity was suspended under martial law. But neither that nor the heavy security presence stopped thousands from gathering in front of the assembly in concern and fury.",
      "It is easy to forget that South Korea - now a vibrant democracy - had its last brush with authoritarianism in the not-too-distant past - it only emerged from military rule in 1987. Martial law was last imposed in 1979.",
      "This was \u201ca move I never expected to see in the 21st century in South Korea,\u201d university student Juye Hong told BBC World Service's OS programme from Seoul.",
      "The scramble",
      "Soon after Yoon's shock announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, hosted a live stream urging people to assemble at the National Assembly and protest there.",
      "He also asked  his fellow lawmakers to make their way to the assembly to vote down the order.",
      "Hundreds of South Koreans responded.",
      "Tensions rose quickly as a sea of dark, puffy winter coats pushed up against lines of police in neon jackets, chanting \u201cno to martial law\u201d.",
      "And as vehicles arrived with military units, crowds blocked them. One woman lay defiantly between the wheels of a vehicle.",
      "In stark contrast, there was a fa\u00e7ade of normalcy across the rest of Seoul. Still, confusion enveloped the city.",
      "\u201cThe streets look normal, people here are certainly bewildered,\u201d John Nilsson-Wright, an associate professor at the University of Cambridge, told BBC World Service from Seoul.",

      "How two hours of martial law chaos unfolded",
      "It was a sleepless night for some. \"At first I was excited at the thought of not going to school today,\" 15-year-old Kwon Hoo told the BBC in Seoul on Wednesday. \"But then overwhelmingly the sense of fear settled in, that kept me up all night.\"",
      "\"No words can express how afraid I am that things might turn out like North Korea for our people,\" a South Korean who did not want to be named told BBC OS.",
      "Meanwhile, word was spreading that special forces had been deployed to the assembly building. Helicopters were heard overhead as they circled the skies before landing on the parliament\u2019s roof.",
      "Reporters jostled in the crowd outside the gates, clicking away with their cameras.",
      "As concerns grew that the government might restrict the media, journalists in Seoul stayed in touch with one another, exchanging advice on how to stay safe.",
      "Ahn Gwi-ryeong, the 35-year-old spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Party found herself facing down soldiers at gunpoint. A video of the moment, where she is tugging at the barrel of a soldier's rifle, has since gone viral.",
      "\"I wasn't thinking about anything intellectual or rational, I was just like, \u2018We have to stop this, if we don't stop this, there's nothing else,\u2019\u2019 she told the BBC.",
      "\"To be honest, I was a bit scared at first when I first saw the martial law troops. I thought, \u2018Is this something that can happen in 21st century Korea, especially in the National Assembly?\"",
      "\"After such a storm last night, it was hard to get back to reality,\" she added, recalling the previous night.  \"I felt like I was witnessing the regression of history.\"",
      "As Ahn was confronting the soldiers, the clock was ticking for opposition lawmakers, who rushed to get into the assembly to block the order. Once that happened, the president would have to withdraw it.",
      "But first, MPs and their aides had to get inside. Some crawled through the legs of security forces, others shoved and screamed at armed soldiers; many frantically clambered over fences and walls.",
      "Lee Seong-yoon from the Democratic Party told the BBC that he had to scale a 1.5m (4.9ft)-high fence to enter the building, with the police blocking him even after he had shown them identification that proved he was a lawmaker.",
      "Another opposition MP, Hong Keewon, said that protesters helped to hoist him over the wall. He had been asleep when Yoon made the announcement - when his wife woke him, he raced to parliament.",
      "\u201cDemocracy is strong here,\u201d Hong said. \u201cThe military needs to listen to us, to the constitution, and not to the president.\u201d",
      "The vote",
      "Lawmakers who made it into the building huddled together, only slightly calmer than the people outside. Hastily, they barricaded the entrances with whatever they could find: cushioned benches, long tables, sofas.",
      "Some tried to push back soldiers who had made their way into the assembly building.",
      "By 01:00 local time, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-sik submitted a resolution requesting martial law to be lifted.",
      "With that, less than two hours after Yoon\u2019s shock declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon\u2019s party, voted unanimously to block it.",
      "After the vote, opposition leader Lee told reporters that this was \"a decisive opportunity to break the vicious cycle and return to normal society\".",
      "By 04:30, Yoon was back on TV, in front of the same blue curtains, saying he would withdraw martial law. But this would only be made official, he said, when he could assemble enough of his cabinet to lift the order.",
      "The announcement was met with cheers outside the assembly. In the hours before dawn, more people emerged from the building, from behind the barricades they had haphazardly put together.",
      "With holes in the doors and broken windows, the stately building already bears scars of the night when South Koreans saved their democracy.",
      "Schools, local businesses and banks opened as usual on Wednesday morning - and  flights continued to land uninterrupted in South Korea's buzzing capital.",
      "But public anger - and the political fallout - was not spent.",
      "As the sun rose on Wednesday, thousands gathered to call for Yoon's resignation. The president is also facing impeachment proceedings.",
      "\u201cWe are a strong democracy\u2026But Korean people want to be safe - President Yoon must resign or be impeached,\u201d Yang Bu-nam, a Democratic Party politician, told the BBC.",

    "story": [
      "Listen to Fergal read this article",
      "Listen to Fergal read this article",
      "Every single person in his platoon knew someone who was killed. Yuval Green, 26, knew at least three. He was a reservist, a medic in the paratroops of the Israel Defence Forces, when he heard the first news of the 7 October Hamas attack.",
      "\u201cIsrael is a small country. Everyone knows each other,\u201d he says. In several days of violence,1,200 people were killed, and 251 more abducted into Gaza. Ninety-seven hostages remain in Gaza, and around half of them are believed to be alive.",
      "Yuval immediately answered his country\u2019s call to arms. It was a mission to defend Israelis. He recalls the horror of entering devastated Jewish communities near the Gaza border. \u201cYou're seeing\u2026 dead bodies on the streets, seeing cars punctured by bullets.\u201d",
      "Back then, there was no doubt about reporting for duty. The country was under attack. The hostages had to be brought home.",
      "Then came the fighting in Gaza itself. Things seen that could not be unseen. Like the night he saw cats eating human remains in the roadway.",
      "\u201cStart to imagine, like an apocalypse. You look to your right, you look to your left, all you see is destroyed buildings, buildings that are damaged by fire, by missiles, everything. That's Gaza right now.\u201d",
      "One year on, the young man who reported for duty on 7 October is refusing to fight.",
      "Yuval is the co-organiser of a public letter signed by more than 165 - at the latest count - Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reservists, and a smaller number of permanent soldiers, refusing to serve, or threatening to refuse, unless the hostages are returned - something that would require a ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "In a country still traumatised by the worst violence in its history, those refusing for reasons of conscience are a minority in a military that includes around 465,000 reservists.",
      "There is another factor in play for some other IDF reservists: exhaustion.",
      "According to Israeli media reports, a growing number are failing to report for duty. The Times of Israel newspaper and several other outlets quoted military sources as saying that there was a drop of between 15% to 25% of troops showing up, mainly due to burnout with the long periods of service required of them.",
      "Even if there is not widespread public support for those refusing to serve because of reasons of conscience, there is evidence that some of the key demands of those who signed the refusal letter are shared by a growing number of Israelis.",
      "A recent opinion poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) indicated that among Jewish Israelis 45% wanted the war to end - with a ceasefire to bring the hostages home - against 43% who wanted the IDF to fight on to destroy Hamas.",
      "Significantly, the IDI poll also suggests that the sense of solidarity which marked the opening days of the war as the country reeled from the trauma of 7 October has been overtaken by the revival of political divisions: only 26% of Israelis believe there is now a sense of togetherness, while 44% say there is not.",
      "At least part of this has to do with a feeling often expressed, especially among those on the left of the political divide, that the war is being prolonged at the behest of far-right parties whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to remain in power.",
      "Even the former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanhayu\u2019s Likud Party, dismissed by the prime minister last month, cited the failure to return the hostages as one of the key disagreements with his boss.",
      "\u201cThere is and will not be any atonement for abandoning the captives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a mark of Cain on the forehead of Israeli society and those leading this mistaken path.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu, who along with Gallant is facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, has repeatedly denied this and stressed his commitment to freeing the hostages.",
      "The seeds of refusal",
      "The seeds of Yuval\u2019s refusal lie back in the days soon after the war began. Then the deputy speaker of the Knesset (Israel\u2019s parliament), Nissim Vaturi, called for the Gaza Strip to be \u201cerased from the face of the Earth\u201d. Prominent rabbi Eliyahu Mali, referring generally to Palestinians in Gaza, said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill them, they\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The rabbi stressed soldiers should only do what the army orders, and that the state law did not allow for the killing of the civilian population.",
      "But the language - by no means restricted to the two examples above - worried Yuval.",
      "\u201cPeople were speaking about killing the entire population of Gaza, as if it was some type of an academic idea that makes sense\u2026 And with this atmosphere, soldiers are entering Gaza just a month after their friends were butchered, hearing about soldiers dying every day. And soldiers do a lot of things.\u201d",
      "There have been social media posts from soldiers in Gaza abusing prisoners, destroying property, and mocking Palestinians, including numerous examples of soldiers posing with people\u2019s possessions - including womens\u2019 dresses and underwear.",
      "\u201cI was trying to fight that at the time as much as I could,\u201d says Yuval. \u201cThere was a lot of dehumanising, a vengeful atmosphere.\u201d",
      "His personal turning point came with an order he could not obey.",
      "\u201cThey told us to burn down a house, and I went to my commander and asked him: \u2018Why are we doing that?\u2019 And the answers he gave me were just not good enough. I wasn't willing to burn down a house without reasons that make sense, without knowing that this serves a certain military purpose, or any type of purpose. So I said no and left.\u201d",
      "That was his last day in Gaza.",
      "In response, the IDF told me that its actions were \u201cbased on military necessity, and with accordance to international law\u201d and said Hamas \u201cunlawfully embed their military assets in civilian areas\u201d.",
      "Three of the refusers have spoken to the BBC. Two agreed to give their names, while a third requested anonymity because he feared repercussions. All stress that they love their country, but the experience of the war, the failure to reach a hostage deal led to a defining moral choice.",
      "'People calmly talked about abuse or murder'",
      "One soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, was at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport when news started coming in about the Hamas attacks. He recalls feeling shock at first. Then a ringing sensation in his ears. \u201cI remember the drive home\u2026 The radio\u2019s on and people [are] calling in, saying: \u2018My dad was just kidnapped, help me. No-one's helping me.\u2019 It was truly a living nightmare.\u201d",
      "This was the moment the IDF was made for, he felt. It wasn\u2019t like making house raids in the occupied West Bank or chasing stone-throwing youths. \u201cProbably for the first time I felt like I enlisted in true self-defence.\u201d",
      "But his view transformed as the war progressed. \u201cI guess I no longer felt I could honestly say that this campaign was centered around securing the lives of Israelis.\u201d",
      "He says this was based on what he saw and heard among comrades. \u201cI try to have empathy and say, \u2018This is what happens to people who are torn apart by war\u2026\u2019 but it was hard to overlook how wide this discourse was.\u201d",
      "He recalls comrades boasting, even to their commanders, about beating \u201chelpless Palestinians\u201d. And he heard more chilling conversations. \u201cPeople would pretty calmly talk about cases of abuse or even murder, as if it was a technicality, or with real serenity. That obviously shocked me.\u201d",
      "The soldier also says he witnessed prisoners being blindfolded and not allowed to move \u201cfor basically their entire stay\u2026 and given amounts of food that were shocking\u201d.",
      "When his first tour of duty ended he vowed not to return.",
      "The IDF referred me to a statement from last May which said any abuse of detainees was strictly prohibited. It also said three meals a day were provided, \u201cof quantity and variety approved by a qualified nutritionist\u201d. It said handcuffing of detainees was only carried out \u201cwhere the security risk requires it\u201d and \u201cevery day an examination is carried out\u2026 to make sure that the handcuffs are not too tight\u201d.",
      "The UN has said reports of alleged torture and sexual violence by Israeli guards were \u201cgrossly illegal and revolting\u201d and enabled by \u201cabsolute impunity\u201d.",
      "\u2018A fertile ground for fostering brutality\u2019",
      "Michael Ofer-Ziv, 29, knew two people from his village who were killed on 7 October, among them Shani Louk whose body was paraded through Gaza on the back of a pickup truck in what became one of the most widely shared images of the war. \u201cThat was hell,\u201d he says.",
      "Michael was already a committed left-winger who advocated political not military solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, like his comrades, he felt reporting for reserve duty was correct. \u201cI knew that the military action was inevitable\u2026 and was justified in a way, but I was very worried about the shape it might take.\u201d",
      "His job was to work as an operations officer in a brigade war room, watching and directing action relayed back from drone cameras in Gaza. At times the physical reality of the war hit home.",
      "\u201cWe went to get some paper from somewhere in the main command of the Gaza area,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd at some point we opened the window\u2026 and the stench was like a butchery\u2026 Like in the market, where it's not very clean.\u201d",
      "Again it was a remark heard during a discussion among comrades that helped push him towards action. \u201cI think the most horrible sentence that I heard was someone who said to me that the kids that we spared in the last war in Gaza [2014] became the terrorists of October 7, which I bet is true for some cases\u2026 but definitely not all of them.\u201d",
      "Such extreme views existed among a minority of soldiers, he says, but the majority were \u201cjust indifferent towards the price\u2026 what's called \u2018collateral damage\u2019, or Palestinian lives\u201d. He\u2019s also dismayed by statements that Jewish settlements should be built in Gaza after the war - a stated aim of far-right government ministers, and even some members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party.",
      "Figures suggest there is a growing body of officers and troops within the IDF who come from what is called a \u2018National Religious\u2019 background: these are supporters of far-right Jewish nationalist parties who advocate settlement and annexation of Palestinian lands, and are firmly opposed to Palestinian statehood. According to research from the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, a non-governmental think tank, the number of such officers graduating from the military academy rose from 2.5% in 1990 to 40% in 2014.",
      "Ten years ago, one of Israel\u2019s leading authorities on the issue, Professor Mordechai Kremnitzer, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, warned about what he called the \u2018religification\u2019 of the army. \u201cWithin this context, messages about Jewish superiority and demonisation of the enemy are fertile ground for fostering brutality and releasing soldiers from moral constraints.\u201d",
      "The decisive moment for Michael Ofer-Ziv came when the IDF shot three Israeli hostages in Gaza in December 2023. The three men approached the army stripped to the waist, and one held a stick with a white cloth. The IDF said a soldier had felt threatened and opened fire, killing two hostages. A third was wounded but then shot again and killed, when a soldier ignored his commander\u2019s ceasefire order.",

And I also remember thinking, there is just no way this is the first time [innocent people were shot]\u2026 It's just the first time that we are hearing about it, because they are hostages. If the victims were Palestinians, we just would never hear about it.\u201d",
      "The IDF has said that refusal to serve by reservists is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and Prime Minister Netanyahu insists it is \u201cthe most moral army in the world\u201d. For most Israelis, the IDF is the guarantor of their security; it helped found Israel in 1948 and is an expression of the nation - every Israeli citizen over 18 who is Jewish (and also Druze and Circassian minorities) must serve.",
      "The refusers have attracted some hostility. Some prominent politicians, like Miri Regev, a cabinet member and former IDF spokeswoman, have called for action. \u201cRefusers should be arrested and prosecuted,\" she has said.",
      "But the government has so far avoided tough action because, according to Yuval Green, \u201cthe military realised that it only draws attention to our actions, so they try to let us go quietly.\u201d For those starting their national service and who refuse, sanctions are tougher. Eight conscientious objectors - not part of the reservists group - due to begin their military service at 18 years old have served time in military prison.",

      "\u201cI strongly oppose them [the refusers],\u201d says Major Sam Lipsky, 31, a reservist who fought in Gaza during the current war but is now based outside the Strip. He accuses the refusers group of being \u201chighly political\u201d and focused on opposing the current government.",
      "\u201cI don't have to be a Netanyahu fan in order to not appreciate people using the military, an institution we're all meant to rally behind, as political leverage.\u201d",
      "Maj Lipsky is a supporter of what he views as Israel\u2019s mainstream right - not the far right represented by government figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister who has been convicted of inciting racism and supporting terrorism, and finance minister, Belazel Smotrich, who recently called for the population of Gaza to be halved by encouraging \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d.",
      "Maj Lipsky acknowledges the civilian suffering in Gaza and does not deny the imagery of dead and maimed women and children.",
      "As we speak at his home in southern Israel, his two young children are sleeping in the next room. \u201cThere's no way to fight the war and to prosecute a military campaign without these images happening,\u201d he says. He then uses an expression heard in the past from Israeli leaders: \u201cYou can't mow the lawn without grass flying up. It is not possible.\u201d",
      "He says the blame belongs to Hamas who went to \u201crandomly slaughter as many Jews as possible, women, children, soldiers\u201d.",
      "The imperative of fighting the war has postponed a deepening struggle over the future character of the Jewish state. It is, in large part, a conflict between the secularist ideals held by people like Michael Ofer-Zif and Yuval Green, and the increasingly powerful religious right represented by the settlements movement, and their champions in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, including figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Add to that the lingering, widespread anger over the government\u2019s attempts to dilute the power of the country\u2019s judiciary in 2023 - it led to mass demonstrations in the months before October 7 - and the stage is set for a turbulent politics long after the war ends.",
      "On both sides it is not unusual to hear people talk of a struggle for the soul of Israel.",
      "Maj Lipsky was packing to return to military duty on the evening I met him, sure of his duty and responsibility. No peace until Hamas was defeated.",
      "Among the refusers I spoke with, there was a determination to stand by their principles. Michael Ofer-Ziv may leave Israel, unsure whether he can be happy in the country. \u201cIt just looks less and less likely that I will be able to hold the values that I hold, wanting the future that I want for my kids to live here, and that is very scary,\u201d he says.",
      "Yuval Green is training to become a doctor, and hopes that a settlement can be reached between peacemakers among the Israeli and Palestinian people. \u201cI think in this conflict, there are only two sides, not the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. There is the side that supports violence and the side that supports, you know, finding better solutions.\u201d There are many Israelis who would disagree with that analysis, but it won\u2019t stop his mission.",

      "The Lightroom in London uses digital projection and audio technology in a high-walled space to generate an immersive experience for visitors.",
      "It has previously hosted a blockbuster David Hockney show and Tom Hanks\u2019s exhibition on the history of space travel.",
      "Now the exhibition space gives audiences a front-row seat at some of the most spectacular fashion shows in history, tapping into Vogue\u2019s archive and contributor network.",
      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",
      "The Italian designer Gianni Versace, though, was \u201calways on time\u201d,",
      "\u201cIt didn\u2019t matter who wasn\u2019t there, it could have been the Pope, he didn\u2019t care\u201d.",
      "That would have suited Wintour, who is \u201chorribly punctual, usually early\u201d.",
      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ghanaians are about to elect a new president amid concerns about inflation, unemployment and debt.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana is heading for its ninth general election since multiparty politics resumed in 1992.",
      "In that time, there have been three peaceful transfers of power, with the two main parties \u2013 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) \u2013 holding the presidency for a total of 16 years each.",
      "Here, in charts, are the big issues this time round as the NPP goes for an unprecedented third successive term in power.",
      "Ghanaians were hit particularly hard in the pocket by the global bout of inflation, beginning in early 2022, that saw prices rise in the country at their fastest rate for more than two decades.",
      "The annual rate of increase reached a peak of 54.1% in December 2022. It has since come down, but this is just an average and prices of some staples have continued to go up sharply.",
      "Eggs and tomatoes, for instance were more than twice as expensive in February 2024 as they were 12 months earlier. Other Ghanaian favourites have also shot up with wages not keeping pace.",
      "Although the popular national dish - Ga kenkey (fermented maize dumplings) with fish - has not seen such a big jump, the balls of kenkey are now smaller.",
      "As a result, more people have been pushed into poverty and living standards have suffered, the World Bank says.",
      "In 2022, Ghana defaulted on its debt repayments and was forced into lengthy negotiations with international lenders to try and restructure the loans, which are still on-going.",
      "Local lenders were forced into taking lower repayments.",
      "The government also went to the International Monetary Fund to get help with a bailout programme.",
      "President Nana Akufo-Addo admitted the country was in \u201ccrisis\u201d but blamed outside forces. The opposition and some economists said it was down to economic mismanagement by the government.",
      "The amount of money that Ghana owes its creditors has steadily risen for the last two decades, but there was a sharp uptick in 2019, and by 2022 the government needed more than 70% of its income just to service the debt.",
      "The country\u2019s economic difficulties have been accompanied by a steadily rising unemployment rate.",
      "Going back two decades, one in 20 Ghanaians able to work were unemployed - that figure now stands at one in seven.",
      "With more than half the population - some 24 million people - under the age of 35, young people have been particularly hard-hit.",
      "For 15-to-24-year-olds the unemployment rate is twice the overall figure, with nearly 30% without a job.",
      "The views of younger voters could have a big impact on the outcome of the election.",
      "As Africa\u2019s largest \u2013 and the world\u2019s 10th biggest \u2013 producer of the precious metal, gold plays a big role in the economy.",
      "Gold mining has become a major talking-point in the months leading up to the election, with complaints about the damage that small-scale and illegal mining is doing to the environment.",
      "But with the global gold price more than doubling in the last decade, the attraction of getting involved in the business is obvious.",
      "Gold is a big foreign-exchange earner for Ghana \u2013 in 2023, exports amounted to $5.2bn (\u00a34.1bn).",
      "Along with gold, the country has resources of oil, gas, diamonds, bauxite and lithium among other things.",
      "It is also a big player in the global cocoa market, being the world's second largest supplier of the vital ingredient of chocolate.",
      "These resources have transformed the economy over the past three decades and enabled the country to become much richer, with extreme poverty dropping by half in that time, World Bank experts have said.",
      "The average annual income per person has gone through a dramatic shift since 2005, with the standard of living showing a marked increase up to 2017.",
      "Since then, however, it has barely risen, except for a spike in 2021.",
      "At election time, politicians have to contend with the fact that voters tend not to take the long-term view but generally base their choice on whether things are improving in the short term.",
      "The last three decades have seen a series of closely fought and peaceful elections.",
      "As a result Ghana has often been held up as an example of an open democracy that has turned its back on instability and its own history of coups in a region where they are still an issue.",
      "In some cases, elections hinged on just tens of thousands of votes and despite occasional legal challenges, the results have generally been accepted by the losers.",

      "Many interviewees requested anonymity for their own safety. Some details of individual accounts could not be verified due to the difficulty of reporting independently from Syria.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in complete apprehension,\u201d he said. He added that the air strikes that have hit the city over the past few days reminded him of earlier periods in the war.",
      "Aleppo, most of which had been captured by rebels in the early years of the Syrian civil war, was retaken by Syrian government forces backed by Russia in 2016 after a gruelling siege.",
      "Since then, the city has mostly avoided direct warfare. The Syrian government claims credit for what it says is the ongoing reconstruction of the city, which until the war was Syria\u2019s commercial hub.",
      "But NGOs and independent journalists accuse the government of widespread human rights abuses there, including torture and killings of civilians and non-existent democratic rights.",
      "Abdulkafi and his father's reunion was joyful - but Abdulkafi said some of his relatives were afraid to be seen with him for fear of retribution were regime forces to retake the city once again.",
      "\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four is applied in Aleppo. Assad\u2019s image is on every building, streets, on every corner. He is controlling their minds,\u201d he said, referring to the George Orwell novel about totalitarianism.",
      "HTS was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaeda. It has since split from the group and claims to have moderated its ideology. Human rights groups accuse HTS of arbitrarily detaining and mistreating critical journalists and civilians, claims the group denies.",
      "Some in Aleppo remain fearful. One woman said people were \u201cconfused and scared\u201d following the rebel takeover. She said she hadn't left her house at first, but later went for walks and drives with her family after hearing that civilians were not being harassed by the rebels.",
      "\u201cEverywhere was relatively calm. But everyone looked scared and anxious, you could sense it in their faces and their reactions. No-one looked comfortable.",

      "\u201cThey said they would respect them and allow them to do whatever they want, as Christians and as Armenians.\u201d",
      "Mr Meneshian said Christians were suspicious of HTS promises, saying minority groups in Syria had previously been persecuted by jihadist groups which at first said they would not harm non-Muslims. He said many had grown used to Assad\u2019s rule, which was authoritarian but at least did not actively persecute Armenians.",

      "\"Look, 99.9% of the bureau is made up of hard working agents who adhere to the principles of fidelity, bravery and integrity,\" Jeff Lanza, a former FBI agent, said. \"But he's said that he's coming in to just decimate the agency. How is that going to go well and how will that play into the morale of the agents who have to work under him?\"",
      "Trump selected Patel, an unconventional nominee and vocal critic of the FBI, because of his agenda to carry out a radical overhaul of the agency he's been tapped to lead.",
      "The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.",

      "Gregory Brower, a former FBI assistant director and deputy general counsel who worked closely with the past two directors, called the job \"nonstop\".",
      "\"It's relentless. It's high stakes. It requires expert judgment, stamina, experience, and a strong ethical and moral compass,\" he told the BBC.",

      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "When he announced his pick for FBI director, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\".",
      "Patel began his career as a federal public defender in Miami before working as a terrorism prosecutor at the Department of Justice between 2014 and 2017. He then spent two years as senior aide to Republicans who led the House Intelligence Committee, reportedly fighting the investigation of Trump and Russian collusion in the 2016 election.",
      "When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, he was hired as a staffer on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. In February 2020, he became principal deputy in the Office of Director of National Intelligence - then led by acting director Richard Grenell.",
      "By November of that year, he had moved to the Pentagon to serve as chief ofstaff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller - a position he held until Trump left office two months later.",
      "\u201cKash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director,\" Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, told the BBC.",
      "Those critical of Patel cite past FBI directors, many of whom worked their way up through the justice department or FBI for decades, as a better measure of the qualifications needed to lead the agency.",
      "\"It's certainly not like the backgrounds that we've seen other directors of the FBI and those who have overseen other similarly sized and important federal agencies bring to their jobs,\" Brower said of Patel's experience.",
      "Some pointed to former US Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s recollection in his 2022 memoir of Trump's attempt to place Patel in a senior FBI position in his first term to stress the point further.",
      "\u201cI categorically opposed making Patel deputy FBI director. I told Mark Meadows it would happen \u2018over my dead body,'\u201d he wrote. \u201cSomeone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.\u201d",
      "Since leaving office, Patel has promised in interviews that, if Trump returns to office, he and others will use the government to go after political opponents - including politicians and members of the media who he alleges without evidence helped overturn the 2020 US presidential election results.",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel told Steve Bannon, a White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, on the War Room podcast.",
      "\"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026 We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Trump said during his reelection campaign that he considers Patel\u2019s book - titled Government Gangsters - to be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for his next administration.",
      "In the memoir, which criticises the so-called deep state, Patel calls for \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the FBI by firing \u201cthe top ranks\u201d.",
      "On a recent podcast, he said the incoming Trump administration intends to retain about 50 members of the FBI\u2019s Washington staff, and the remaining workforce would be put into the field. They would, in essence, \"close that building down\", he said, referring to FBI headquarters.",
      "\u201cOpen it up the next day as the museum to the deep state,\u201d he added.",
      "The FBI did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Mr Grenell and other former Trump administration officials who worked with Patel have praised his nomination and characterised him as a hardworking public servant.",
      "\u201cI have no doubt that Kash Patel will inspire our line FBI agents who want to fight crime, destroy the cartels, capture spies, and jail mobsters, thugs, fraudsters and traffickers,\u201d Robert O\u2019Brien, Trump\u2019s last national security adviser, said on X.",
      "Few, however, mentioned current FBI Director Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump after the then-president fired the agency\u2019s last leader - James Comey - or that he still has three years remaining on his term.",
      "Ultimately, it remains up to the Senate who will vote on whether Patel's nomination will be confirmed.",
      "While most senators have remained relatively quiet about Patel and a few Republicans have praised the pick, there is some apparent scepticism.",
      "Senator Mike Rounds, a Republican from South Dakota, seemed to raise some doubt that he would receive the necessary votes.",
      "\u201cI think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\u201d Rounds told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see what his (Trump\u2019s) process is, and whether he actually makes that nomination,\u201d Rounds commented about Patel. \u201cWe still go through a process, and that process includes advice and consent, which, for the Senate, means advice or consent sometimes.\u201d",
      "Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin, a Democrat who will soon hand his gavel to Republicans, stressed that Trump knows Wray\u2019s term has not yet expired and called for his colleagues to block Patel's confirmation.",
      "\u201cThe President-elect wants to replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist,\u201d Durbin said in a statement. \u201cThe Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponise the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised.\u201d",

    "summary": "Villagers remain scarred a year after the military mistook them for jihadists, killing 85 people.",
    "story": [
      "An Islamic school teacher, Masud Abdulrasheed, is struggling to come to terms with the killing of his seven-year-old daughter in drone strikes by Nigeria's military during a religious festival in their large but sparsely populated village exactly a year ago.",
      "The military said the bombing was caused by \"a failure of intelligence\", leading the army to mistake the open-air festival in Tudunbiri for a gathering of jihadist fighters.",
      "\"The incident of December 3rd, 2023 was a great tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\" military spokesman Maj-Gen Edward Buba told the BBC. \"The armed forces regret that incident. And if we could bring the lives lost back, we would.\"",
      "Warning: This story contains graphic details which some readers may find distressing",
      "About 85 people were killed, including Mr Abdulrasheed's little daughter Habeebah, when unmanned drones dropped two bombs on the village in northern Kaduna state.",
      "\"The first bomb dropped on us at around 10 pm, close to a tree where women and children were seated,\" Mr Abdulrasheed recalled. \"We ran for safety, but moments later we gathered to help those injured and also called for help, but the second bomb was dropped and it killed more people.\"",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed described Habeebah as \"the most caring among my children\".",
      "\"She would always give me whatever gift she was given, even if I didn\u2019t need it,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The 36-year-old was one of the organisers of the annual festival, known as Maulud, held to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Many of his students were killed in the tragedy.",
      "\"We saw dead bodies all over the place as if they were sleeping. Body parts were strewn around the tree branches and rooftops. We had to pack them inside sacks and buried all the dead in a mass grave.",
      "\"There is nothing more devastating than seeing people you invited for a celebration coming to meet their end. I am so heartbroken,\" Mr Abdulrasheed said.",
      "As the father of four spoke to the BBC, he sat his second daughter, Zaharau, beside him on a mat outside their home. He gently pulled up her top to show a wound on her stomach.",
      "Four-year-old Zaharau was hit by shrapnel. It took at least an hour to drive her and the other wounded to the nearest hospital in Kaduna city.",
      "Although she underwent surgery, her wound still hasn't fully healed.",
      "\"When my daughter and the others that got injured were at the hospital, they were well taken care of. We thank the government for that.",
      "\"But things changed after they got discharged, months later. The hospital has refused to continue with their [free] treatment. They keep giving us excuses.\"",
      "Walking around Tudunbiri, there is hardly a family not affected by the tragedy of that fateful night.",
      "Twenty-year-old Aisha Buhari lost three of her younger brothers. She survived, suffering an injury to her left arm that is yet to heal.",
      "Sitting on a stool, she cried and wiped her tears with her hijab as she recalled the last moments of her brothers.",
      "\"That night, I just finished talking with them and stepped away for a moment when the first bomb hit, only for me to see their dead bodies on the ground moments later,\" Ms Buhari said.",
      "\"When they rushed me to the hospital, I could not think of anything but my brothers. I cried so much.\"",
      "As Ms Buhari spoke, she paused to wipe the pus oozing from her wound.",
      "\"There was no house or farm task I could not do before the incident, but now I can\u2019t do anything properly. I depend on people to help with something as basic as washing clothes,\" she said.",
      "Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that he would look into the plight of villagers like Ms Buhari.",
      "\"Thank you BBC for this information. I will personally go back to Tudunbiri, and if I find people that still need treatment, I will take care of it,\" he promised.",
      "\"The instruction I gave was that all the injured should be treated and none of them should be discharged until they are fully recovered,\" he added.",
      "Undeterred by last year\u2019s tragedy, the Muslim faithful in Tudunbiri celebrated the festival again this year, but held it two months earlier.",
      "The occasion also marked the inauguration of a mosque the authorities have built for them over the bomb site, as a form of compensation.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed acts as the mosque's imam as the previous one was killed in the air strikes.",
      "\"We are happy about the new mosque, but we can never forget what happened,\" Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC. \"Any time I come here, I always remember that day, and I feel depressed. As we celebrate this year\u2019s Maulud, we also mourn those that we lost.\"",
      "For years, Nigeria's military has been battling armed jihadists and criminals, who raid villages and kidnap people for ransom in parts of the north.",
      "This has led to an upsurge in air strikes aimed at targeting them.",
      "The Nigerian Air Force has obtained \"a multitude\" of new aircraft, the editor of Defence Web, Guy Martin, told the BBC.",
      "This included Chinese-built unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones.",
      "\"Chinese UAVs are cheaper, making them more accessible. Nearly a third of African countries have acquired UAVs, mainly from Turkey and China,\" Mr Martin said, pointing out that it was strikes from UAVs that caused the disaster in Tudunbiri.",
      "\"Intelligence failure, poor coordination, and inadequate operator training are some of the reasons for erroneous strikes. The rapid deployment of UAV technology often outpaces the development of proper training and engagement protocols for military personnel,\" Mr Martin added.",
      "Maj-Gen Buba told the BBC that the military had found itself operating in a \"challenging and complex\" operational environment.",
      "\"But we have grown in our equipment holding and in our deployments of more experienced commanders and troops,\" he said.",
      "According to consulting firm SBM Intelligence, the Nigerian Air Force carried out 17 accidental air strikes between January 2017 and September 2024, killing more than 500 people.",
      "\"One mistake is enough; when we see hundreds being killed in erroneous attacks, we should be concerned,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) Nigeria researcher Anietie Ewang said.",
      "In response, Maj-Gen Buba said that rights campaigners should \"give us more credit for being more transparent, for working with the people, and for being more accountable for our actions, as was revealed particularly during the Tudunbiri incident\".",
      "\"We will do everything possible to ensure that this never happens [again],\" Maj-Gen Buba added.",
      "He said that two army personnel were being court-martialled over the incident and while the case was still in progress, the military had redeployed them and relieved them of their command.",
      "Both the federal and state government have also unveiled development projects for the village as part of efforts to show remorse for the deaths, with Sani telling the BBC that the construction of a hospital and skills acquisition centre was almost complete.",
      "\"We have been supporting the people of Tudunbiri, and we will continue to do that,\" he said.",
      "\"They are my people,\" the governor added.",
      "But in a cruel irony, more than 20 people in the village reported that their farmland had been confiscated for the projects.",
      "They include 50-year-old Hashim Abdullahi, who told the BBC: \"I am not happy because this hospital has taken my means of livelihood and I was not compensated. I have been rendered jobless and can\u2019t provide for my family.\"",
      "In response, Sani said: \"For the people that genuinely have land, the department of land in Kaduna is working with the head of the community to ensure that the right people are given their land back.\"",
      "Nigeria's Vice-President Kashim Shettima also visited the village following the killings, promising - in conjunction with the state government - justice and financial compensation.",
      "People were told they would receive 2.5 million naira ($1,500; \u00a31,180) for each person killed in their family, while those injured were offered about 750,000 naira ($500).",
      "\"It is a difference that authorities actually carried out compensation this time around, but there is a sense that it has been very arbitrary,\" Ms Ewang said.",
      "\"We need to see the authorities take much-needed action towards justice, accountability, and compensation for victims in all of the other incidents of air strikes where they have accepted it was an error,\" she added.",
      "Ms Buhari told the BBC that her family had received the 7.5 million naira for her three brothers who were killed, and she got 750,000 naira for her injuries - though this was not enough.",
      "\"I usually buy drugs at a pharmacy to dress the wound because that\u2019s all I can afford to do now. The hospital doesn\u2019t attend to us any more. Sometimes the pain would be very severe for weeks,\" she said.",
      "\"We hope the government will come to our aid again so that I can get proper care for my arm. I can\u2019t wait to use it again,\" Ms Buhari added.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC he had not received financial compensation for the injuries suffered by his four-year-old.",
      "\"I always feel worried when I look at her condition,\" he said.",
      "He said he had received the full financial compensation for the death of his seven-year-old, but no amount of money could replace her.",
      "\"Every time I visit the grave site, I remember those we used to live together with but now they are no more. I miss them all. I miss my daughter.\"",

      "Shepherd J\u00f3zsef R\u00e1cz and his sons keep 500 ewes up on the high pasture here. It\u2019s a hard life: when he\u2019s not worrying about milking his sheep, which he does three times a day, he\u2019s worrying about protecting them from predators.",
      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",
      "The organisation also accused the Commission of prioritising political decisions over science, saying the decision was influenced by \"personal reasons after Commission President Von der Leyen\u2019s pony was killed by a wolf in 2022\".",
      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",

      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",

      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",

      "Short of another surprise,  France will once more be without a government on Wednesday.",
      "That is when Michel Barnier, appointed by President Macron after July\u2019s inconclusive parliamentary election,  faces a no-confidence motion over the budget - a vote he will almost certainly lose.",
      "As the left-wing MP Alexis Corbi\u00e8re put it in the National Assembly this afternoon: \u201cThat\u2019s it for Barnier. He\u2019s out of here.\u201d",
      "The arithmetic is merciless for the former Brexit negotiator, who now stands to end his career as the shortest-lived prime minister in France\u2019s Fifth Republic.",
      "From the start he has been leading an anomaly:  a minority government whose very survival depended on the indulgence of its enemies.",
      "In the National Assembly, Barnier could count on his own conservative group and the Macronites. But this centrist bloc has been easily outnumbered by a left-wing coalition on one side, and on the other the populist right of Marine Le Pen.",
      "And when those two forces combine - as they will in Wednesday\u2019s censure motion - then the numbers are too much, and Barnier must fall.",
      "It is a crisis that has been waiting to happen, but was deferred till now by long procedural haggling over the 2025 budget.",
      "Shortly after taking office in September, he proposed a budget that promised \u20ac60bn (\u00a349bn) in deficit reduction - necessary, he said, to satisfy Brussels and get the country\u2019s finances back in shape.",
      "But because he lacked a majority, his budget was then disfigured by opposition amendments - from both left and populist right - which removed taxes and introduced more spending, thus changing its essential nature.",
      "After much parliamentary to-ing and fro-ing with the conservative dominated Senate, Barnier came back with a new text, or technically texts, because there is a social security budget as well as the overall budget.",
      "But that version remains unacceptable to the opposition.",
      "Marine Le Pen, who could save Barnier if she chose to, made a series of new demands, including removing a new tax on electricity, and restoring fully index-linked pensions).",
      "Barnier gave ground - quite a lot in fact.  But it wasn\u2019t enough.  And now Le Pen plans to pull the plug.",
      "Barnier and his supporters have made much of their one good argument - the chaos scenario.",
      "What responsible party leader, they said, could want to tip France into the uncertainty and instability of yet another government crisis?",
      "Would Marine Le Pen really want to take the blame for the inevitable turbulence on the financial markets, the hike in borrowing costs, the spending cuts that would follow?",
      "Her response has been to say that warnings of doom are exaggerated: there will be no catastrophe. Technically France might not have a budget (which it won\u2019t if Barnier is ousted on Wednesday) but systems will kick in. The constitution allows for matters to be administered for a time by decree.",
      "Up to a point she is right.",
      "If Barnier falls, he will probably stay in power in a caretaker capacity while Macron (who is inconveniently in Saudi Arabia this week) seeks a replacement.",

      "In the meantime a special law could be passed carrying the 2024 budget into 2025, so that civil servants are paid and hospitals meet their heating bills. An eventual new government would then pass a retrospective \u201ccorrective\u201d budget to set the books straight.",

      "The north-west is dominated by the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), but Turkish-backed rebel factions - known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) - also control territory there with the support of Turkish troops.",
      "What is Hayat Tahrir al-Sham?",
      "HTS was set up in 2012 under a different name, al-Nusra Front, and pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda the following year.",
      "Al-Nusra Front was regarded as one of the most effective and deadly of the groups ranged against President Assad. But its jihadist ideology appeared to be its driving force rather than revolutionary zeal - and it was seen at the time as at odds with the main rebel coalition known as the Free Syrian Army.",
      "In 2016, Al-Nusra broke ties with al-Qaeda and took the name Hayat Tahrir al-Sham when it merged with other factions a year later. However, the UN, US, UK and a number of other countries continue to consider HTS as an al-Qaeda affiliate and frequently refer to it as al-Nusra Front.",
      "HTS consolidated its power in Idlib and Aleppo provinces by crushing its rivals, including al-Qaeda and Islamic State (IS) group cells, and set up the so-called Syrian Salvation Government to administer the territory.",
      "The eventual goal of HTS is to topple Assad and establish some form of Islamic governance. But it had shown little sign of attempting to reignite the conflict on a major scale and renew its challenge to Assad\u2019s rule - until now.",
      "Inside Aleppo: Family reunions, nervousness at rebel rule and fear of war",
      "Bowen: Syria's rebel offensive is astonishing - but don't write off Assad",
      "Why did the rebels launch an offensive?",
      "For several years, Idlib remained a battleground as Syrian government forces tried to regain control.",
      "But in 2020, Turkey and Russia brokered a ceasefire to halt a push by the government to retake Idlib. The ceasefire largely held despite sporadic fighting.",
      "In October, the UN special envoy for Syria said HTS had carried out a significant raid into government-held areas, Russia had resumed air strikes for the first time in months, and pro-government forces had significantly accelerated drone strikes and shelling.",
      "On Wednesday, HTS and allied groups said they had launched an offensive to \u201cdeter aggression\u201d, accusing the government and allied Iran-backed militias of escalation in the north-west.",
      "But it came at a time when the Syrian government and its allies were preoccupied with other conflicts.",
      "The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping Assad push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon, while Israeli strikes have eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia is also distracted by the war in Ukraine.",
      "Without them, Assad\u2019s forces have been left exposed.",
      "How have the government and its allies responded?",
      "President Assad has vowed to \u201ccrush\u201d the rebels, referring to them as \u201cterrorists\u201d.",
      "In a call with his Iranian counterpart Massoud Pezeshkian on Monday, he blamed the US and other Western countries for the offensive, saying them were trying to \u201credraw the map\u201d of the region.",
      "Pezeshkian emphasised that Iran stood \u201cfirmly alongside the Syrian government and people\u201d, and that preserving Syria\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity was a cornerstone of its regional strategy.",
      "Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia also considered the situation around Aleppo as \u201can attack on Syrian sovereignty\u201d, and that it was \u201din favour of the Syrian authorities bringing order to the area and restoring constitutional order as soon as possible\u201d.",
      "What are Western powers and Turkey saying?",
      "The US, UK, France and Germany - which are opposed to Assad - issued a joint statement on Monday that urged \u201cde-escalation by all parties and the protection of civilians and infrastructure to prevent further displacement and disruption of humanitarian access\u201d.",
      "They also called for a \u201cSyrian-led political solution to the conflict\u201d as outlined in a 2015 UN Security Council resolution.",
      "On Saturday, White House National Security Council spokesman Sean Savett said Assad\u2019s refusal to engage in a political process and his \u201creliance on Russia and Iran\u201d had \"created the conditions now unfolding\u201d.",
      "He also insisted that the \u201cUnited States has nothing to do with this offensive\u201d.",
      "Turkey\u2019s Foreign Minister, Hakan Fidan, also said \u201cit would be a mistake at this time to try to explain the events in Syria by any foreign interference\u201d and called on the Syrian government to \u201creconcile with its own people and the legitimate opposition\u201d."

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:57:15 GMT",
    "summary": "An act of clemency by Hunter Biden's father continues a tradition by American presidents.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued a presidential pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.",
      "The move has proven controversial, since the outgoing president previously ruled out such a move. But he claimed the cases against his son were politically motivated.",
      "His use of his pardoning powers continues a tradition of presidents on both sides of the American political divide granting clemency to people close to them.",
      "What did Hunter Biden do?",
      "Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing later this month in two federal cases.",
      "In June, he became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted - in a case relating to his gun ownership. He was found guilty by a jury in Delaware of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "He was also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in September in a federal tax case that centred on whether he paid enough tax from 2016-19. The nine charges included failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "He faced up to 25 years in prison in the gun case and 17 years in the tax case, though he was likely to get much shorter tariffs and to serve the two sentences concurrently, experts told the New York Times.",
      "Follow live reaction to this storyPresident Biden's statement in fullWhat has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differentlyFull story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "Follow live reaction to this story",
      "President Biden's statement in full",
      "What has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?",
      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".",
      "In this case, the president's \"full and unconditional pardon\" is unusually sweeping.",
      "It covers any potential federal crimes the younger Biden may have committed during a period of more than 10 years from January 2014 to December 2024.",
      "That spans a period beyond Hunter Biden's tax and gun offences and dates back to the year he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father, then US vice-president, had a key role in US policy towards Kyiv.",
      "The wording of the pardon also makes clear that it covers any offence that the younger Biden \"has committed or may have committed\".",
      "The pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office.",
      "Although the pardoning power is considered broad, it is not limitless. For example, a president can only issue pardons for federal (national-level) crimes.",
      "The issue is relevant because there is a question mark over the sentencing of Trump in his hush-money case in New York. He will be unable to pardon himself in that state-level case when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "How many pardons have other presidents issued?",
      "There is a long-standing precedent of US presidents on both sides of the political divide issuing pardons - including to people close to them. This is the 26th pardon issued by Biden, a Democrat.",
      "In 2020, Trump, a Republican, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering.",
      "And in 2001, Bill Clinton, pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a cocaine-related offence that dated back to 1985.",
      "In both cases, the pardons were given to people who had already served a sentence. President Biden's intervention in his son's case comes before sentencing.",
      "Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, according to the Pew Research Center, comprising 143 pardons and 94 commuted sentences. Many were in a flurry before he left office.",
      "That number is significantly fewer than his predecessor Barack Obama, who during his eight-year stint granted 1,927 acts of clemency, according to Pew. These were 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons.",
      "Most of those who received executive clemency under Obama had been convicted of narcotics charges at the height of the so-called US war on drugs.",
      "One of the most controversial presidential pardons was granted by Gerald Ford to his predecessor Richard Nixon in 1974 - covering acts that occurred during the Watergate Scandal. It was described as an effort to heal the nation.",
      "What have Biden and Trump said about pardons?",
      "The day after he took office in 2021, Biden emphasised that he would do things differently to Trump. His press secretary told reporters that the flurry of last-minute pardons issued by Trump was \"not a model... for how President Biden would use his own power. He would use his own power far more judiciously\".",
      "Biden said after his son's conviction that he would not issue a pardon. In the statement announcing his U-turn, he acknowledged that he had pledged to \"not interfere with the justice department\u2019s decision-making\". But, he said, the younger Biden had been \"singled out\" and subjected to a \"miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Trump is among those who have attacked Biden for the move, calling it an \"abuse\".",
      "The incoming president asked whether Biden would also pardon supporters of his who were prosecuted over the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.",
      "Trump, who faced a series of legal issues while away from the White House, has repeatedly made the allegation that the US justice system has been weaponised against him and his supporters.",
      "He has promised to issue pardons of his own for those who rioted in Washington. But who exactly will be granted clemency, and whether pardons will extend to those convicted of the most serious and violent offences, is still an open question."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 21:16:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

      "The band posted about the incident on their Instagram account. Cellphone video showed an individual taking items out of a van as the person taking the video shouts for one of the band's party to get down before yelling, \"Ring the police! Ring the police!\"",

      "In the video, one of the individuals robbing the van can be seen brandishing a firearm, reportedly at the tour manager. Two members of the band's touring contingent are then seen running back into the Starbucks as people in the coffee shop can be heard instructing people to stay inside.

      "The band had been scheduled to start their U.S. tour in San Francisco at the Kilowatt on Monday night, but a cancelled flight out of the United Kingdom led to that show being rescheduled at the Chapel for this Saturday evening. The delay meant that Sport Team would actually kick off their tour with an all-ages show Tuesday night at the Goldfield Trading Post in Sacramento. The band was on their way to Sacramento when the robbery happened.",
      "\"Police response was \"submit an online report.\" Lost a lot of personal gear, but they didn't get the instruments so driving on to Sacramento to play tonight,\" the band said in their Instagram post. They later confirmed they lost gaming consoles, their passports and personal computers.",
      "CBS News Bay Area reached out to the Vallejo Police Department regarding the incident, but has not yet heard back.",
      "While the post attempted some levity, the band seemed shocked and shaken at what happened to them.",
      "\"In all seriousness pretty shocking how resigned everyone seemed to be to it. 'It happens,'\" the post said in closing. \"9am at some petrol station Starbucks. Wild.\"",
      "CBS News Sacramento spoke with the band prior to their performance at the Goldfield Trading Post Tuesday. They said they were disappointed about what happened and how they say police responded, but surprisingly remain optimistic about their upcoming tour.",

    "summary": "At 32, she's an accomplished actor, successful singer-songwriter, billionaire business owner, and philanthropist. But Selena Gomez's gutsiest move may have been sharing her real self.",
    "story": [
      "On any red carpet, Selena Gomez is the picture of beauty, poise and confidence. But she'll be the first to tell you that things aren't always what they appear. For instance, her latest film: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez.\" Gomez co-stars as the wife of a powerful Mexican drug lord who secretly transitions. The film is a hard-hitting true crime story, a poignant love story, a journey of self-discovery \u2013 and a musical. But somehow it all works.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Emilia P\u00e9rez\" click on the video player below:",
      "Gomez said shooting left her \"a little sore\" from all the dance numbers. So, why did she want to do it? \"I found it incredibly compelling,\" she said. \"I've never really seen a movie like this before. I don't think I've ever been this proud of something in the acting field.\"",
      "And that's really saying something; at 32, Gomez has a lot to be proud of: She's an accomplished actor, but she's also a very successful singer-songwriter, and thanks to her wildly popular Rare Beauty line of cosmetics, she's a billionaire, and a very active philanthropist. It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",
      "Gomez was born in the Texas town of Grand Prairie. Her mom, Mandy Teefy, was only 16 years old. Selena's parents split when she was five. She says the family had a lot of love, and not much else, with tough times when her mother struggled to put food on the table. \"My mom worked multiple jobs,\" she said. \"She also was finishing high school when she was having me. When I'm doing something great today, it just makes me more thankful for the lessons that my mother taught me.\"",
      "Gomez was barely 10 when she landed a part on TV's \"Barney & Friends,\" and a few years later she became a fixture on the Disney Channel, on such shows as \"Wizards of Waverly Place.\"",
      "She branched out into music, and became a pop sensation. And when the pandemic came, she switched gears again, hosting \"Selena + Chef,\" a popular online cooking show shot in the kitchen of her L.A. home. \"We had cameras everywhere, from every aspect of it,\" she said.",
      "And how are her cooking skills now? \"They're not that great, I'm not gonna lie!\" she laughed.",
      "And then, in 2021 she helped cook up one of the biggest hits on TV: \"Only Murders in the Building.\" She praised her co-stars, Steve Martin and Martin Short: \"These men, Steve and Martin, have been working longer than I've been alive, but they are the first ones to be on set. They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways. These guys have become my friends and allies and people I can ask advice from. I couldn't be more grateful to work with them.\"",
      "Gomez is the first to admit that she's had a magical life, and that it hasn't always been a bed of roses. She's been open about her health struggles, like having lupus and receiving a kidney transplant.",
      "She also decided to take her struggles with anxiety and depression, and her bipolar diagnosis, public. Her 2022 documentary, \"Selena Gomez: My Mind & Me,\" is an unvarnished look at her life \u2013 the highs and the very deep lows.",
      "She admits she was a little nervous about sharing it with the world but, \"once I released it, it felt like a huge relief, because I am a firm believer that one of the strongest things you can do is be vulnerable. And that doesn't mean you have to pour your heart out to everyone. But I made that choice, because I knew I wasn't the only one that felt that way.

      "If the annual Jingle Ball at New York's Madison Square Garden is the Super Bowl of holiday concerts, then Elvis Duran is in the role of head coach. From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:24:56 -0500",
    "summary": "It was in the chaos of a kitchen where the chef, restaurateur and TV cooking judge (and author of the new cookbook-memoir, \"Why I Cook\") learned how to be himself.",
    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019.

      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours.

    "story": [
      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn.

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

      "\"These new controls only underscore the importance of strengthening our efforts with other countries to de-risk and diversify critical supply chains away from PRC (China),\" a White House spokesperson was quoted as saying by the Reuters news agency.",
      "\"In principle, the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials to the United States shall not be permitted,\" the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in its directive.",
      "According to consultancy Project Blue, China accounted for 98.8% of refined gallium production and 59.2% of refined germanium output this year. Last year, it accounted for 48% of globally mined antimony, which is used in items including nuclear weapons, ammunition and batteries.",
      "\"The move is a considerable escalation of tensions in supply chains where access to raw material units is already tight in the West,\" Project Blue cofounder Jack Bedder told Reuters.",
      "China issued the new ban just two days after the U.S. curbed exports to 140 companies in China's semiconductor industry. The U.S. crackdown \u2014 the third in three years \u2014 was aimed at stymieing China's ability to advance artificial intelligence technologies for military applications.",

      "\"It comes as no surprise that China has responded to the increasing restrictions by American authorities, current and imminent, with its own restrictions on the supply of these strategic minerals,\" Peter Arkell, chairman of the Global Mining Association of China, told Reuters. \"It's a trade war that has no winners.\"",

      "\"Enron will focus on scalable, sustainable solutions, including investments in renewable energy infrastructure, cutting-edge energy storage and advanced power distribution systems,\" the statement says.",
      "So what happened to the real Enron?",
      "Enron filed for bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001, amid revelations of hidden debt, inflated profits and accounting fraud. The collapse of the energy giant cost thousands of workers their jobs, while millions of investors saw their shares become worthless.",
      "Dozens of executives were charged, including former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who was sentenced to a 24-year prison term and fined $45 million in 2006 after being found guilty of 18 counts of fraud and conspiracy and one count of insider trading. Skilling was released from prison in 2018.",
      "Enron founder and Chairman Kenneth Lay was also convicted, but he died of a heart attack weeks later, while former Enron Chief Financial Officer Andy Fastow was released after about five years in prison.",
      "Who owns the Enron name now?",
      "The Enron trademark was bought in 2020 for $275 by The College Company, according to a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office document. The file says the company sells t-shirts and Polo shirts, and includes an image of t-shirt with the Enron logo along with the phrase \"Summer Internship 1997.\"",
      "The College Company is run by Connor Gaydos, whose LinkedIn account now identifies him as the CEO of Enron. Gaydos is also known for creating the \"birds aren't real\" satirical conspiracy theory with Peter McIndoe, which pokes fun at odd theories that now proliferate around the internet. The \"birds aren't real\" conspiracy theory posits that the U.S. government replaced real birds with drones.",
      "The X account for Enron tweeted on Monday, \"We're back. Can we talk?\"",
      "At the end of its tweet thread, it added, \"This is the final tweet in this thread. Any impersonators of Enron below this are a scam. Don't click on any links. Stay safe.\"",
      "The humor, such as it it is, seems lost on some former Enron employees.",
      "\"It's a pretty sick joke and it disparages the people that did work there. And why would you want to even bring it back up again?\" said former Enron employee Diana Peters, who represented workers in the company's bankruptcy proceedings.",
      "\"If it's a joke, it's rude, extremely rude. And I hope that they realize it and apologize to all of the Enron employees,\" she added.",

      "Federal law currently allows the agency to issue certificates that let employers pay certain workers less than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour based on the notion that their disabilities hinder productivity. Intended to help those with disabilities gain employment, the law currently has about 40,000 American workers laboring for half the minimum wage or less, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"Many earn less than half, some earn just pennies on the dollar,\" Taryn Williams, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment, said at a Tuesday news briefing.",
      "The agency has issued a proposed rule that would immediately stop the issuance of certificates that let employers pay less than the federal minimum and start a three-year phase-out period for the hundreds of employers that currently hold the permits.",
      "The Labor Department's proposal follows a review of the program, and the new rule would not take effect until a public comment period ends on Jan. 17, 2025, days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The new administration could review and respond to the comments and issue a final rule, or withdraw it entirely.",
      "Still, even if the proposal is not enacted, subminimum pay for those with disabilities could become a thing of the past, as more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already banned the program. The Illinois legislature recently\u00a0passed legislation to end subminimum wage for disabled workers by 2029. California Nevada and Virginia are also phasing out the program.",
      "Initiated under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the program was initially meant to provide jobs for injured military veterans. As things currently stand, many disabled people work in what are called sheltered workshops run by certified employers that pay as little as 25 cents an hour.",
      "As of November 1, more than 37,000 workers in 37 states were paid subminimum wages by 710 certificate holders, according to government\u00a0data. Another 35 employers had their certificate renewals pending.",

      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",
      "Federal law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0minors from working in meat processing due to an increased risk of injury.",

      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses.

      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours. Separately, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell reached a settlement with a New Jersey-based owner of Popeyes franchises across Massachusetts to resolve similar allegations, her office stated last week.",

      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data revealed Amazon contractors primarily in the company's \"middle-mile\" delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon. The analysis examined six years of monthly Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) unsafe driving rates and found the average rates of carriers who shipped for Amazon were at least 89% higher in every month.",
      "\"I was stunned,\" said Jason Miller, a professor at Michigan State University who is an expert in supply chain management. \"I've published many articles using these data. You do not see effects like this normally, where you have a set of carriers that is almost twice as unsafe as a different set of carriers.\"",
      "CBS News used roadside inspection reports in federal data to identify Amazon contractors. The reports, which are produced by law enforcement, indicate who a carrier said they were shipping for at the time of inspection. The analysis included carriers who shipped at least once for Amazon in the two years leading up to each month examined.",
      "Miller said the large patchwork of contractors Amazon uses for \"middle-mile\" transport poses challenges to ensuring a uniform culture of safety.",
      "\"The more you are essentially having your freight hauled by hundreds, if not thousands of small young firms, that makes it much more difficult to ensure those firms are operating safely versus a more - what we call strategic procurement model, where you may have a few very large carriers that you work with that handle a lot of freight,\" said Miller.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to FMCSA data, though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents. The FMCSA produces a crash involvement score for carriers, but it is not public.",
      "Amazon's response",
      "\"Any fatality is heartbreaking,\" said Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety. \"Any families that have been affected by this all have our condolences and our hearts go out to them.\"",
      "While Amazon mandates background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, Goodman said the company looks to the FMCSA to oversee \"middle-mile\" contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",
      "A spokeswoman for FMCSA confirmed it requires contractors who dispatch commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds to conduct background checks into drivers' safety performance history as a condition of employment.",
      "Amazon said when the company learns a contracted carrier has violated FMCSA guidelines, the carrier can face consequences, including permanent suspension.",
      "\"We have taken disciplinary action against around 19,000 motor carriers for failing to meet FMCSA safety requirements,\" Goodman said.",
      "Among those carriers is Take Flight with B, the contractor that hired Jordan Sannicola. Amazon confirmed it suspended Take Flight with B permanently from its contracted fleet.\u00a0 The motor carrier has since gone out of business.",
      "Goodman defended Amazon's continuing reliance on third-party trucking contractors to move its freight and deliver packages.",
      "\"In the United States, transportation with motor carriers is driven by independent businesses, small businesses,\" said Goodman. \"It has been that way since at least the Carter administration.\"",
      "\"We are unique at Amazon in terms of our scale,\" Goodman said. \"But it's a business model that has worked, and worked well, and we're committed to having it be a catalyst to be able to improve safety for the roads for all of us.\"",
      "Amazon disputes CBS News' data findings. In a statement sent after the interview, a spokesperson said: \"We've worked closely with CBS throughout this story, and are disappointed that they continue to use data based on a flawed methodology. We take safety incredibly seriously and the truth is that overall crash rates across third party carriers that we work with have improved. Our standards are stricter than FMCSA requirements, and we'll continue working to ensure our partners are the safest carriers on the road.\"",
      "Among other complaints, the company took issue with how CBS News identified Amazon contractors\u2014it said inspection reports sometimes list the wrong shipper\u2014and how CBS News measured a carrier's safety.",
      "Amazon measures safety using the FMCSA's \"unsafe driving score,\" which is a number that applies different standards depending on the size of the carrier. This score is not made public by the government, but the underlying data is. Rather than ranking the carriers by size, CBS News looked directly at the underlying rates of unsafe driving violations like texting and speeding.",
      "CBS News consulted with multiple leading supply chain researchers, who all use FMCSA measures in peer-reviewed studies. Alex Scott, a University of Tennessee professor and expert in supply chain management, said he does not use the FMCSA's scores in part because they make smaller carriers appear safer than they are.",
      "\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Scott said. \"If they're less safe, then they're less safe.\"",
      "What the court system says",
      "On Oct. 11, a judge sentenced Jordan Sannicola to a 40-year prison term for the charge of \"failing to stop and render aid -- accident involving death\" in the crash that killed Iliana Velez.",
      "\"One mistake cost someone's life, and that was my daughter's, and her life was just getting started,\" Trula Valez said.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk was seeking to reinstate a massive 2018 Tesla pay package after shareholders had reapproved it, but a judge denied his request.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's efforts to get his massive $56 billion 2018 Tesla pay package reinstated was rejected by a Delaware judge on Monday.",
      "The decision, issued by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, comes after a majority of Tesla shareholders in August reauthorized the compensation package during the electric vehicle maker's annual meeting.",
      "After it was initially approved in 2018, the pay package sparked a lawsuit from some Tesla shareholders who accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. In January 2024, McCormick had ruled that Musk and his company failed to prove that the huge payout was legally warranted, prompting Musk to take the issue back to his shareholders in August.",
      "In her Dec. 2 decision, McCormick said that Musk had asked the court \"to flip its decision and enter judgment in their favor.\"",
      "She added, \"The motion to revise is denied,\" citing what the judge described as \"at least four fatal flaws\" in arguments from Musk's attorneys.",
      "\"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\" McCormick noted.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Tesla fell slightly in after-hours trading, dipping $4.74, or 1.3%, to $352.35. The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign.",
      "The stock options Tesla granted to Musk were initially worth $2.6 billion but had soared to $56 billion when McCormick blocked the package in January, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News.",
      "\"No basis in the common law\"",
      "Musk's attorneys had argued that the second vote made clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick had earlier pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\"",
      "She also objected to Musk's attempt to recertify the pay package through another shareholder vote, which she wrote his attorneys had argued served as \"common law ratification.\"",
      "\"What the defendants call 'common law ratification' has no basis in the common law \u2014 a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,\" she noted. \"[E]ven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement.\"",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argue they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "Despite the setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $343 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 10:10:33 -0500",
    "summary": "A CBS News investigation tracked plastic cups from Starbucks recycling bins to landfills and incinerators across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Many consumers trust that when they toss a plastic cup into a recycling bin at a restaurant or coffee shop, it will be recycled and turned into something new. However, a CBS News investigation uncovered that this isn't always true.",
      "CBS News investigated what happens at one of the largest users of plastic cups that advertises its recycling practices: Starbucks. Reporters placed plastic cold drink cups, embedded with trackers, into 57 labeled recycling bins at Starbucks locations across the country to see where the cups went. Only 36 provided reliable data.",
      "The trackers were superglued between two Starbucks cold drink plastic cups and CBS News monitored each tracker's location multiple times a day until the trackers stopped moving.",
      "Of the 36 cups CBS News dropped, 32 did not go to a recycling facility. Fourteen cups were traced to landfills, five to incinerators, and thirteen to waste transfer stations, where trash is compacted before being sent to landfills or incinerators. Only four cups were traced to Material Recovery Facilities, where recyclables are sorted and prepared for reuse.",
      "While attaching a metal Bluetooth tracker to plastic and placing it in a recycling bin could contaminate the item and prevent it from being recycled, only four of the cups tagged by CBS News went to facilities that sort and remove this type of contamination, whereas the rest were immediately diverted for the landfill or incineration.",
      "Two of the trackers revealed a surprising journey: one dropped at a Starbucks in New Jersey and another in Boston both traveled thousands of miles before ultimately ending up in the same landfill in Alabama.",
      "\"When it comes to recycling, companies across the country and the world are lying about all these single-use plastics, saying they're recyclable,\" said Jan Dell, a former chemical engineer and founder of The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit dedicated to combating plastic pollution. \"They're not telling the truth.\"",
      "The challenge of plastic waste",
      "Americans produce more plastic waste each year than any other country \u2013 almost 500 pounds per person. Most of that plastic ends up as trash, according to a 2022 Greenpeace USA report, which revealed that the U.S. recycling rate for plastics is less than 6%.",
      "Companies such as Starbucks, which sells beverages to more than 6 billion customers a year globally, are a major generator of plastic waste. More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups, but the company aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030.",
      "\"Our goal for cups is that 100% of our customer-facing cups will be reusable, recyclable or compostable,\" says Amelia Landers, vice president of innovation and solutions at Starbucks. Landers was part of the team that redesigned its cold plastic cups in April to be made with up to 20% less plastic, which she says will help divert more than 13 million pounds of plastic from landfills each year.",
      "\"There's a guilt factor associated with using the single-use plastic, for maybe 20 minutes, and then having it exist in the landfill forever, or get incinerated and cause carbon emissions,\" said Dell, which is one of the reasons she believes Starbucks encourages recycling in-store.",
      "But making sure that Starbucks cup is recycled is harder than you might think. Unlike other recyclable materials such as glass, paper or aluminum, plastics are not uniform. Thousands of different types exist, each with unique characteristics, chemicals and additives, making sorting and recycling nearly impossible. For instance, certain beverage bottles cannot be recycled with food containers because they are made from different types of plastic, are different shapes and may be different colors.",
      "Can Starbucks cups be recycled?",
      "Consumers assume items like Starbucks cups can be recycled because of the arrows on the cup or blue bins in the store, but only 9% of Material Recovery Facilities sort the specific plastic that makes a Starbucks cup to be sold as recycled content and very few places actually buy that plastic to recycle it into new content.",
      "Starbucks cups are made out of polypropylene, or No. 5 plastic, and Landers told CBS News that these cups are designed to be recyclable and there are facilities that do this in the U.S. CBS News asked Starbucks to send a list of companies that recycle No. 5 plastic beverage cups. They sent a list of four facilities: three that collected and sorted No. 5 plastics, but only one company, KW Plastics in Alabama, recycles No. 5 cups into new plastic items.",

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 13:16:44 -0500",
    "summary": "Some companies are weaving Trump's tariffs into their marketing efforts, telling consumers to buy now in case prices rise.",
    "story": [
      "Some retailers are using President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs to urge consumers to shop now, suggesting if the import duties go into effect next year, a\u00a0range of goods could cost Americans a lot more money.",
      "It's yet another sales tactic some companies are implementing, in addition to the traditional Black Friday discounts, to get consumers to spend as much as possible ahead of the holidays.",
      "On Monday, Trump pledged to add a 25% tariff on all products\u00a0from Mexico and Canada, along with a 10% levy on Chinese goods, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S. The proposed taxes are in addition to earlier campaign promises to impose a baseline 10% tariff on all U.S. imports and a 60% tariff on goods shipped from China, once he takes office.",
      "While\u00a0prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise if Trump moves forward with his tariff proposals, some retail experts say that retailers may be seeking to tap into people's universal fear of missing out on a limited-time offer or experience. But the tactic could also rub some shoppers the wrong way, experts caution.",
      "\"It's a double-edged sword. I think it it might get people interested in buying things, but it could also split consumers if they think everyone's going to bring their prices up,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData. \"The other problem is it's slightly political as well, so some retailers would want to steer clear of it.\"",
      "While Trump has said he plans to move forward with tariffs, some economists have pointed out that the next administration may simply use the duties as a bargaining chip, which could enable the White House to strike new trade deals, for instance. Even though the tariffs are far from certain, a number of companies have explicitly said the levies floated by Trump would inevitably force them to raise prices for consumers.",
      "\"Lock in our current prices\"",
      "For example, filtered shower head maker Jolie recently said it would have pass along some of the anticipated costs from the tariffs to consumers. In a recent email to customers, the company said that tariffs on goods made outside of the U.S. would \"mean we would need to raise our prices.\"",
      "\"If you're considering buying a Jolie, now is a great time to lock in our current prices,\" the company added. Currently, a shower head with a filter subscription costs $148. The company announced a \"potential\" new price of $178.",
      "Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy CEO Corie Barry similarly said on its latest earnings call that the goods it sells could become more expensive under Trump's proposed tariffs.",
      "Any added costs on U.S. imports from the three counties \"will be shared by our customers,\" Barry told investors on Nov. 26, noting that \"there's very little in [the] consumer electronics space that is not imported.\"",
      "\"Pre-tariff\" sales",
      "And on Facebook, a Dallas, Texas-based furniture store called Finally Home Furnishings, announced a \"pre-tariff sale\" that runs until January, earlier this month.",
      "\"Get a deal while you still can,\" the retailer said.",
      "Finally Home Furnishings did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, or indicate how much it expects it may need to hike prices if new tariffs go into effect.",
      "Etsy seller Buzzy Park, who sells handmade bamboo picture frames, also advertised a \"pre-tariff \" sale on his entire inventory, starting this month and lasting until any new tariffs go into effect. \"Hurry and get them at their current prices,\" Park wrote in a social media post.",
      "While prices on variety of goods, ranging from shoes to vacuum cleaners, could indeed rise, some marketing and retail experts say that even sellers who don't expect to face added costs could be using potential tariffs as an excuse to charge customers more.",
      "\"If consumers panic about things getting more expensive, they are playing right into the hands of companies around the country to use it as an excuse to raise prices, even when it's not necessary,\" said Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a public policy research group. \"",

      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",

      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",

    "story": [
      "The mother of Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for defense secretary, defended her son Wednesday morning in an appearance on Fox News, following reporting on an email she sent to her son years earlier accusing him of being an \"abuser of women.\"",
      "Penelope Hegseth, appearing on \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday morning, said her son and his wife at the time were going through a \"very difficult divorce\" when she wrote the email in 2018,\u00a0 noting that she wrote it \"in haste\" and with \"deep emotions.\"",
      "\"I wrote that out of love,\" she said. \"And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology email, but nobody's seen that.\"",
      "Hegseth's mother said in the email, published by The New York Times, that she was writing on \"behalf of all the women (and I know it's many) you have abused in some way,\" telling her son to \"get some help and take an honest look at yourself.\"",
      "But Hegseth's mother said she was appearing Wednesday on Fox to \"tell the truth\" to the American people, and to Republican senators on the hill \u2014 \"especially our female senators.\"",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends\" weekend co-host, has been meeting with Republican senators on Capitol Hill this week and before the Thanksgiving recess, looking to secure support as the chamber prepares to work on the confirmation of Trump intended Cabinet and administration nominees early next year. Meanwhile, Hegseth has faced allegations in a number of negative stories published in recent days of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity. Hegseth has denied the allegations.",
      "Hegseth's mother encouraged the senators to \"listen to Pete,\" noting that part of the reason she appeared on Fox was to \"discredit the media.\" She added that she called Fox on Tuesday saying she wanted to speak out on the issue, noting that \"I would do anything for my son.\"",
      "Trump selected the 44-year-old Army veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan for the top Pentagon post last month. Since then, he's faced intense scrutiny, and amid the scrutiny, Trump is considering selecting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as his pick for defense secretary to potentially replace embattled Hegseth, three sources familiar with the transition told CBS News on Tuesday night.",
      "Hegseth insisted on Wednesday that he would not be withdrawing his name from consideration. He wouldn't be the first Trump nominee to withdraw: Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, initially Trump's pick to be attorney general, dropped out of consideration just days after he was tapped for the role.",
      "\"Why would I back down?\" Hegseth told CBS News. \"I've always been a fighter. I'm here for the fighters. This is personal and passionate for me.\"",
      "Hegseth's mother repeatedly defended her son during the appearance on Wednesday, saying he has changed and noting that \"if we all went back seven years, we would see that maybe we are not the people we are today.\"",
      "Hegseth's mother thanked Trump for his \"belief\" in her son.",
      "\"Trump knows Pete,\" she said. \"And he knows the Pete of today.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 09:59:14 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court is weighing whether Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria violates the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is weighing for the first time whether states can restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, stepping into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth.",
      "Roughly half of the states have enacted laws that prohibit puberty blockers or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18, and the dispute brought by the Biden administration, three families and a doctor tests whether states cross a constitutional line when regulating medical care that transgender adolescents argue is crucial to their well-being.",
      "Oral arguments in the case, known as U.S. v. Skrmetti, are streaming live in the player above.",
      "The case involves a Tennessee law known as SB1 that was\u00a0adopted in March 2023. It bars health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in prohibiting treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Puberty blockers and hormones are allowed when prescribed to treat a congenital defect, precocious puberty or other disease. The law went into effect on July 1, 2023, but transgender adolescents who started treatment before then had until March 31 to phase out their medication.",
      "Tennessee's law is part of a wave of measures passed by GOP-led states in recent years prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. President-elect Donald Trump has also pledged to restrict medical treatments for transgender adolescents and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, another area where states have enacted bans.",
      "U.S. v. Skrmetti",
      "State lawmakers have argued that they are trying to protect young people from \"the life-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition interventions,\" and have said the treatments are \"risky\" and \"unproven.\" The law, Tennessee officials told the Supreme Court in filings, sets age- and use-based limits on medical care, and is a routine exercise of the state's authority to regulate medicine.",
      "\"The government second-guesses elected lawmakers' judgment and asks this court to do the same,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued in a filing with the high court. \"But this court should not snuff out legislative developments in an evolving area by enshrining the government's skewed science into the Constitution.\"",
      "But the Biden administration, along with the three Tennessee families and Memphis doctor, assert the state's ban draws sex-based lines and discriminates based on transgender status, a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "\"An adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can. And vice versa, an adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in a brief. \"That is sex discrimination.\"",
      "Shortly before Tennessee's law took effect, the families with transgender children and Dr. Susan Lacy, who provided gender-affirming care to patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria, challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status and is likely unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the \"benefits of the medical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established,\" and said the law bars treatments for \"a tiny fraction of minors, while leaving them available to all other minors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\"",
      "A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued. The measure, the court found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "Both the Biden administration and the families, represented by the ACLU, separately asked the Supreme Court to review the 6th Circuit's decision. The high court in June agreed to do so, but took up only the Biden administration's appeal, which asked the justices to decide whether Tennessee's law violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents had argued the law infringed on their due process right to make decisions about their children's medical care, but the justices are not considering that question.",
      "Among the issues the Biden administration has asked the Supreme Court to consider is whether the 6th Circuit applied the wrong standard when evaluating the constitutionality of Tennessee's law. The lower court held that the ban is subject to rational-basis review, the most deferential of the three tiers of scrutiny. But Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has argued the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with the Biden administration, it could send the case back to the lower court to apply that more demanding standard, as Prelogar is asking it to do.",
      "Prelogar is set to argue on behalf of the U.S. on Wednesday, and she will share time with Chase Strangio of the ACLU, who will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court. Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice will present the state's case to the justices.",
      "The case is the most significant involving transgender rights that the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, has heard in years. In 2020, the high court divided 6-3 in finding that Title VII's protections from discrimination in the workplace extend to gay and transgender employees. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal members joined.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in this case is expected by the end of June.",

Duff sought Hegseth's removal from leadership roles in the veterans' group, CBS News has learned.",
      "While she worked at Concerned Veterans for America as a senior military adviser, Duff allegedly complained about Hegseth's frequent public intoxication, poor leadership and the toxic work climate he fostered within the organization, according to Republican insiders with knowledge of the matter. She also allegedly slighted Hegseth for his service in the National Guard, underscoring that he had only been a \"part-time\" soldier and not a full-time active-duty servicemember, according to Republican insiders who spoke to CBS News. Two sources said Hegseth fired Duff from Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "Tax filings show Hegseth became a director at Veterans for Freedom in 2006 and executive director in 2007. In 2008, filings show the organization raised over $8.7 million in revenue \u2014 but spent over $9 million, including significant sums on media buys and events and initiatives.",
      "By 2010,\u00a0tax filings show revenue had dropped to just under $265,000. In the nonprofit's 2011 filing, Hegseth was listed as an \"officer,\" rather than its executive director.",

    "summary": "The apparent hackers targeted Kash Patel's communications, but whether they succeeded and how much access they had to the data is still being investigated, the sources said.",
    "story": [
      "Kash Patel, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the FBI, was the target of a potential Iran-backed cyberattack, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "\"Kash Patel was a key part of the first Trump administration's efforts against the terrorist Iranian regime and will implement President Trump's policies to protect America from adversaries as the FBI Director,\" said transition spokesman Alex Pfeiffer.",
      "The apparent hackers targeted his communications, but whether they succeeded and how much access they had to the data is still being evaluated, the sources said.",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The news of Iran's potential targeting of Patel was first reported by Semafor.",
      "This comes after months of warnings from the FBI and other federal agencies of Iranian cyber activity targeting Trump campaign staff leading up the 2024 presidential election. In September, Justice Department prosecutors charged three members of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps with launching a broad hacking campaign against U.S. officials, including those close to Trump.",
      "In August, Microsoft said that Iran was increasing its efforts to influence the November election, and in one case had targeted a presidential campaign with an email phishing attack.",
      "Trump and his allies, including members of his first administration, have been targets of Iran since the 2020 killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. airstrike in Baghdad, and U.S. officials continued to warn of those cyberattack campaigns in recent months.",
      "The 44-year-old Patel\u00a0served\u00a0in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, including chief of staff to the secretary of defense.

    "title": "Supreme Court to confront gender-affirming care for transgender minors",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 08:55:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to hear arguments in a landmark case involving access to gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "The case concerns the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that bans this medical care for transgender adolescents. Half the states have measures on the books that are similar to Tennessee's, and advocates for transgender rights are warning that if the Supreme Court upholds the ban, it would open the door to state lawmakers outlawing gender-affirming care for adults.",
      "The dispute is the first in which the justices will consider the constitutionality of state efforts to regulate medical interventions for transgender youth, but it comes as Republican-led states have enacted a slew of restrictions targeting transgender individuals, including policies on\u00a0sports teams and restroom access.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restrict medical treatments for transgender minors and bar transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. And while the Biden administration will argue Wednesday that the Supreme Court should invalidate Tennessee's law, the incoming Trump administration could reverse the government's position once it is in power early next year.",
      "That shift in stance, though, may not preclude the high court from issuing a decision in the case, expected by the end of June.",
      "\"It's very difficult for these teenagers, who already face a difficult scenario, when there's this institutional governmental rejection of who they are,\" said Dr. Susan Lacy, a Memphis-based physician who challenged Tennessee's law alongside three families. \"That's very difficult to be told either you don't know who you are \u2014 being told that you're wrong, you don't know what you're talking about, your parents are trying to manipulate you, all of that kind of rhetoric is really difficult for these kids.\"",
      "Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's Republican-led legislature approved its ban on certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria in March 2023. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been used to treat gender dysphoria for decades, but in the past three years, GOP-controlled state legislatures have adopted measures restricting access to these treatments for minors.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits health care providers from administering any puberty blocker or hormone if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identity with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argues that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring procedures that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The use of these treatments for conditions such as precocious puberty, congenital defects or other diseases is allowed in Tennessee.",
      "The Biden administration argues that Tennessee's ban draws lines based on sex and discriminates against transgender people, in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The Justice Department has argued that the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, rather than the more relaxed standard applied by the lower court, rational basis review.",
      "\"Most immediately, SB1 prohibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their doctors from making critically important and intensely personal decisions about the appropriate medical treatment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical condition,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue on behalf of the federal government, wrote in a filing with the high court.",
      "But Tennessee officials assert that the law is a routine exercise of state power to regulate medicine, and it is medical use and purpose \u2014 not sex \u2014 that dictate the availability of treatments. The state, they have said, is trying to protect children from the \"life-altering risks\" of gender-affirming care, which they said is \"risky\" and \"unproven.\"",
      "\"While the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\" state officials wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "The challenge before the high court was brought by three families and Lacy, who began providing gender-affirming care eight years ago. One of the challengers, a transgender girl identified in court filings as L.W., was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of 12 and began taking puberty blockers, followed by hormones.",
      "Today, the state's ban means L.W., now 16, must travel to another state to receive her treatments.",
      "\"Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,\" Brian Williams, L.W.'s father, told reporters in a press call hosted by the ACLU. \"It infringes not only on her freedom to be herself, but on our family's love for her.\"",
      "The ACLU is representing the families who challenged Tennessee's law. Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the group, will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court when he participates in oral arguments Wednesday.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Biden administration and the challengers, finding that Tennessee's ban likely violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled the law discriminates based on sex and targets transgender people, and said the benefits of the health care outlawed by the law are \"well-established.\"",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and allowed Tennessee's law to take effect. The measure, the divided panel found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "The Biden administration and the families appealed the 6th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the ruling.",
      "A \"sense of mental clarity\"",
      "The Williams Institute, a think tank that conducts research on sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates there are roughly 1.6 million people ages 13 and older who identify as transgender. There are more than 300,000 transgender youth between the ages of 13 and 17 who live in states where access to puberty blockers and hormones is restricted, according to the center.",
      "Daniel Trujillo, a 17-year-old transgender boy who lives in Tucson, Arizona, began social transitioning when he was 8 years old and was prescribed puberty blockers after years of discussions between his parents, pediatrician and, later, a clinical psychologist.",
      "\"I myself am proof that gender-affirming care works and it helps people and it saves lives,\" he told CBS News. \"When I was experiencing a lot of dysphoria, it was really hard for me to focus on things that mattered. I couldn't focus on school. I was very anxious and internalizing whatever I was experiencing, and once I was able to feel more comfortable in myself and feel affirmed with me, as who I am, my parents were able to see the shift, my friends and family could see the shift.\"",
      "In 2022, then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that prohibits \"irreversible gender reassignment surgery\" for minors. An earlier version of the proposal would have also outlawed puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but it failed in a state senate committee.",
      "Still, Lizette Trujillo, Daniel's mother, said that had the state banned those treatments, the family would have moved elsewhere to ensure her son could continue to receive medical care.",
      "\"That felt really scary, because here is my child who is emotionally well, who has maintained strong self-esteem, feels love, he's doing well. And then to have the state infringe on our right and totally change our trajectory or change his life felt awful, it felt scary and felt unjust,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Medical interventions in minors experiencing gender dysphoria began in Europe in the late 1990s, when Dutch health care providers started offering puberty blockers. In 1998, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended puberty blockers at the start of puberty and hormone treatment for transgender youth at 16.",
      "In recent years, though, some health authorities in European nations have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth.",
      "Sonia Suter, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said the Supreme Court could side with Tennessee and conclude that it should give deference to the state legislature in regulating health care because of medical uncertainty and disagreement among experts.",
      "Citing an independent review from the United Kingdom, after which England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria, Suter that it could \"make it easy for the U.S. Supreme Court to say, you know what, there is clearly medical uncertainty here and therefore we're not going to second-guess.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Tennessee officials warn that treatments for gender dysphoria carry health risks, such as negative impacts to fertility, diminished bone density and a higher risk of cancer.",
      "But Lacy, the provider who has roughly 700 transgender patients out of roughly 3,000 who visit her practice, said she has not seen any major complications affecting long-term health.",
      "\"When I first started providing trans care, the most compelling piece of it was that, prior to any sort of physical changes or obvious transitional changes, the first thing that people would tell me is that they felt like there was sort of a sense of mental clarity that they experienced,\" she said.",
      "If not treated, gender dysphoria can lead to physical and psychological harms, the Biden administration has warned, including depression and self-harm. Up to one-third of transgender high school students attempt suicide in a given year, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"It's this goose chase trying to find safety, which is not the American dream that everyone talks about,\" Daniel Trujillo said of the patchwork of state laws restricting gender-affirming care. \"All American citizens should be able to live freely wherever they want to and live fully wherever they want to.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.",
      "Yoon said his government withdrew military personnel following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected martial law, and the measure was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.",
      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",
      "In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge dismissed the gun case against Hunter Biden on Tuesday after President Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son.",
      "U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika closed the case the week before Hunter Biden was to be sentenced. He could have faced up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he likely would have gotten far less time or avoided prison entirely.",
      "Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents that a pardon shouldn't wipe away the case \"as if it never occurred.\" Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn't a drug user in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted.",
      "The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing a case filed in California after Hunter Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles indicated he would dismiss the case once the pardon is formally received.",
      "Still, Scarsi was critical of the president's assertion that his son was singled out for political reasons, saying two judges had rejected similar arguments from his defense attorneys.",
      "The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Mr. Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20.",
      "In their own motion Tuesday, lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump cited the pardon in a request that Trump's conviction in the New York \"hush money\" case be dismissed.",
      "Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.",
      "In his statement announcing the pardon, Mr. Biden said that \"from the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.\"",
      "Mr. Biden alleged that his son \"was treated differently\" than others in similar circumstances and that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "The pardon applies to any crimes Hunter may have committed between Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork in order to purchase a gun in October 2018 while he was addicted to illegal drugs. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "In June, a Delaware jury found him guilty of one count each of making a false statement in the purchase of a firearm, making a false statement related to information required to be kept by a federally licensed firearms dealer, and possession of a firearm by a person who is an unlawful user of or addicted to a controlled substance.",
      "Then in September, Hunter reached a plea deal on nine counts in a federal tax evasion case in Los Angeles. He faced up to 17 years in prison in that case prior to the pardon.",

    "summary": "The concern could put another one of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks at risk of falling short of the support needed for confirmation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A number of Republican senators have expressed concern about Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Defense Department, potentially putting his intended nomination at risk.",
      "Hegseth, who has been meeting with Senate Republicans on Capitol Hill this week to try to build support ahead of his confirmation hearings, has faced a round of negative stories involving allegations of sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity.",
      "\"Some of these articles are very disturbing. He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is, it's going to be difficult,\" Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told reporters Tuesday. \"Time will tell.\"",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, also said he found the allegations \"disturbing\" but added, \"We all love a good redemption story.\" Cramer suggested Hegseth's alleged behavior stemmed from alcohol abuse, adding that \"almost everything else can come from that one abuse.\"",
      "Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana, who noted he has also read the reporting and is aware of the allegations, said Hegseth will have to address them.",
      "\"I want to know if they are true and I want to hear his side of the story and he is going to have to address them,\" he said Tuesday, adding that he wasn't sure if Hegseth's nomination would face headwinds.",
      "On Monday, the New Yorker reported that before he became a full-time Fox News host, Hegseth was forced to step down from two nonprofit advocacy groups \u2014 Veterans for Freedom and Concerned Veterans for America \u2014 amid complaints about his alleged behavior that included repeatedly being intoxicated while on the job, leading a hostile work environment and mismanaging the charities' funds. CBS News reported that Jessie Jane Duff, a Marine veteran who served as one of Trump's 2024 campaign executive directors, was among those who pushed to have him ousted from Concerned Veterans for America in 2016.",
      "A lawyer for Hegseth has denied the allegations.",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican, said Tuesday that the allegations \"are a surprise to all of us\" and that his ability to be confirmed by the Senate \"depends on how he addresses the issues that have been raised.\" Lummis said the allegations also came as a surprise to Trump.",
      "\"Some of the earlier issues that were raised about an incident in California, I think were satisfactorily addressed and would not have interfered with his nomination, but some new things that have come to light in the last 12 to 14 hours are things he needs to address,\" she said.",
      "Hegseth, an Army veteran turned Fox News star, was investigated for sexual assault\u00a0in 2017 in Monterey, California. Authorities declined to file charges in the case, saying none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Hegseth told investigators that the sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and he has denied any wrongdoing. He paid a confidential settlement to the woman out of concern that her accusation could result in his firing from Fox News, his lawyer said after the claims became public in mid-November.",
      "But Sen. Tommy Tuberville pushed back on the notion that Trump may have concern about his pick.",
      "\"I talked to him last night,\" the Alabama Republican said Tuesday. \"I don't think there's any concern. Why would there be?\"",
      "Asked Monday whether he thought the Senate would confirm him to lead the Pentagon, Hegseth said he was \"taking it meeting by meeting.\"",

      "Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, announced Tuesday he is withdrawing his name from consideration, citing the goals he has yet to complete as sheriff of Hillsborough County, Florida.",
      "Calling it \"the honor of a lifetime\" to have been nominated, Chronister said in a social media post on X, \"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration. There is more work to be done for the citizens of Hillsborough County and a lot of initiatives I am committed to fulfilling.\"",
      "Trump had announced Saturday that he'd tap the Republican Florida sheriff to be the DEA's administrator and help to \"stop the flow of Fentanyl, and other Illegal Drugs across the Southern Border.\"",
      "Chronister has been sheriff of Florida's Hillsborough County since he was appointed to the role by then-Gov. Rick Scott 2017, and he has won reelection twice. He has been with the department for 32 years. Hillsborough County includes much of the Tampa Bay metro area.",
      "The outgoing DEA administrator is Anne Milgram, who has held the role for nearly all of President Biden's term.",
      "The DEA, which is part of the Justice Department, has approximately 10,000 employees and is tasked with enforcing America's drug laws. Among its major edicts has been addressing the opioid crisis.",
      "In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in September, Milgram said the U.S. is \"losing a generation\" to fentanyl.",
      "\"As complex and as massive a problem as this is, it's also not a whodunit. We know who's responsible,\" Milgram said. \"It's the Sinaloa Cartel and the Jalisco Cartel that are based in Mexico. They dominate and control the entire global fentanyl supply chain, starting in China, going to Mexico, coming into the United States.\"",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to crack down on illegal immigration and drug trafficking, and this week, Trump followed through by threatening to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on both Mexico and Canada until those issues are properly addressed to his liking.",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's attorneys mentioned Hunter Biden in a filing arguing the New York criminal case against the president-elect should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's lawyers pointed to an unlikely person in demanding a judge dismiss the president-elect's New York criminal case: Hunter Biden.",
      "Trump's attorneys said in a court filing made public Tuesday that President Joe Biden's controversial pardon of his son echoed Trump's complaints about the prosecution.",
      "\"Yesterday, in issuing a 10-year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'\" they wrote, before claiming Trump was treated similarly.",
      "In the filing, which was submitted Monday night, they formally demanded a New York judge throw out the president-elect's criminal case and nullify a unanimous jury's conclusion that Trump committed dozens of felonies.",
      "Their argument struck at the quality of the case against Trump, but centers largely on a wholly unique argument in the history of America's legal system. Trump's lawyers said his conviction in state court should not stand because he was elected president after his conviction.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have vowed to oppose the dismissal motion, and have been given a one-week deadline to file their response. They pursued the case amid a torrent of public threats of retribution by Trump's allies, and anonymous threats of violence by his supporters.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued in their filing that the Constitution requires dismissal of the case, even though it's already progressed though trial, because ongoing proceedings threaten to take Trump's attention from the presidency.",
      "\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" wrote his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, each of whom are slated to take on high-level positions at the Justice Department after Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Trump's sentencing was recently postponed for a third time. After he was convicted in May, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for July 11. In the interim, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling concluding that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "The first sentencing postponement came because Trump's attorneys wanted to file a motion to dismiss based on that Supreme Court ruling. Merchan has yet to rule on that motion.",
      "They then asked for and were granted a postponement of the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, arguing that it was too close to the election.",
      "After Trump won the presidency on Nov. 5, his attorneys quickly indicated they'd make Monday's request. In Trump's filing, his attorneys refer to his election victory as \"overwhelming.\"",
      "Bragg's office has floated postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" they wrote in a Nov. 19 letter to Merchan.",
      "The Manhattan case against Trump set a series of unprecedented firsts. He was the first person in American history to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the anonymous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. The case against Trump began when a grand jury in March 2023 made him the first former president ever indicted.",
      "The case revolved around a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before his first election to office in 2016. While in office, Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment to the actress just days before Trump's first election.",
      "Trump entered a not guilty plea in the case and promised minutes after his conviction that he would fight the jury's decision.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0President Biden announced late Sunday that he issued a pardon for his son Hunter Biden, in a major reversal in the final weeks of his presidency.",
      "Mr. Biden repeatedly pledged not to pardon his son, who was\u00a0convicted in June of three separate felony charges\u00a0related to his purchase of a revolver in 2018 when he was battling an addiction to illegal drugs, which he lied about on paperwork to obtain the gun. He also pleaded guilty to nine tax evasion charges in a separate case in September.",
      "\"Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "The president argued that \"Hunter was treated differently\" than others under similar circumstances, claiming that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",
      "\"No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2014  and that is wrong,\" Mr. Biden said.",

      "Mr. Biden did not address the pardon with reporters before boarding Air Force One for his trip to Angola.",
      "Hunter Biden charges and allegations",
      "Hunter Biden was investigated and prosecuted by special counsel David Weiss, the Trump-appointed U.S. attorney in Delaware who was kept on by Mr. Biden's administration in 2021, when other Trump-era prosecutors were asked to resign, in order to continue the probes into Hunter's conduct. Attorney General Merrick Garland later elevated Weiss to special counsel status after whistleblowers and congressional Republicans alleged irregularities in the probe.",
      "Weiss' office declined to comment on the pardon.",
      "Joseph Ziegler and Gary Shapley, two IRS whistleblowers who came forward to raise concerns about what they said were the Justice Department's efforts to shield Hunter Biden, said in a statement that it was \"a sad day for law abiding taxpayers to witness this special privilege for the powerful.\"",
      "Before dropping out of the race for president, Mr. Biden had committed not to pardon his son,\u00a0saying in an interview with ABC News in June that he had ruled it out. After opting to\u00a0leave the race\u00a0the next month, the White House maintained that Mr. Biden had no plans to pardon his son, though the possible political consequences of the decision had decreased. The White House\u00a0said\u00a0as recently as last month that the president still had no plans to issue a pardon.",
      "\"I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction \u2014 mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport. Despite all of this, I have maintained my sobriety for more than five years because of my deep faith and the unwavering love and support of my family and friends,\" Hunter Biden said in a statement Sunday night.",
      "\"I will never take the clemency I have been given today for granted and will devote the life I have rebuilt to helping those who are still sick and suffering,\" the president's son said.",
      "Hunter Biden was set to be sentenced for the gun convictions on Dec. 12 and on Dec. 16 for the tax evasion charges.",
      "Following the White House announcement of the pardon, Hunter Biden's legal team informed the federal judges overseeing his cases in Delaware and California about the pardon so the cases can be formally dismissed and the sentencing hearings set for later this month be canceled.",
      "Hunter Biden was\u00a0indicted on three felony gun charges\u00a0in September after a proposed plea deal with federal prosecutors\u00a0fell apart. The deal would have had him plead guilty to two misdemeanor tax charges and enter a diversion program instead of pleading guilty to a felony gun possession count.",
      "During the court hearing in which the plea deal was set to be finalized, the judge overseeing the case raised concerns over the terms while Hunter Biden's legal team pushed back against prosecutors over whether the agreement was to protect the president's son from any future criminal charges.",
      "Hunter Biden was accused of lying on paperwork and illegally purchasing and possessing a gun while he was addicted to crack cocaine. Federal law prohibits users of illegal drugs from owning firearms.",
      "Prosecutors said the president's son lied about his drug use on a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives form when he bought a revolver and several other items from a Wilmington, Delaware, gun store on Oct. 12, 2018.",
      "In the separate case in California, a federal grand jury last December\u00a0charged Hunter Biden\u00a0with three felony tax offenses and six misdemeanor offenses. The president's son was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in federal taxes while living an \"extravagant lifestyle.\"",
      "According to the indictment, Hunter Biden made some $7 million in income from his foreign business dealings from 2016 through 2019. He was accused of spending nearly $5 million during that same time period on \"everything but his taxes,\" including on drugs, escorts, luxury hotels, cars and clothing. Hunter Biden was accused of falsely listing those purchases as business expenses.",
      "After unsuccessfully attempting to enter an \"Alford\" plea, wherein a defendant accepts a guilty verdict while maintaining their innocence, Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the tax evasion charges on Sept. 5.",
      "\"Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form,\" Mr. Biden said Sunday night. \"Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.\"",
      "Special counsel response",
      "Weiss argued in a court filing on Monday that Hunter Biden's cases should not be dismissed, but rather closed by the judge overseeing them. The Justice Department said Monday they have not yet seen the order of clemency signed by Mr. Biden for his son.",
      "Weiss argued the cases against Hunter Biden were not defective and as a result, should not be dismissed. He says the judges should follow precedent form other cases in which defendants received pardons and simply close the case and docket the notice of clemency on the public docket.",
      "\"If media reports are accurate, the Government does not challenge that the defendant has been the recipient of an act of mercy,\" Weiss said in the filing. \"But that does not mean the grand jury's decision to charge him, based on a finding of probable cause, should be wiped away as if it never occurred. It also does not mean that his charges should be wiped away because the defendant falsely claimed that the charges were the result of some improper motive. No court has agreed with the defendant on these baseless claims, and his request to dismiss the indictment finds no support in the law or the practice of this district.\"",
      "Without specifically calling out Mr. Biden by name, Weiss also pushed back on criticism of the probe, writing, \"there was none and never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case.\"",
      "White House response",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged questions about the president's reversal on Monday, reiterating portions of the president's statement while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One. She outlined that Mr. Biden made the decision over the weekend, saying that he \"agonized\" over it.",
      "While insisting Mr. Biden believes in the Justice Department, Jean-Pierre said that \"politics infected the process,\" arguing that \"both things could be true.\" She said the president is not seeking the resignation of the attorney general, and said Mr. Biden does not agree with President-elect Donald Trump that the DOJ has been weaponized for political purposes or needs reform.",
      "Jean-Pierre suggested that the decision came in part because the president didn't think his political opponents would let up.",
      "\"One of the reasons the president did the pardon is because it didn't seem like his political opponents would let go of it,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It didn't seem like they would move on.\"",
      "Biden family reaction",
      "First lady Jill Biden told reporters on Monday \"of course I support the pardon of my son.\"",
      "The first lady and daughter Ashley were often present during Hunter Biden's trial to show their support for him. Hunter Biden, his wife Melissa and son Beau Jr. all spent Thanksgiving weekend on Nantucket with Mr. Biden, Jill Biden and Ashley.",
      "Reaction to the pardon",
      "On social media, Trump called the Biden pardon \"an abuse and miscarriage of Justice!\"",
      "Other Republicans on Sunday and Monday decried the pardon. House Speaker Mike Johnson posted X that \"trust in our justice system has been almost irreparably damaged by the Bidens and their use and abuse of it.\"",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley wrote that is he is \"shocked\" about the pardon because Mr. Biden \"said many many times he wouldn't & I believed him[.] Shame on me.\"",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, meanwhile, wrote on Sunday that as a father, he understands Mr. Biden's desire to pardon his son, but said he was \"disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later Presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.\"",
      "But former Obama administration Attorney General Eric Holder said on Sunday night \"pardon warranted,\" posting on social media that had Hunter Biden's \"name been Joe Smith the resolution would have been - fundamentally and more fairly - a declination.\"",
      "Holder also mentioned Trump's announcement over the weekend that he wanted Kash Patel to lead the FBI, saying \"ask yourself a vastly more important question. Do you really think Kash Patel is qualified to lead the world's preeminent law enforcement investigative organization? Obvious answer: hell no.\"",
      "Presidential pardons",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person to receive a pardon during Mr. Biden's presidency. Most of the others received pardons for drug offenses. Trump granted\u00a029 pardons\u00a0at this point in his first term, but issued a total of 143 pardons by the time he left office in 2020.",
      "This is not the first time a president has pardoned a family member. President Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother, Roger Clinton, before leaving office. Trump pardoned his son-in-law's father, Charles Kushner, during his first term. Trump announced that he intends to\u00a0nominate Kushner\u00a0as U.S. ambassador to France on Saturday.",
      "The two federal cases against Hunter Biden came amid a backdrop of Republican-led congressional inquiries into his business dealings and whether they involved Mr. Biden. The president has maintained he had nothing to do with his son's businesses and the investigative committees produced no evidence showing the president engaged in wrongdoing.",

    "summary": "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday issued a sweeping pardon of his son Hunter, who was convicted earlier this year on federal gun and drug charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges in California.",
      "The presidential pardoning process is one that has long courted controversy, especially since many presidents issue pardons when they are leaving the White House.",
      "One of the most famous \u2014and controversial\u2014 pardons in history happened less than one month into President Gerald Ford's term. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford announced from the Oval Office that he would \"grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.\" Ford's own press secretary resigned over the pardon, and Ford's approval rating dropped 20 points over the following days. His approval rating never recovered and he went on to lose the 1976 presidential election.",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers were heavily influenced by the English legal tradition of pardon, which dates back to the 7th century, and Alexander Hamilton introduced the concept of the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention.",
      "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares: \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "There are four different types of clemency that fall under the president's pardoning power: pardon, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.\u00a0 As outlined by the White House, a pardon releases a person from punishment and restores all civil liberties; amnesty is the same as the pardon but is extended to an entire class of individuals; commutation reduces the sentence imposed by a federal court, and a reprieve delays the imposition of a sentence or punishment.",
      "Pardons, however, may not be issued in cases of impeachment or if it is an \"offense against the United States,\" such as treason.",
      "The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.",
      "To be pardoned, a person must have been convicted in a United States District Court, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or a military court-martial \u2014 so a president cannot issue a pardon for a state conviction.",
      "What does a pardon mean for the pardoned person?",
      "A pardon can help eliminate some of the consequences of conviction and restore a person's civil rights.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the offense is not removed from a person's criminal record when they are pardoned but instead the conviction and the pardon both appear on the record. But the pardon can be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding or employment.",
      "Who has Biden pardoned while in office?",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person Mr. Biden has pardoned so far. Most pardons relate to drug offenses, a practice started by former President Barack Obama. In September 2023, Mr. Biden granted clemency for three Iranians who were accused of moving $6 billion in a restricted Iranian account as part of a prisoner swap.",
      "At this point in President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he had pardoned 29 people.",
      "Who did Trump pardon during his first term?",
      "Trump issued a slew of pardons on Jan. 19, 2021, shortly before he left office. Trump pardoned 74 people and commuted the sentences of another 70.",
      "Among those pardoned were Steve Bannon, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy, Albert J. Pirro and rapper Lil Wayne.",
      "Prior to those pardons, Trump pardoned more than 30 people in December 2020, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions in 2005. Ahead of his second term, Trump has nominated Charles Kushner to be the ambassador to France.",
      "Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u00a0Dinesh D'Souza, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, former George W. Bush aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby and Oregon ranchers Dwight L. Hammond and Steve D. Hammond.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued a full pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence he had commuted in 2018 after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. Johnson is a great-grandmother who had served 22 years in federal prison for what was a first-time criminal offense, which had come to Kardashian's attention.",
      "In total over four years in office, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. The only presidents since 1900 who issued fewer acts of clemency were George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center.",
      "Who did Obama pardon while in office?",
      "Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations while in office, including for 568 people who were serving life sentences. In 2014, Obama launched the Clemency Initiative, which allowed federal prisoners to apply for leniency, especially those serving for nonviolent drug offenses. In the\u00a0Obama White House archives, his administration touts that those whose sentences were commuted were \"incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws.\"",
      "Although Obama encouraged prisoners to apply for leniency under the Clemency Initiative, a report by the Justice Department Inspector General in 2018 found that initiative was poorly planned and not implemented properly, while also suffering from poor communication and bureaucratic feuds.",
      "\"We found that the Department did not effectively plan, implement, or manage the Initiative at the outset,\" Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in the report.",
      "Which president has pardoned the most people in history?",
      "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served 13 years in office, issued the most pardons: 3,687.",
      "Have past presidents pardoned family members?",
      "Although Mr. Biden is the first president to pardon his son, he is not the first to pardon a family member. Former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger Clinton and Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father.",
      "Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, pardoned his sister-in-law, Emilie Todd Helm, who was the widow of a Confederate general, under the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction.",
      "Can a president issue a preemptive pardon?",
      "Ford's infamous pardon of Nixon was a preemptive pardon, since Nixon had not been charged with a crime. Former President Jimmy Carter also issued preemptive pardons for Vietnam draft evaders, as did Lincoln in the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which allowed for former Confederates to be pardoned if they took an oath to the U.S.",
      "President George H.W. Bush also pardoned his secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, along with five others, for his alleged role in the Iran-Contra scandal after he was indicted but before his trial.",
      "Mr. Biden's pardon of Hunter covers any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024, even if he has not yet been charged. Hunter Biden's first plea agreement in Delaware fell apart because his lawyers sought full immunity from future prosecution.",
      "Can another president undo a previous presidential pardon?",
      "The pardon language in Article II of the Constitution does not include any language about revoking pardons, although only a few presidents have exercised that power.",
      "On President Andrew Johnson's last day in office, he issued several pardons \u2014 three of which President Ulysses S. Grant reversed on his first day by calling back the U.S. Marshal so they were never delivered. A fourth was allowed to stand since it had been delivered.",
      "According to Washington Monthly, an 1868 textbook by Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph Story on the Constitution says a presidential pardon can be revoked if the president was impeached. In recent history, both Clinton and Trump have been impeached \u2014 although their pardons did stand after their terms.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, meanwhile, revoked one of his own pardons. In December 2008, shortly before leaving office, Bush pardoned 19 people, including\u00a0 Isaac Robert Toussie of Brooklyn, N.Y., who had been convicted of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and of mail fraud.",
      "One day later, Bush reversed the decision, with White House press secretary Dana Perino citing \"information that has subsequently come to light,\" including on the extent and nature of Toussie's prior criminal offenses. She also said that neither the White House counsel's office nor the president had been aware of a political contribution by Toussie's father that \"might create an appearance of impropriety.\"",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans have celebrated holding onto their narrow majority in the House, adding to their flip of the Senate and the White House for a trifecta in Washington next year. But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January.",
      "Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while outlining the GOP agenda following the picks last month, said the president-elect \"fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" noting that he didn't expect the conference would lose any more members to Trump's administration.",
      "\"Every single vote will count because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane then it affects the votes on the floor,\" Johnson said.",
      "Then came Trump's pick of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, setting up three vacancies early in the new Congress. Gaetz resigned his seat immediately, hours after Trump announced his intent to nominate him.",
      "\"I told President Trump, 'enough already, you've got to give me some relief,'\" Johnson said on Fox News after Trump selected Gaetz for the role. \"I've got to maintain this majority.\"",
      "Though Gaetz has since withdrawn from consideration for the post, facing intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, he's said he does not intend to serve in the 119th Congress, giving Johnson another unwelcome vacancy.",
      "Johnson expressed optimism at the time of Gaetz' selection that with his immediate resignation from the chamber, his seat could be filled by the start of the new Congress, citing Florida state law's process. But Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0set the primary for Jan. 28, and the general election for April 1, which he said was the earliest date the special election could take place. Florida's secretary of state said the election was being conducted \"as quickly as statutorily possible.\"",
      "Waltz' seat is also set for an April 1 general election in Florida. And the special election for Stefanik's seat could take up to 90 days after she resigns. The dynamic could mean for months in the early days of the president-elect's second term, Republicans could have a majority that is as low as one or two seats, meaning that if all House members are present, Johnson could need the support of every single Republican. If he has a three-seat majority, he could afford to lose one Republican on some votes.",
      "The outcome may spell trouble for the GOP's ability to act on the mandate that Republicans have claimed since Trump's victory in the presidential election. (Although Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in both the electoral and popular votes, he did not win a majority of American voters.) House Republican leadership has struggled in recent years to keep the conference united on key priorities, with a reliable group of detractors on its right flank. While the conservatives, many of whom are Trump loyalists, may be more inclined to stay in line under a Trump administration than during President Biden's time in office, Johnson could face opposition from moderates in his party.",
      "House Republicans like Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington have previously been critical of Trump and could break with the party on some issues, imperiling some early legislative action. Bacon refused to back the president-elect during the primary, while Valadao and Newhouse are the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. After the election, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told USA Today that he would be willing to speak out against Trump amid GOP control of Washington to work in the best interest of his constituents.",
      "\"When I agree with the president, I'll say it. If I disagree on something, I will say that, too,\" Lawler said.",
      "Still, the exceedingly narrow majority created by Trump's appointments is expected to be short-lived, since all three seats are in safely Republican districts. Johnson expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to work with a smaller majority for as long is necessary, while pledging to \"be very aggressive\" and move forward with Trump's agenda beginning on Day One.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "title": "Why is Trump threatening a 100% tariff on the BRICS nations?",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",

    "summary": "Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Congress returns this week from a Thanksgiving recess with a number of priorities to get through before the end of the year, while a deadline to fund the government looms over lawmakers.",
      "With the new Congress set to be sworn in on Jan. 3, lawmakers are pushing through a list of to-dos in the coming weeks in the lame-duck session, while Republicans gear up for leadership in Washington next year.",
      "But first, Congress must address government funding, since lawmakers only have until Dec. 20 to approve new spending. And although a shutdown remains unlikely, leaders will need to reach an agreement on a short-term funding measure in the weeks ahead.",
      "Funding the government",
      "In September, lawmakers approved a continuing resolution to keep the government funded through Dec. 20, setting a pre-holiday deadline to prevent a shutdown that has become commonplace for Congress. With frustration among some conservatives over the practice, House Speaker Mike Johnson made clear at the time that he opposed an omnibus package to fund the government, suggesting that the House would work to approve the 12 full-year spending bills individually after the election. But the favorable results for Republicans in the 2024 elections appeared to change the calculus.",
      "Republicans appear likely to push to punt the deadline into the early days of President-elect Donald Trump's administration, though the exact timeline for the stopgap measure remains a key question. The deadline will tee up a larger fight over government spending, with Republicans set to control the House, Senate and the White House \u2014 and looking to make significant spending cuts while juggling the extension of Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Lawmakers also have disaster aid to consider after the Biden administration requested $98 billion in aid to address the aftermath of Hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southeast.",
      "The funding fight comes as Johnson is looking to hold onto his gavel in the new year, with a narrow House majority that's proven problematic for Republicans seeking the speakership in recent years. Republicans have already selected Johnson to be their nominee for speaker in January, and the full House will elect a speaker when lawmakers are sworn in next month.",
      "Senate Republicans meet with Trump's administration picks",
      "Senate Republicans are expected to continue meeting with Trump's picks for top posts in his administration this week, looking to secure support in the upper chamber, which has the role of confirming the intended nominees.",
      "Ahead of their recess, Senate Republicans met with Trump picks including Pete Hegseth and former Rep. Matt Gaetz, who then opted to withdraw his name from consideration for Attorney General following intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. On Monday, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa is set to meet with former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who Trump tapped for Attorney General after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Trump has continued to announce his picks for the top posts, including Kash Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term and has a reputation as a controversial figure, for FBI director. The announcement came as Trump-nominated Christopher Wray's term isn't set to expire until 2027.",
      "Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who Trump tapped to lead the newly coined Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, will also be on Capitol Hill this week, meeting Thursday with Senate and House Republicans.",
      "House Ethics Committee meets to consider Gaetz report",
      "The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Thursday to further consider whether to release the report about its investigation into Gaetz, after the evenly split bipartisan panel failed to reach an agreement in an hourslong meeting last month.",
      "A day later, Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration, further complicating the ethics committee's decision about whether to release the report. Gaetz' resignation from the House after his selection for attorney general had ended the committee's jurisdiction over him, making the release of the report all the more controversial. The Republican committee chairmen said he voted against the release of the report over the jurisdiction issue.",
      "Still, some view the report's release as essential if Gaetz is eyeing other offices, like another post within Trump's administration or running for Florida governor down the road.",
      "The Ethics Committee's investigation first began in 2021, but was put on pause as the Justice Department conducted a sex trafficking and obstruction probe of Gaetz. Last year, the Ethics Committee resumed its work, after prosecutors declined to charge Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Senate Democrats hold leadership elections",
      "Senate Democrats, who will be in the minority in the new Congress, are expected to meet Tuesday to elect their leadership for the next two years, after Republicans flipped the chamber in the 2024 elections.",
      "Though the top posts in Democratic leadership are expected to remain unchanged, with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and whip Dick Durbin seeking to remain in their roles, the no. 3 post is up for grabs as Sen. Debbie Stabenow set to retire.",
      "Stabenow, who is leaving the Senate after more than two decades, chairs the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee. The post has been eyed by Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.",
      "The leadership races come as Senate Democrats are making a final push on their agenda, with a focus on confirming President Biden's remaining nominees to the nation's courts. Democrats are hoping to meet or surpass Trump's 234 judicial confirmations from his first term during the lame-duck session, but have run into resistance from Republicans looking to hold up and drag out the process.",

      "Today, I signed a pardon for my son Hunter. From the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted. Without aggravating factors like use in a crime, multiple purchases, or buying a weapon as a straw purchaser, people are almost never brought to trial on felony charges solely for how they filled out a gun form. Those who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions, but paid them back subsequently with interest and penalties, are typically given non-criminal resolutions. It is clear that Hunter was treated differently.",
      "The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election. Then, a carefully negotiated plea deal, agreed to by the Department of Justice, unraveled in the court room \u2013 with a number of my political opponents in Congress taking credit for bringing political pressure on the process. Had the plea deal held, it would have been a fair, reasonable resolution of Hunter's cases.",
      "No reasonable person who looks at the facts of Hunter's cases can reach any other conclusion than Hunter was singled out only because he is my son \u2013 and that is wrong. There has been an effort to break Hunter \u2013 who has been five and a half years sober, even in the face of unrelenting attacks and selective prosecution. In trying to break Hunter, they've tried to break me \u2013 and there's no reason to believe it will stop here. Enough is enough.",
      "For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They'll be fair-minded. Here's the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice \u2013 and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further. I hope Americans will understand why a father and a President would come to this decision.",

    "summary": "Democrats and some former Trump officials criticized President-elect Donald Trump's announcement that he wants Kash Patel to be FBI director.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's announcement\u00a0Saturday that he intends to nominate Kash Patel as FBI director sent shockwaves through Washington over the weekend, prompting outrage from Democrats and even some former Trump officials, while some loyalists insisted they believed Patel would be confirmed by the Senate.",
      "Patel, a 44-year-old who served in intelligence and defense roles in Trump's first term, is a controversial figure even within Trump's world, and a former U.S. official described him as \"by far the most dangerous pick\" Trump has made.",
      "\"There is no 'there' to him,\" the official told CBS News. \"He'll literally do anything.\"",
      "John Bolton, who served as national security adviser in Trump's first term and was Patel's boss, compared the nomination to Joseph Stalin's secret police chief.",
      "\"Fortunately, the FBI is not\" Stalin's secret police, Bolton said. \"The Senate should reject this nomination 100-0.\"",
      "In response to Bolton's comments, Vice President-elect JD Vance posted on social media that \"John Bolton has been wrong about everything so I guess Kash must be pretty awesome.\"",
      "In addition to objections about Patel at the helm of the FBI, current FBI director Christopher Wray's 10-year term is not due to end until 2027. For Patel to become FBI director, Wray would have to resign or be fired by Trump and Patel would need to be confirmed by the Senate. Republicans are set to hold a 53-47 majority come January, giving incoming Majority Leader John Thune only a few votes to lose.",
      "Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\" in a post on social media Saturday. And some of his supporters echoed the sentiment, like Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, who said Patel is a \"very strong nominee\" whom he thinks will be approved by the Senate.",
      "\"I got to say, all of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all of the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI and clean out the corrupted partisans who sadly have burrowed into senior career positions at the FBI,\" Cruz said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Sen. Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that he \"encouraged President Trump to bring Kash Patel to the table,\" saying Patel \"represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI.\"",
      "Other Republicans, like Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, took a more cautious approach. Rounds expressed support for Wray, who was nominated by Trump in his first term in 2017.",
      "\"I think the president picked a very good man to be the director of the FBI when he did that in his first term,\" Rounds said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats were highly critical of the pick. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said on NBC that he will vote no, expressing concern that Patel \"is going to only care about protecting Republicans.\" And Murphy pledged to help his colleagues and the American public \"understand what's happening here.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump told the American public during the campaign that he was going to turn the Department of Justice into a political operation, an arm of the White House, to destroy his political opponents,\" Murphy said. \"Kash Patel's only qualification is because he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should serve to punish, lock up, and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents. And so the cost to the American public is pretty simple\"",
      "In recent weeks, Trump's most controversial selections for top posts in his administration have faced intense scrutiny as they prepare for the Senate confirmation process. And one pick, former Rep. Matt Gaetz, already withdrew his name from consideration facing headwinds in the Senate.",
      "Sen. Dick Durbin, the current majority whip in the upper chamber, urged his Senate colleagues in a statement to reject Trump's pick of Patel, noting that \"we already have a FBI director\" and accusing the president-elect of wanting to \"replace his own appointee with an unqualified loyalist.\"",
      "\"The Senate should reject this unprecedented effort to weaponize the FBI for the campaign of retribution that Donald Trump has promised,\" Durbin said.",

      "His post went on to describe Boulos as \"a dealmaker, and an unwavering supporter of PEACE in the Middle East,\" who \"will be a strong advocate for the United States, and its interests.\"",
      "The selection comes as Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance continue their transition into the White House ahead of January's inauguration. Boulos will likely play a role in how Trump approaches Israel's ongoing war with Hamas in Gaza, which has triggered conflicts with Lebanon and Iran while threatening to spread more widely throughout the region. The Biden White House announced last week that it had helped broker a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Iran-backed group Hezbollah in Lebanon, although both Israel and Hezbollah have accused the other of violating the agreement. Negotiations for a similar deal with Hamas have long been stalled.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "summary": "Canada's Competition Bureau says that an investigation found the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
    "story": [
      "Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday it is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and wants the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty.",
      "The Competition Bureau said that such action is necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company \"unlawfully\" tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position.",
      "The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about non-compliance with the Competition Act.",
      "The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges.",
      "This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues.",
      "\"Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors, and distorting the competitive process,\" Matthew Boswell, Commissioner of Competition, said in a statement.",
      "Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector.",
      "Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint \"ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.\"",
      "The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation.",
      "U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade.",
      "The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that \"Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly.\" He outlined a timeline for a trial on proposed remedies next spring and plans to issue a decision by August 2025.",
      "Mehta also found that Google in 2021 Google paid about $26 billion to Apple and other partners to ensure its search engine would be the default one on internet browsers.",
      "His ruling stemmed from a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit first filed against Google in October 2020 during the first Trump administration.",
      "Google has already said it plans to appeal Mehta's ruling, but the tech giant must wait until he finalizes a remedy before doing so. The appeals process could take as long as five years, predicts George Hay, a law professor at Cornell University who was the chief economist for the Justice Department's antitrust division for most of the 1970s.",

    "title": "Australian parliament approves law to ban under-16s from social media",
    "published": "Thu, 28 Nov 2024 08:03:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Australia's full legislature has now passed a bill that will soon ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's Senate passed legislation Wednesday that, once signed by the country's leader who has strongly endorsed it,\u00a0will ban children under the age of 16 from using most social media platforms. The new law will give Australia the tightest restrictions of any democracy in the world on children's use of hugely popular social media apps.",
      "The Senate passed the bill by 34 votes to 19 on Thursday, a day after Australia's House of Representatives\u00a0passed the same bill by a sweeping margin of 102 votes to 13.",
      "Australia's major parties in the House all supported the bill, which will see social media companies such as TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for failing to prevent people under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms.",
      "Tech giant Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, has called for the bill to be delayed. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0posted online Tuesday, Meta said it was \"concerned the government is rushing this legislation without adequate consultation or evidence and there are still many unknowns with respect to its implementation.\"",
      "\"The Government's approach will likely require each app provider to collect personal identification or biometric data from all Australians in order to prevent under 16s from accessing their services, an inefficient and burdensome process for everyone,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "Meta also pointed to a policy it introduced earlier this year on its Instagram platform, Instagram teen accounts, which limits who can contact teenagers via their accounts and attempts to moderate the content that young users see.",
      "In a post shared last week on the X platform that he owns, tech billionaire Elon Musk also condemned the Australian bill and said it seemed to him \"like a backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians.\"",
      "Other independent bodies and non-profit organizations have also taken aim at the bill, voicing concern that young people's human rights could be restricted by it.",
      "The CEO of the Save the Children charity Mat Tinkler said in a statement\u00a0earlier this month that while he welcomes government efforts to protect children from harm online, the solution should be regulating social media companies, rather than introducing a blanket ban.",
      "\"We are asking the government to reconsider this legislative approach and instead use the momentum of this moment to hold the social media giants to account, to demand that they embed safety into their platforms rather than adding it as an afterthought, and to work closely with experts and children and young people themselves to make online spaces safer, as opposed to off-limits,\" Tinkler said.",
      "The Australian Human Rights Commission, an independent government body, expressed its own \"serious reservations\" over the proposed law in an analysis published last week.",
      "\"There are less restrictive alternatives available that could achieve the aim of protecting children and young people from online harms, but without having such a significant negative impact on other human rights. One example of an alternative response would be to place a legal duty of care on social media companies,\" the analysis said. \"We also need to help children and young people to better navigate online spaces by ensuring the national curriculum includes a specific focus on teaching digital literacy and online safety.\"",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese rejected criticism of the proposed law as he\u00a0addressed the parliament\u00a0Monday.",
      "\"There are common sense exemptions. We want to make sure that young people can continue to access health and education related services \u2014 Headspace, YouTube, Google Classroom \u2014 as well as messaging services and online games,\" he said.",
      "The Australian leader added that there would be \"very strong and strict privacy requirements to protect people's personal information, including an obligation to destroy information provided once age has been verified.\"",
      "Despite the criticism, the legislation remains popular among Australians, according to recent polling data.",
      "A YouGov survey released Tuesday showed 77% of Australians back the ban on under-16s, and 87% of said they supported the introduction of stronger penalties for social media companies that fail to comply with regulations.",

      "Trump has a combined 65 million followers on Facebook and Instagram.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president.",
      "Zuckerberg has since taken a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump's response to his first assassination attempt, calling it \"badass.\" Zuckerberg also complained that senior Biden administration officials pressured Facebook to \"censor\" some COVID-19 content during the pandemic.",
      "Still, Trump in recent months had continued to attack Zuckerberg publicly. In July, he posted a message on his own social network Truth Social threatening to send election fraudsters to prison in part by citing a nickname he used for the Meta CEO. \"ZUCKERBUCKS, be careful!\" Trump wrote.",
      "The Thanksgiving eve visit also comes as tech mogul Elon Musk has become more influential in Trump's Make America Great Again movement, contributing an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Trump.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday is weighing for the first time whether states can restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, stepping into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth.",
      "Roughly half of the states have enacted laws that prohibit puberty blockers or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18, and the dispute brought by the Biden administration, three families and a doctor tests whether states cross a constitutional line when regulating medical care that transgender adolescents argue is crucial to their well-being.",
      "Oral arguments in the case, known as U.S. v. Skrmetti, are streaming live in the player above.",
      "The case involves a Tennessee law known as SB1 that was\u00a0adopted in March 2023. It bars health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in prohibiting treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Puberty blockers and hormones are allowed when prescribed to treat a congenital defect, precocious puberty or other disease. The law went into effect on July 1, 2023, but transgender adolescents who started treatment before then had until March 31 to phase out their medication.",
      "Tennessee's law is part of a wave of measures passed by GOP-led states in recent years prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. President-elect Donald Trump has also pledged to restrict medical treatments for transgender adolescents and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, another area where states have enacted bans.",
      "U.S. v. Skrmetti",
      "State lawmakers have argued that they are trying to protect young people from \"the life-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition interventions,\" and have said the treatments are \"risky\" and \"unproven.\" The law, Tennessee officials told the Supreme Court in filings, sets age- and use-based limits on medical care, and is a routine exercise of the state's authority to regulate medicine.",
      "\"The government second-guesses elected lawmakers' judgment and asks this court to do the same,\" Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti argued in a filing with the high court. \"But this court should not snuff out legislative developments in an evolving area by enshrining the government's skewed science into the Constitution.\"",
      "But the Biden administration, along with the three Tennessee families and Memphis doctor, assert the state's ban draws sex-based lines and discriminates based on transgender status, a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "\"An adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can. And vice versa, an adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in a brief. \"That is sex discrimination.\"",
      "Shortly before Tennessee's law took effect, the families with transgender children and Dr. Susan Lacy, who provided gender-affirming care to patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria, challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status and is likely unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the \"benefits of the medical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established,\" and said the law bars treatments for \"a tiny fraction of minors, while leaving them available to all other minors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\"",
      "A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued. The measure, the court found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "Both the Biden administration and the families, represented by the ACLU, separately asked the Supreme Court to review the 6th Circuit's decision. The high court in June agreed to do so, but took up only the Biden administration's appeal, which asked the justices to decide whether Tennessee's law violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents had argued the law infringed on their due process right to make decisions about their children's medical care, but the justices are not considering that question.",
      "Among the issues the Biden administration has asked the Supreme Court to consider is whether the 6th Circuit applied the wrong standard when evaluating the constitutionality of Tennessee's law. The lower court held that the ban is subject to rational-basis review, the most deferential of the three tiers of scrutiny. But Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar has argued the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with the Biden administration, it could send the case back to the lower court to apply that more demanding standard, as Prelogar is asking it to do.",
      "Prelogar is set to argue on behalf of the U.S. on Wednesday, and she will share time with Chase Strangio of the ACLU, who will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court. Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice will present the state's case to the justices.",
      "The case is the most significant involving transgender rights that the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, has heard in years. In 2020, the high court divided 6-3 in finding that Title VII's protections from discrimination in the workplace extend to gay and transgender employees. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal members joined.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in this case is expected by the end of June.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 09:09:17 -0500",
    "summary": "These high-powered weapons are only meant for police. How are they ending up in criminals' hands?",
    "story": [
      "Adair, Iowa, had a population of 794. So, it seemed suspicious when its three-person police department asked regulators to buy 90 machine guns, including an M134 Gatling-style minigun capable of shooting up to 6,000 rounds of ammunition every minute.",
      "Federal agents later discovered Adair's police chief, Bradley Wendt, was using his position to acquire weapons and sell them for personal profit. A jury convicted Wendt earlier this year of conspiracy to defraud the United States, lying to federal law enforcement and illegal possession of a machine gun. Wendt is unapologetic and has appealed his conviction.",
      "\"If I'm guilty of this, every cop in the nation's going to jail,\" Wendt told CBS News just days before a federal judge sentenced him to a 5-year prison term. Wendt's crimes appear to be part of a nationwide pattern.",
      "A CBS News investigation found dozens of law enforcement leaders \u2014 sheriffs, captains, lieutenants, chiefs of police \u2014 buying and illegally selling firearms, even weapons of war, across 23 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., from the Deep South to the Midwest, Northeast and California coast.",
      "A nationwide review of government audits and court records over the last 20 years uncovered at least 50 cases of police illegally selling their weapons online, through dealers, out of their homes or the back of their cars. In many cases, the weapons were sold to gun enthusiasts, often at steep markups as high as 10 times what they were bought for.",
      "In several cases, the guns wound up in the hands of violent felons and were used to commit crimes including drug trafficking, international arms dealing and, in one case, the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy attending a high school football game.",
      "In 2011, federal agents busted a smuggling ring out of New Mexico involving a police chief, mayor and village trustee who delivered automatic firepower and tactical gear to a Mexican cartel.",
      "A decade later, prosecutors uncovered a multistate conspiracy linking a sanctioned Russian arms dealer with three police chiefs, one sheriff and a Delta Force veteran who sold machine guns directly to a criminal trafficker. All of them pleaded guilty. An additional alleged co-conspirator, who worked as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, denied wrongdoing and his case is proceeding to trial.",
      "Nearly 26,000 guns were traced from American crime scenes back to a government agency, law enforcement or the military between 2017 and 2021, the most recently available data, according to a report by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. It isn't known how many of those were lost, stolen or sold. However, when government auditors investigated firearms that law enforcement agencies reported missing over a 15-year period, the General Services Administration Inspector General found that more than two-thirds had not gone missing at all but, rather, were inappropriately sold or traded \u2014including Uzis and grenade launchers that were never recovered.",
      "Meanwhile, a separate Government Accountability Office audit in 2018 found $100 million worth of guns and ammunition bought by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was unaccounted for. In response, ICE said that it improved how it would keep track of its inventory going forward; there was no follow-up about the weapons that were already missing. ICE did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Of the 58 cases CBS News identified where law enforcement officers were criminally charged with illegally selling their weapons, 56 of them either admitted guilt or were convicted; two have denied wrongdoing in ongoing cases.",
      "Those cases are just the tip of the iceberg, according to interviews with half a dozen former Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents who worked directly on these investigations. Several career agents shared anecdotes about letting police departments off with warnings after repeatedly finding their service weapons in the hands of private citizens. The agents explained that prosecutors have been generally reluctant to charge these cases, and the bureau stated that \"it is our goal to educate, not investigate,\" according to a 2017 law enforcement memo obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"We're not looking to prosecute fellow law enforcement officers,\" said Eric Harden, former special agent in charge of the ATF's Los Angeles field division.",
      "Harden authored the 2017 memo, which flagged a \"growing trend\" of \"officers purchasing and then selling [restricted] firearms...for profit.\" The memo warned that anyone doing this was functionally acting as a straw purchaser in violation of at least two federal laws.",
      "Harden told CBS News that if officers persisted after being warned, or if their weapons were traced to a crime, they should be held accountable. \"If we don't do this, then it'll be turning a blind eye and saying officers are above the law.\"",
      "Harden wrote the memo after his intelligence unit traced an outlawed pistol seized in a narcotics bust to a recent purchase by a beat cop in Pasadena, California. Now retired, Harden still remembers that officer crying on his shoulder when federal agents showed up to arrest him for illegally selling more than 100 weapons out of his home. The officer argued at the time that he didn't know he was breaking the law, but he later pleaded guilty. He served less than a year in federal prison and paid a $10,000 fine but was allowed to keep his Porsche and Alfa Romeo.",
      "On the other side of LA County, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer, with secret-level security clearance, was operating an even more egregious gun-running scheme that went on for 20 years. He too eventually pleaded guilty, in 2019, after an undercover agent busted him selling weapons out of the trunk of his car. His stockpile at the time totaled more than 250 firearms, including 41 machine guns and two short-barreled rifles.",
      "The officer \"betrayed his oath to uphold the laws of the United States solely to put more money in his pocket,\" the U.S. Attorney said in announcing the news of the officer's prison sentence.",
      "Several cases involved sheriffs and police leadership who used their positions in law enforcement to gain access to military-grade machine guns, short-barreled rifles and explosive devices like grenades, and then sold them in violation of federal law.",
      "Although the Second Amendment guarantees the right to bear arms, there are limits to the kinds of weapons people are allowed to possess. Post-1986, these weapons \u2014 known to the ATF as Class 3/Title II and to the gun industry as \"posties\"\u2014 have been restricted for official government use because of their deadly firepower. Many of them are battlefield weapons used by U.S. and NATO forces in conflict zones. Some ammunition can take out a helicopter or blow straight through an armored tank followed by a concrete building, out the other side, then explode, hitting targets 18 football fields away. These guns can spew hundreds of rounds each minute, faster than the speed of sound.",
      "\"Congress knew almost 100 years ago, in the days of Al Capone, that fully automatic weapons were unusually dangerous,\" ATF Director Steven Dettelbach said a public address on Feb. 28, 2023. \"They have no place in our communities.\"",
      "The government loophole, however, has been exploited by opportunists who recruit law enforcement conspirators to help them bypass the American machine gun prohibition, according to law enforcement records and court filings obtained by CBS News that include text messages, videos and wiretapped audio conversations between people who were either convicted of or admitted participation in these schemes.",
      "CBS News found a trail of activity in social media videos and online web forums frequented by firearm aficionados discussing how to entice law enforcement allies into this illicit trade, which can be highly lucrative. Amid a series of online conversations reviewed by CBS News, one poster suggested that after law enforcement acquired a $10,000 machine gun through the federal approval process, it could be worth $75,000 because it would be free of red tape. Wendt, the Iowa police chief, for example, at times earned more than a 90% profit margin, according to court records.",
      "\"Here is a breakdown of who signs for me,\" advised another online user, identifying one police chief, one sheriff, one SWAT officer and one deputy sheriff with whom he said he attended high school.",
      "For police departments to get ahold of such high-powered weaponry, each one needs permission from the ATF. Even though it has been the law for more than three decades, the ATF only started vetting every machine gun application for the first time in January 2023 to confirm that a legitimate government agency was making the request.",
      "According to interviews with half a dozen longtime ATF officials who worked directly on these cases, the bureau typically does not assess the appropriateness of the weapons for a department or track where they end up.",
      "\"There's no audits,\" said former Supervisory Special Agent Tim Graden, who worked at the ATF for more than two decades before retiring in 2022. \"There was no second-guessing whatsoever. They weren't really \u2014 I don't want to use the word concerned, but I can't think of a better one.\"",
      "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives declined requests to comment.",
      "It's unclear how pervasive this is nationwide, but in Iowa alone over the past five years, the ATF did not deny a single law enforcement request for machine guns \"based on suitability (or lack thereof),\" according to court filings. By 2023, there were more than 1,200 machine guns registered to law enforcement across the state.",
      "To find out how that compares to other places, CBS News filed a series of Freedom of Information Act requests with the ATF for details about the high-powered arsenal it's granted to public law enforcement over the past decade. However, the bureau denied those requests, stating that it considers that private tax information exempt from public disclosure. Last week, CBS News filed a lawsuit for the information.",
      "The proliferation of this high-powered weaponry is likely to become increasingly more relevant when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. During his first administration, Trump revoked an Obama-era executive order restricting the transfer of military equipment from the Defense Department to law enforcement nationwide. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Mr. Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20.",

      "Calling it \"the honor of a lifetime\" to have been nominated, Chronister said in a social media post on X, \"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration. There is more work to be done for the citizens of Hillsborough County and a lot of initiatives I am committed to fulfilling.\"",

    "summary": "Donald Trump's attorneys mentioned Hunter Biden in a filing arguing the New York criminal case against the president-elect should be dismissed.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's lawyers pointed to an unlikely person in demanding a judge dismiss the president-elect's New York criminal case: Hunter Biden.",
      "Trump's attorneys said in a court filing made public Tuesday that President Joe Biden's controversial pardon of his son echoed Trump's complaints about the prosecution.",
      "\"Yesterday, in issuing a 10-year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'\" they wrote, before claiming Trump was treated similarly.",
      "In the filing, which was submitted Monday night, they formally demanded a New York judge throw out the president-elect's criminal case and nullify a unanimous jury's conclusion that Trump committed dozens of felonies.",
      "Their argument struck at the quality of the case against Trump, but centers largely on a wholly unique argument in the history of America's legal system. Trump's lawyers said his conviction in state court should not stand because he was elected president after his conviction.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have vowed to oppose the dismissal motion, and have been given a one-week deadline to file their response. They pursued the case amid a torrent of public threats of retribution by Trump's allies, and anonymous threats of violence by his supporters.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued in their filing that the Constitution requires dismissal of the case, even though it's already progressed though trial, because ongoing proceedings threaten to take Trump's attention from the presidency.",
      "\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" wrote his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, each of whom are slated to take on high-level positions at the Justice Department after Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Trump's sentencing was recently postponed for a third time. After he was convicted in May, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for July 11. In the interim, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling concluding that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "The first sentencing postponement came because Trump's attorneys wanted to file a motion to dismiss based on that Supreme Court ruling. Merchan has yet to rule on that motion.",
      "They then asked for and were granted a postponement of the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, arguing that it was too close to the election.",
      "After Trump won the presidency on Nov. 5, his attorneys quickly indicated they'd make Monday's request. In Trump's filing, his attorneys refer to his election victory as \"overwhelming.\"",
      "Bragg's office has floated postponing sentencing and other proceedings until after Trump's term in office, which ends in 2029.",
      "\"Consideration must be given to various non-dismissal options that may address any concerns raised by the pendency of a post-trial criminal proceeding during the presidency, such as deferral of all remaining criminal proceedings until after the end of defendant's upcoming presidential term,\" they wrote in a Nov. 19 letter to Merchan.",
      "The Manhattan case against Trump set a series of unprecedented firsts. He was the first person in American history to be elected president after being convicted of crimes. When the anonymous jury concluded in May he was guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records, he became the first former president ever convicted of crimes. The case against Trump began when a grand jury in March 2023 made him the first former president ever indicted.",
      "The case revolved around a coverup of a \"hush money\" payment to an adult film star before his first election to office in 2016. While in office, Trump authorized a scheme to conceal reimbursements to a lawyer who made the payment to the actress just days before Trump's first election.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",
      "CDC's data on emergency room visits from the bacteria Mycoplasma pneumoniae, sometimes called \"walking pneumonia,\" have increased in recent weeks especially in babies.",
      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

      "The episode, from the first season of the American animated series, shows father figure Peter Griffin standing next to the \"Tank Man\" in a recreation of an infamous photograph depicting a lone resistor to China's military forces as they moved in to disperse a days-long pro-democracy protest. As the tanks approach, the cartoon dad says: \"Ah screw this, I just came over to buy some fireworks,\" before fleeing.",

Indonesia has also had confrontations with the Chinese coast guard, which backs Beijing's fishing fleets.",
      "The long-simmering territorial disputes between China and America's allies and other Asian nations are a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. lays no claims in the South China Sea, which is a key global shipping route, but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight, and the peaceful resolution of the conflicts, are among its core national interests.",

    "summary": "South Korea is reeling over a shock martial law declaration by President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose short-lived gamble will have major implications.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul\u00a0\u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol seemed to treat a declaration of martial law as if it were a light switch, flipping it on at 11 p.m. Tuesday night, only to be unanimously rebuked in an emergency session of the country's parliament just two hours later. It took him about three hours from that point to accept defeat and announce that he was lifting the martial law order.",
      "The martial law declaration and revocation within six hours was the fiercest whiplash between military control and democracy that South Korea has endured since it became a democracy in 1987. It appears highly likely to bring a swift end to Yoon's two-year tenure as the country's elected leader.",
      "The president's gamble seemed rooted primarily in his own domestic political isolation and, while short-lived, it was sure to have major ramifications both for Yoon as a politician, and for South Korea as a nation.",
      "Below is a look at what Yoon did, why he did it, and what it could mean for one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and biggest economies.",
      "What is martial law?",
      "A declaration of martial law is typically used by political or military leaders in a country facing a purported immediate threat to stability or security. It is ostensibly intended to protect the rule of law and citizens by putting military forces in immediate control of a country, suspending the authority of a civilian government and legal system.",
      "Yoon's order immediately put South Korea's military in charge of security across the country, froze virtually all existing laws and granted the forces extraordinary powers to detain people without charge and to censor the media.",
      "There was no indication that South Korean troops took advantage of the powers granted to them during the six hours of martial law on Tuesday evening, though there were tense scuffles as forces blocked access to the parliament building and throngs of angry citizens turned up to protest Yoon's sudden move.",
      "Why did South Korea's president impose martial law?",
      "\"I declared martial law at 11:00 last night with a firm will to save the country against anti-state forces that are trying to paralyze the essential functions of the state and destroy the constitutional order of liberal democracy,\" Yoon told his nation in a televised address, claiming the declaration would protect south Korea from a \"threat of the North Korean communist forces.\"",
      "But he never identified any specific military movements by the North, and his shock move appeared to have been directed more at what he called the \"legislative dictatorship\" of his own country's opposition Democratic Party.",
      "Yoon has seen his approval rating fall for several months, and with the opposition in control of the parliament for the last two years, he's struggled to move forward any of his political objectives. He's also faced criticism for dismissing multiple calls for independent investigations into financial scandals involving himself and his wife.",
      "He complained Tuesday that the opposition had effectively left him unable to govern, including by proposing nearly two dozen impeachment motions against his conservative government and slashing his national budget by at least $700 billion dollars.",
      "But despite Yoon's political isolation and falling support among voters, few in the country anticipated a counterattack as dramatic as the declaration of martial law.",
      "What will the martial law declaration mean for South Korea?",
      "In an early indication of the huge impact of Yoon's move, South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun offered his resignation Wednesday, expressing regret \"for causing confusion and concern to the public regarding martial law.\"",
      "In a statement from his office, Kim said he took \"full responsibility for all matters related to martial law,\" excusing rank and file troops who he said had merely \"performed their duties\" under his orders.",
      "\"Martial law has been lifted and the public is returning to their daily lives, but the domestic political and security situations are not easy,\" Kim said in the statement, adding that the ministry would \"make every effort to manage current issues stably while ensuring that there are no disruptions in national defense operations.\"",
      "The White House, in a statement late Tuesday in Washington, expressed relief that Yoon had rescinded his martial law declaration.",
      "\"Democracy is at the foundation of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and we will continue to monitor the situation,\" an administration spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by the initials of its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "\"Whichever way this shakes out, this is a major setback for what has been seen as a democratic stronghold in the Asia Pacific for the last 44 years,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former senior Homeland Security official.",
      "\"The overall perception of South Korea as a stable democracy has been tarnished at a time when an aggressive China and overall retrenchment from democracy globally are big concerns for U.S. national security,\" said Vinograd, who's now the geopolitical lead at the Brunswick Group think tank in Washington.",
      "Washington has a deeply vested interest in stability in South Korea. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, largely to deter any aggression by nuclear-armed North Korea, but also as a deterrent against an increasingly assertive China.",
      "South Korea's capital Seoul lies just 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone \u2014 the no-man's land created to separate the North and South when an armistice ended combat in the Korean War in 1953. The two countries technically remain at war as there was never a formal treaty, and tension between the Koreas has escalated in recent years, including under Yoon, who's taken a harder line on the North than his predecessor.",
      "\"The Biden administration is going to be faced with some very difficult decisions about what to say and do,\" said Vinograd. \"South Korea is one of our closest allies, but this move seems to have come as a surprise to the White House.\"",
      "\"South Korea is a strong balancing factor against North Korea and against communist China,\" Vinograd said, adding that both the North and Moscow \"are likely cheering the democratic upheaval in South Korea.\"",
      "\"They see any signs of instability in South Korea as something that they can take advantage of,\" she said. \"Without a vibrant democracy in South Korea, forces within China, within North Korea, will likely feel emboldened, and overall, democratic tendencies in the Asia Pacific will likely take a hit as well.\"",
      "Yoon faces calls to resign, threat of impeachment",
      "Yoon looked increasingly likely to lose his job Wednesday after his seemingly dramatic miscalculation of political support.",
      "The Democratic Party called quickly for Yoon to step down or face impeachment, and along with five smaller opposition parties, it submitted a bill in parliament Wednesday to impeach the president, with voting expected on the measure Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down,\" senior Democratic Party lawmaker Park Chan-dae said in a statement, urging Yoon not to wait to be forced out.",
      "South Korea's parliament, the National Assembly, can impeach the president if over two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favor of the move. If it happens and he doesn't resign first, South Korea's constitutional court will then hold a trial to either confirm or deny the impeachment motion. Six of the nine justices on the court must back an impeachment for it to go ahead.",
      "Yoon's PPP holds 108 seats in the 300-member legislature, but even his own party appeared unlikely to back the embattled president too robustly. Its leader called Wednesday for Yoon's entire cabinet to resign, and the unanimous vote overruling his martial law declaration was a clear indication of the level of opposition to his conduct.",
      "South Korean stocks tumble after martial law declaration",
      "The streets of Seoul appeared largely normal Wednesday despite the overnight tumult. While police were out in force amid renewed protests against Yoon around the parliament, the usual morning rush hour traffic choked roads and railways.",
      "More protests were expected, however, and South Korea's biggest labor union coaltion, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, declared a nationwide strike and said it would hold a rally in the capital until Yoon left office.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Seoul urged American nationals in the city to avoid areas where protests were taking place, and some of the country's biggest employers, including the LG Electronics brand, urged employees to work from home.",
      "The unrest also took a toll on Asian stocks, with South Korean shares falling about 1.4% Wednesday and the country's currency, the won, stable but still close to a two-year low against the dollar.",
      "South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and national bank governor Rhee Chang-yong gathered their deputies overnight for emergency meetings, and the finance ministry promised to take whatever measures were necessary to prop up falling share prices, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Reuters said canned goods and staples such as instant noodles and bottled water flew off store shelves overnight as South Koreans feared a possible lingering political crisis.",
      "\"South Korea is no stranger to martial law,\" Vinograd told CBS News, noting that the measure had been declared at least 15 times by various authoritarian regimes since the country's founding in 1948.",
      "\"I'm deeply disturbed by this kind of situation,\" Seoul resident Kim Byeong-In, 39, told Reuters overnight, \"and I'm very concerned about the future of the country.\"",

      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",

      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

    "story": [
      "Israel unleashed its largest wave of airstrikes across Lebanon since agreeing to a ceasefire with Hezbollah last week, killing at least 11 people on Monday after the Lebanese militant group fired a volley of projectiles as a warning over what it said were Israeli truce violations.",
      "The projectiles were apparently the first time that Hezbollah took aim at Israeli forces after the 60-day ceasefire went into effect last Wednesday. The increasingly fragile truce aimed to end more than a year of war between Hezbollah and Israel \u2014 part of a wider regional conflict sparked by the devastating Israel-Hamas war in Gaza.",
      "In a possible sign of the ceasefire's frailty \u2014 and a clear warning of the implications for Lebanon of it failing \u2014 Israeli Defense Minister Israeli Katz was cited by the country's Army Radio network on Tuesday as warning that if the truce \"collapses, we will act strongly and stop separating Hezbollah from the state of Lebanon.\"",
      "Airstrikes, missile launches test shaky Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire",
      "Lebanon's Health Ministry said an Israeli airstrike on the southern village of Haris killed five people and wounded two while another airstrike on the village of Tallousa killed four and also wounded two.",
      "Israel's military carried out a string of airstrikes late Monday against what it said were Hezbollah fighters, infrastructure and rocket launchers across Lebanon. The strikes were a response to Hezbollah firing two projectiles toward Mount Dov \u2014 a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \"defensive and warning response\" after what it called \"repeated violations\" of the ceasefire deal by Israel. It said complaints to mediators tasked with monitoring the ceasefire \"were futile in stopping these violations.\"",
      "Before the Hezbollah projectiles, Israel carried out at least four airstrikes and an artillery barrage in southern Lebanon, including a drone strike that killed a person on a motorcycle, according to Lebanese state media. Another strike killed a corporal in the Lebanese security services.",
      "Israel has said its strikes are in response to unspecified Hezbollah violations, and that under the ceasefire deal it reserves the right to retaliate.",
      "Lebanon's parliament speaker, Nabih Berri, accused Israel of violating the truce more than 50 times in recent days by launching airstrikes, demolishing homes near the border and violating Lebanon's airspace.",
      "Officials in the U.S. \u2014 which along with France helped broker the truce and heads a commission meant to monitor adherence to the deal \u2014 played down the significance of Israeli strikes. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said, \"Largely speaking, the ceasefire is holding.\"",
      "\"We've gone from dozens of strikes down to one a day maybe two a day,\" Kirby told reporters, referring to Israeli strikes. \"We're going to keep trying and see what we can do to get it down to zero.\"",
      "Under the deal, Iran-backed Hezbollah has 60 days to withdraw its fighters and infrastructure from southern Lebanon. During that time, Israeli troops are also to withdraw to their side of the border.",
      "The ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel did nothing to quell the ongoing bloodshed in Gaza, where Israel's military offensive against the other Iran-backed group Hamas has killed more than 44,000 people, according to health officials in the Palestinian enclave that has been ruled by Hamas for almost 20 years.",

      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump called for Palestinian militants to free all of the roughly 100 Israeli hostages still held inside Gaza, about two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive.",

November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures. But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid.",

      "\"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",
      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\" Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Paris has been preparing for the reopening of the cathedral, which will be marked by days of celebration starting on Saturday. Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, along with Macron, will preside over Saturday's service, which will be broadcast on French television. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are expected to participate in the celebration, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Diocese of Paris, and one priest from each of the seven Eastern Catholic Churches, accompanied by Catholics from these communities, according to Notre Dame's website.",

The pot itself was likely made at a pottery kiln in the region, the museum said.

      "London \u2014\u00a0A Michelin-starred chef in England called Monday on the thieves who stole his work van, along with about $32,000 worth of meat pies inside it, to embrace the holiday spirit and hand over the looted goods to help feed people in need. Tommy Banks, who owns restaurants in northeast England, posted a video on Instagram telling followers about the theft of his van and the 2,500 pies, and appealing to those responsible to \"do the right thing.\"",
      "The chef said the refrigerated van was loaded with the food and left to charge overnight. But when a colleague returned in the morning to deliver the pies, it was nowhere to be found.",
      "In a statement, the North Yorkshire Police said Wednesday that the stolen van was found abandoned with fake license plates more than 30 miles away from where it was taken, and an investigation into the theft was ongoing. It wasn't immediately clear if all the pies were still in the van.",
      "A post shared by Tommy Banks (@tommybanks)",
      "\"I know you're a criminal,\" Banks said in his video appeal, \"but maybe just do something nice because it's Christmas and maybe we could feed a few thousand people with these pies that you stole,\" urging the perpetrators to leave the pies at a community center or some other facility from which they could be distributed.",
      "In a follow-up post, he warned that \"time was running out for these pie hostages,\" alluding to the shelf-life of the traditional English dish. The savory goods stolen with the van included steak and ale, and turkey and butternut squash pies, all of which were headed for a pop-up pie stall at the nearby York Christmas Market.",
      "Chef Banks owns two restaurants, a pub and a premium catering service around the ancient city of York. He said the pilfered pies were worth about $32,000.",
      "Banks ended his social media post by saying he hoped the thieves \"don't get any presents this Christmas.\"",
      "The pie heist wasn't the first food-related robbery in England this autumn.",
      "In October, $390,000 worth of cheddar cheese was stolen from Neal's Yard Dairy in London. The retailer said a con artist posing as a wholesale distributor stole nearly 49,000 pounds of cheese. Detectives at Scotland Yard and international authorities were still searching for the culprits as of this week.",

    "story": [
      "A Vietnamese court upheld the death penalty Tuesday for a property tycoon in a multibillion-dollar fraud case \u2014 but said her life could still be spared if she paid back three quarters of the assets she embezzled.",
      "Property developer\u00a0Truong My Lan, 68, was convicted this year of swindling money from Saigon Commercial Bank (SCB) \u2014 which prosecutors said she controlled \u2014 and sentenced to death for fraud totaling $27 billion.",
      "She appealed the verdict in a month-long trial, but on Tuesday the court in Ho Chi Minh City determined that there was \"no basis\" to reduce her sentence.",
      "However, there is still a chance for Lan to escape the death penalty.",
      "The court said Tuesday that if she returns three-quarters of the stolen assets, her sentence could be reduced to life imprisonment.",
      "That means she could still avoid execution if she returns $9 billion, or three-quarters of the $12 billion she embezzled, the BBC reports. It's not her final appeal and she can still petition the president for amnesty.",
      "\"The total value of her holdings actually exceeds the required compensation amount,\" lawyer Nguyen Huy Thiep told the BBC before her appeal was rejected. \"However, these require time and effort to sell, as many of the assets are real estate and take time to liquidate. Truong My Lan hopes the court can create the most favorable conditions for her to continue making compensation.\"",
      "She is now essentially in a race to raise the funds she needs before her execution, the BBC reports.",
      "Her husband Eric Chu Nap Kee, a Hong Kong billionaire, had his sentence reduced from nine years in prison to seven.",
      "Tens of thousands of people who invested their savings in SCB lost money, shocking the communist nation and prompting rare protests from the victims.",
      "Lan, who founded real estate development group Van Thinh Phat, earlier told the court that \"the quickest way\" to repay the stolen funds would be \"to liquidate SCB, and sell our assets to repay SBV (State Bank of Vietnam) and the people\".",
      "During her trial, Lan was sometimes defiant, but in the recent hearings for her appeal against the sentence she was more contrite, the BBC reported. She said she was ashamed to have been such a drain on the state, and that her only thought was to pay back what she had taken.",
      "\"I feel pained due to the waste of national resources,\" Lan said last week, adding she felt \"very embarrassed to be charged with this crime.\"",
      "Her defense team had argued that she already paid back the money needed to be eligible for a sentence reduction.",
      "Lan has turned over more than 600 family properties to the court, it acknowledged \u2014 but it was unclear how much money they were worth.",
      "Lan's lawyer told AFP on Tuesday that in any case, it would likely be years before Lan faces execution, which is carried out by lethal injection in Vietnam.",
      "Lan owned just five percent of shares in SCB on paper, but at her trial, the court concluded that she effectively controlled more than 90 percent through family, friends and staff.",
      "In April, a former chief inspector of the State Bank was given life in prison for accepting a five-million-dollar bribe to overlook financial problems at SCB. The court upheld the sentence on Tuesday.",
      "The bank said in April that it pumped funds into SCB to stabilise it, without revealing how much.",
      "Among the assets that Lan and Van Thinh Phat own are a shopping mall, a harbour and luxurious housing complexes in business hub Ho Chi Minh City.",
      "During her first trial in April, Lan was found guilty of embezzling $12.5 billion, but prosecutors said the total damages caused by the scam amounted to $27 billion \u2014 equivalent to around six percent of the country's 2023 GDP. The figure dwarfs even the amount that FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder\u00a0Sam Bankman-Fried was convicted\u00a0of swindling his customers out of, estimated at around $10 billion.",
      "Lan and dozens of defendants, including senior central bank officials, were arrested as part of a national corruption crackdown dubbed the \"burning furnace\" that has swept up numerous officials and members of Vietnam's business elite.",
      "Aside from Lan, a total of 47 other defendants requested reduced sentences at the appeal.",
      "Last month, Lan was convicted of money laundering and jailed for life in a separate case.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

      "\"When used long-term, laxatives can cause significant harm to your digestive system and overall health,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"Add these things on a daily basis, and I promise this will help you gently get the bad stuff out and move you into a much healthier, stronger gut state,\" he said.",
      "1. Increase fiber intake",
      "Fiber is critical to digestive health, according to Gioffre.",
      "\"When we have more fiber-rich foods, it's like brushing the inner walls of our intestines \u2014 and that's going to help us remove the constipation and get to where we want to go,\" the doctor said.",
      "Constipation affects 42 million Americans each day.",
      "Some of his suggested fiber-rich foods are quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash.",

      "\"When you drink this on an empty stomach, it's going to go into all the little nooks and crannies of your gut \u2026 and it's going to help you start to detoxify and gently give you that \u2018internal shower\u2019 effect.\"",
      "2. Reduce inflammation",
      "\"At the end of the day, we don't die of old age \u2014 we die of inflammation,\" Gioffre cautioned.",

      "Suggestions for fiber-rich foods include quinoa, wild rice, sweet potatoes, root vegetables, and squashes like winter squash and spaghetti squash. (iStock)",
      "Some plant-based foods that lower inflammation include chia seeds, flax seeds, hemp seeds, avocado and coconut oil.",

      "\"Magnesium-rich powerhouses relax your intestinal muscles, soften stools and keep things moving, all while feeding your healthy gut bacteria.\" (iStock)",

      "\"It can also increase your happiness, improve your relationships and give you a boost in mental strength that you'll likely need during the day.\"",
      "2. Don\u2019t skip breakfast",
      "It might seem wise to forgo the meal leading up to Thanksgiving, with the idea of \"making room\" for the main food event, but experts say that\u2019s not a good idea.",
      "\"When you skip breakfast or lunch, you tend to be ravenous by the time you do eat, and that sets you up for overeating as you overindulge,\" Shelley Balls, a registered dietitian nutritionist at Consumer Health Digest based in Wyoming, told Fox News Digital.",

      "Instead, she recommends eating a balanced breakfast so you feel more satisfied throughout the day.",
      "\"When Thanksgiving dinner rolls around, you'll have more control of what and how much you choose to eat.\"",
      "3. Choose foods wisely",
      "Among the many options on the Thanksgiving table, some choices are better than others.",

      "\"Some patients have trouble digesting certain carbohydrates, which can lead to excessive bloating and gas, causing pain related to functional disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome,\" a doctor cautioned. (iStock)",

      "\"A slower pace of eating will help improve digestion and help you recognize comfortable fullness.\"",
      "Another reason to slow down is that the faster you eat (and the less you chew), the more stomach acids have to work to break down foods, which leads to gas, bloating and reflux, Schopis added.",
      "5. Drink water with dinner",
      "This tip comes from Christine Byrne, a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina.",
      "GIVING THANKS CAN MAKE YOU HAPPIER AND HEALTHIER, EXPERTS SAY",
      "\"Keeping alcohol to a minimum will help you feel much better while you eat and afterward,\" she told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Because alcohol is a toxin, your body (particularly your liver) prioritizes breaking it down and getting it out of your system,\" she went on. \"That means digesting other food gets put on hold while the alcohol is processed.\"",

      "\"Choose to speak about things you have in common and reminisce over good memories,\" Amodio recommended.",
      "Some other ideas include bringing old photo albums, playing board games and taking breaks throughout the day by stepping into another room as needed.",
      "7. Take guilt off the menu",
      "\"Remember that Thanksgiving is just one day and guilt is not a food group,\" said Elizabeth Harris, a registered dietitian in Maryland.",
      "\"Consider how you want to feel after your holiday meal and do your best to walk your choices backwards from there.\"",

      "And if you miss the mark, it\u2019s not the end of the world, she noted.",
      "\"You get another chance at your very next meal to practice making feel-good choices that better support your needs.\"",

      "The case, United States v. Skrmetti, centers on a Tennessee law that bans gender-transition treatments for adolescents in the state.

The petitioners were also joined by the Biden administration earlier this year under a federal law that allows the administration to intervene in certain cases certified by the attorney general to be of \"general public importance.\"",
      "The petitioners argue the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

But it is just one of at least 25 U.S. states that has banned gender transition care for transgender adolescents, making the case \u2014 and Wednesday's oral arguments \u2014 one of the most high-profile cases to be heard this session.",
      "The oral arguments have been anticipated for months. The controversial case comes at a time in Washington when Republicans will regain control of the White House and both chambers of Congress next month, giving them heavy influence and, some fear, more control over the federal judiciary.",

      "\"That,\" the federal government wrote, \"is sex discrimination.\"",

      "The state argued in a court filing that the law \"contains no sex classification\" warranting the heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. Rather, it said, it \"creates two groups: minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.\"",

      "The Supreme Court has determined three different levels of scrutiny that help determine whether a law is permissible under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution: Strict scrutiny, heightened scrutiny and rational basis. The highest level, strict scrutiny, requires a law be passed to serve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to minimize harm.",
      "The second level of scrutiny, or \"heightened scrutiny,\" requires the governmental body to prove its actions further an \"important government interest\" by using means \"substantially related to that interest.\"",
      "The lowest bar, rational basis, is the most deferential of the tests and requires the law only serve a legitimate interest with a \"rational connection\" to the means and goals of the statute.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court at sunset (Aaron Schwartz/SIPA USA)",
      "Overview of the arguments",
      "Wednesday's oral arguments will center on whether banning gender transition care for minors violates protections under the Equal Protection Clause, either via gender discrimination or discrimination against their transgender status.",
      "The petitioners in the case will argue that the Tennessee law discriminates against individuals and their right to receive the same medical treatments based on their sex. Under the law, the petitioners argued in their court filing, \"an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\"",
      "TRUMP'S AG PICK HAS \u2018HISTORY OF CONSENSUS BUILDING\u2019",
      "Separately, they will argue that discriminating against individuals based on their transgender status is also sufficient to trigger higher scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause, noting that transgender individuals \"satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-suspect class,\" including being subject to discrimination, representing a \"discrete and identifiable minority\" and other components outlined by the Supreme Court, thereby necessitating that heightened scrutiny be applied.",
      "The respondents will argue that Senate Bill 1, places age- and use-based restrictions on certain drugs and, therefore, is not an example of unconstitutional discrimination.",
      "Further, they will argue that the law easily passes even the test of heightened scrutiny. The state contends it has \"compelling interests\" to protect the health and safety of minors in the state and \"in protecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profession.\"",

      "He said the ban on most types of gender care for transgender minors would likely not survive the heightened scrutiny test under the Equal Protection Clause, since the same treatments were not banned for their non-transgender peers.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit later overturned the district court's decision and reinstated the full ban, using the lowest test of rational basis. The petitioners appealed that decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the case.",

      "Musk also weighed in, posting on X that \"the scale of spending on illegal immigration boggles the mind!\"",
      "The data referenced by DOGE is from a 2023 study by the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). FAIR\u2019s latest report, published in March 2023, estimated that the net cost of illegal immigration \u2013 including federal, state and local spending \u2013 was \"at least\" $150.7 billion, amounting to $1,156 per taxpayer. This was up by nearly $35 billion since 2017 when it was $116 billion.",
      "FAIR said it landed on this number by \"subtracting the tax revenue paid by illegal aliens \u2013 just under $32 billion \u2013 from the gross negative economic impact of illegal immigration, $182 billion.\" By its estimates, the federal government spent $66 billion while state and local expenditures amounted to well over $115 billion.",

You'll often find these apps on third-party app stores, shady websites, or through suspicious emails and texts. What you wouldn't expect is to encounter them on the Google Play Store if you're an Android user or the App Store if you're on iPhone.",
      "While Apple does a great job of keeping its app marketplace safe, Google doesn't quite measure up.",
      "A new report has revealed that over a dozen malicious apps containing SpyLoan malware have been available on the Play Store. These apps have been downloaded by 8 million Android users, putting them at risk of extortion, harassment and financial loss. Below are images of four of the SpyLoan apps found on Google Play.",

      "What is SpyLoan malware?",
      "SpyLoan is malware often hidden in apps that promise instant loans. These apps reel people in with offers of quick, hassle-free loans, boasting low rates and hardly any requirements. While they might look legit at first glance, their real goal is to gather as much personal info as they can.",
      "Once they have it, they use it to harass or pressure users into paying ridiculous interest rates. They also use shady tactics like countdown timers or \"limited-time\" offers to create a fake sense of urgency, pushing people to act fast without thinking it through. Instead of helping with finances, these apps trap users in a cycle of debt and invade their privacy.",
      "McAfee's mobile research team has\u00a0uncovered 15 apps on the Google Play Store packed with SpyLoan malware. These apps use the same code and systems, targeting users worldwide to steal data and send it to command-and-control (C2) servers. Many of them hide behind fake names and logos that mimic legitimate financial institutions, making them look trustworthy at first glance. You can find the names of these apps in the screenshot added below.",

      "We reached out to Google, and a rep confirmed that Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",

Victims are often coerced into repaying loans at sky-high interest rates, with some even being threatened for delays. In extreme cases, the app operators have harassed victims' families and sent death threats, using stolen personal photos as leverage.",

      "4 ways to protect yourself from SpyLoan malware",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the SpyLoan malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

However, if a new computer isn\u2019t in your budget right now, using a supported antivirus on your Windows 7 machine is a good step.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: If upgrading isn't possible immediately, install a strong, reputable, up-to-date antivirus software that's compatible with Windows 7. However, keep in mind that this is a temporary solution and doesn't address all the vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3) Consider a new computer: While it's understandable that you're on a fixed budget, investing in a new computer might be the most cost-effective solution in the long run.

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson reveals how WalkON enhances walking and jogging with sensors and artificial tendons.",
      "Imagine slipping on a pair of shorts that could make walking feel like a breeze, almost as if you've instantly shed 20 pounds. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

      "The WalkON system can benefit anyone seeking to increase their mobility; however, it shows particular promise for older adults who may experience declining physical capabilities. Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

The background checks alone revealed highly sensitive personal data, including full names, home addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, employment details, information about family members, social media accounts and criminal histories.",

They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",

Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence.

    "story": [
      "Scammers are preying on society's most vulnerable members.",
      "Scammers have various methods when it comes to getting their hands on your phone number. You might think, \"Well, what's the big deal? Isn't it easy to find someone's number these days, no matter what?\" Yes. And if you've already had your fair share of telemarketers call you, maybe you feel like you've got it under control.",
      "The problem is that scammers with the right knowledge and the wrong intentions can wreak havoc just by having your phone number in their possession.",
      "Once they do, they can use it to trick you in all sorts of ways.",
      "The good news is that by familiarizing yourself with their tactics, you can be one step closer to preventing yourself from falling victim to them. Here's what you need to know.",

      "Illustration of a scammer using SIM swapping\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9 ways you can get scammed if your phone number falls into the wrong hands",
      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "How to protect yourself from these scams",
      "To protect your phone number from falling into the hands of scammers, here\u2019s what you can do:",
      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information. Most social media platforms and online services offer privacy settings that allow you to control who can view your personal information. Make sure to review and adjust these settings regularly. Only share your phone number with trusted contacts.",
      "3. Consider using a secondary number for online registrations and transactions:\u00a0Services like Google Voice can provide you with a secondary number that you can use for online activities, keeping your primary number private.",
      "4. Monitor your accounts regularly for unusual activity: Check your bank accounts, email and other online accounts for any signs of unauthorized access or suspicious activity.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "6. Use two-factor authentication apps instead of SMS-based verification where possible:\u00a0Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an extra layer of security that is more difficult for scammers to bypass compared to SMS-based verification.",
      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses. See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "8. Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with the information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier has the latest on regulatory uncertainty amid AI development on 'Special Report.'",
      "An increasing number of companies are using artificial intelligence (AI) for everyday tasks.\u00a0Much of the technology is helping with productivity and keeping the public safer. However, some industries are pushing back against certain aspects of AI. And some industry leaders are working to balance the good and the bad.",
      "\"We are looking at critical infrastructure owners and operators, businesses from water and health care and transportation and communication, some of which are starting to integrate some of these AI capabilities,\" said U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. \"We want to make sure that they're integrating them in a way where they are not introducing a lot of new risk.\"",
      "US AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TESTS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A LOT OF POTENTIAL'",
      "Consulting firm Deloitte recently surveyed leaders of business organizations from around the world. The findings showed uncertainty over government regulations was a bigger issue than actually implementing AI technology. When asked about the top barrier to deploying AI tools, 36% ranked regulatory compliance first, 30% said difficulty managing risks, and 29% said lack of a governance model.",
      "Easterly says despite some of the risks AI can pose, she said she is not surprised that the government has not taken more steps to regulate the technology.",
      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",
      "An increasing number of companies are using AI for everyday tasks. (iStock)",
      "Congress has considered overarching protections for AI, but it has mostly been state governments enacting the rules.",
      "\"There are certainly many things that are positive about what AI does. It also, when fallen into the hands of bad actors, it can destroy [the music] industry,\" said Gov. Bill Lee, R-Tenn., while signing state legislation in March to protect musicians from AI.",
      "The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, or ELVIS Act, classifies vocal likeness as a property right. Lee signed the legislation this year, making Tennessee the first state to enact protections for singers. Illinois and California have since passed similar laws. Other states, including Tennessee, have laws that determine names, photographs and likenesses are also considered a property right.",
      "\"Our voices and likenesses are indelible parts of us that have enabled us to showcase our talents and grow our audiences, not mere digital kibble for a machine to duplicate without consent,\" country recording artist Lainey Wilson said during a congressional hearing on AI and intellectual property.",
      "AI HORROR FLICK STAR KATHERINE WATERSTON ADMITS NEW TECH IS \u2018TERRIFYING\u2019",
      "Wilson argued her image and likeness were used through AI to sell products that she had not previously endorsed.",
      "\"For decades, we have taken advantage of technology that, frankly, was not created to be secure. It was created for speed to market or cool features. And frankly, that's why we have cybersecurity,\" Easterly said.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has cracked down on some deceptive AI marketing techniques. It launched \"Operation AI Comply\" in September, which tackles unfair and deceptive business practices using AI, such as fake reviews written by chatbots.",
      "\"I am a technologist at heart, and I am an optimist at heart. And so I am incredibly excited about some of these capabilities. And I am not concerned about some of the Skynet things. I do want to make sure that this technology is designed and developed and tested and delivered in a way to ensure that security is prioritized,\" Easterly said.",
      "A close-up of the icon of the ChatGPT artificial intelligence chatbot app logo on a cellphone screen.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Chatbots have had some good reviews. Hawaii approved a law this year to invest more in research utilizing AI tools in the health care field. It comes as one study finds, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot outperformed doctors in diagnosing medical conditions. The experiment compared doctors using ChatGPT with those using conventional resources. Both groups scored around 75% accuracy, while the chatbot alone scored above 90%.",
      "AI isn\u2019t just being used for disease detection, it\u2019s also helping emergency crews detect catastrophic events. After deadly wildfires devastated Maui, Hawaii state lawmakers also allocated funds to the University of Hawaii to map statewide wildfire risks and improve forecasting technologies. It also includes $1 million for an AI-driven platform. Hawaiian Electric is also deploying high-resolution cameras across the state.",

      "California and Colorado have similar technology. Within minutes, the AI can detect when a fire begins and where it may spread.",
      "AI is also being used to keep students safe. Several school districts around the country now have firearm detection systems. One in Utah notifies officials within seconds of when a gun might be on campus.",

      "Maryland and Massachusetts are also considering state funds to implement similar technology. Both states voted to establish commissions to study emerging firearm technologies. Maryland\u2019s commission will determine whether to use school construction funding to build the systems. Massachusetts members will look at risks associated with the new technology.",
      "\"We want to use these capabilities to ensure that we can better defend the critical infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day,\" Easterly said.",
      "The European Union passed regulations for AI this year. It ranks risks from minimal, which have no regulations, to unacceptable, which are banned. Chatbots are classified as specific transparency and are required to inform users they are interacting with a machine. Software for critical infrastructure is considered high risk and must comply with strict requirements. Most technology that profiles individuals or uses public images to build-up databases is considered unacceptable.",

To put that into perspective, it's like carving out a small town's worth of earth annually. Currently stretching about 0.6 miles long and 0.5 miles wide at its widest point, this behemoth shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it's speeding up, driven by a vicious cycle of warming temperatures and melting ice. This study was published in the\u00a0journal Geomorphology.",

When this frozen soil thaws, it can't support the weight above it, leading to collapse and the formation of these massive \"slumps.\" The Batagaika crater is a prime example of this process in overdrive. As the permafrost melts, it exposes more soil to sunlight, which then melts more permafrost. It's a feedback loop that's difficult to break, especially in our warming world.",

The steep walls of this mega-slump reveal permafrost layers estimated to be 650,000 years old. That's older than our species. But with ancient ice comes ancient dangers. Scientists have already revived a 48,500-year-old \"zombie virus\" from Arctic permafrost, and there's concern about what other long-dormant pathogens might be awakening.

According to recent studies, this single mega-slump is responsible for releasing 4,000 to 5,000 tons of organic carbon every year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1,000 cars. This release of carbon, previously locked away in the frozen ground, further contributes to global warming, potentially accelerating the very process that created the crater in the first place.",

As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

There's the data that we can actually collect to increase yields and improve the nutritional quality. But then there's also the facilitate facilitating of reductions in labor availability,\" said Mason Earles, an assistant professor at UC Davis in the departments of Viticulture & Enology and Biological & Agricultural Engineering and researcher at the AI Institute for Next Generation Food Systems or AIFS.",
      "In the 1930s, there were around 6.8 million farms in the United States. In 2023, the number of farms declined to around 1.9 million. (AI Institute For Next Generation Food Systems)",
      "The most recent data shows 41% of farmers reported labor shortages in 2018. That\u2019s a 27% increase from those reporting shortages in 2014. The trend is expected to continue. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a 2% decline in workers through 2033 despite the number of job openings remaining the same.",
      "\"We do more with less. It's not that it has no set way and has totally changed the traditional work, it is empowering, and it is increasing the productivity of existing workers,\" said Ilias Tagkopoulos, a computer science professor at UC Davis and the director of AIFS.",

      "\"One of the big things that I specifically focus on, and we work at the Institute for Food Systems is trying to say, how can I make an impact in agriculture and food systems across the board? Whether that has to do with production of different types of vegetables, fruits, nuts, other types of meats or other types of foods,\" Earles said. \"There\u2019s a lot of potential, we think, all the way from going from the research and lab side through startups, through corporate innovation. And we're here to kind of find a way to facilitate and integrate that along the way.\"",
      "A USDA study shows just 27% of farmers are using emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence. Investment is expected to grow across the industry from more than $2 billion this year to more than $5 in 2028.",

Our mission is to leverage AI to build that, to help towards that goal,\" Tagkopoulos said. \"AI is doing two things. One is making businesses more productive. And the second is to accelerate innovation. It accelerates innovation by actually focusing on what matters versus what's out there.\"",
      "Researchers are looking into how AI hardware like sensors or robotics can better gather data in the field.",

And the consumer sees better fruit, veggies and other products that are coming out of those fields,\" Earles said.",

      "Controlled environments or indoor farming also see high upfront costs. But some studies have shown that higher crop yields are possible because of fewer weather-related challenges and the ability to grow year-round.",
      "\"We see in the future more data being generated, more tools becoming available, easier, much less expensive in terms of AI tools to be able to give recommendations on when to irrigate, when to farm, where to sell.

      "How the Spotify scam works",
      "As reported by\u00a0BleepingComputer, this scam works by misusing Spotify\u2019s popularity and trustworthiness. Scammers exploit Spotify playlists by injecting targeted keywords, such as \"free download,\" \"crack\" or \"warez,\" into titles and descriptions.",
      "These keywords are designed to align with popular search terms. Since Spotify\u2019s web player pages are indexed by search engines like Google, these spammy results appear in user searches, driving traffic to their links. For example, a Spotify playlist titled \"Sony Vegas Pro 13 Crack\u2026\" was found promoting \"free\" software sites in its title and description, directing users to questionable external links.",
      "The scam isn\u2019t limited to playlists. It extends to podcasts as well. Scammers create podcasts with multiple short episodes, typically under 20 seconds, using synthesized speech to direct listeners to click links in the description for free content. These podcasts often target users searching for pirated ebooks, audiobooks or game cheats. While the content may appear legitimate at first glance, clicking on the links often results in being redirected to unsafe pages that further exploit users.",

If you see a Spotify playlist or podcast offering \"free\" versions of paid content, it\u2019s likely a scam. Cross-check the legitimacy of the content through known channels instead of relying on unverified links.",

      "3. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex and unique passwords for your Spotify account and avoid using personal information like birthdays or pet names. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Be skeptical of synthesized speech and short episodes: Many scam podcasts feature short episodes (10-20 seconds) with synthesized speech directing you to click on a link in the description. These are a common tactic used to trick users into visiting unsafe pages. If the content feels automated, vague or overly promotional, it\u2019s best to avoid it.",
      "5. Verify curator credentials: Check the credentials of playlist curators. Legitimate curators usually have a verifiable online presence. If you can't find any information about them, it's best to avoid engaging with them.",
      "6. Recognize phishing attempts: Be cautious of emails claiming to be from Spotify that ask you to confirm account details or click on suspicious links. These are often phishing attempts designed to steal your credentials.",
      "7. Report and block suspicious content: If you come across playlists or podcasts that seem fraudulent or inappropriate,\u00a0report them directly to Spotify. Use Spotify\u2019s reporting tools to flag content that violates its platform rules. Blocking suspicious accounts or playlists also ensures you won\u2019t accidentally interact with them in the future, and reporting helps Spotify improve its filtering and moderation systems.",
      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Scammers will use any means possible to trick you. In the past, we\u2019ve seen bad actors weaponize\u00a0Google search results with malicious websites that install malware when links are clicked on. There have also been plenty of\u00a0SEO scams targeting users. Companies like Spotify need to implement measures to prevent their platforms from being misused by scammers. Google also has a responsibility to ensure the quality of its search results.

(Ramirez Baez, left | Michael Dorgan/Fox News Digital, right)",
      "He said the then-unknown political novice had been a fresh face on the scene who promised to work hard for the people of Corona, Jackson Heights and Elmhurst and to be an on-the-ground presence for them, unlike career politician Crowley, who at that point was a 10-term incumbent and eyeing to be the next House speaker.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez, Ramirez Baez said, reached out to him for help when she had about $39,000 in the bank, compared to Crowley\u2019s nearly $2 million war chest.",
      "Ramirez Baez, who is well-connected in the area, particularly among his fellow Dominican immigrants, introduced Ocasio-Cortez to many business owners, campaigned with her and even forked out the cash to pay for their debate venue, he said. The move proved crucial in swaying the electorate, as Crowley never turned up, and Ramirez Baez said it swung the momentum to Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "\"I paid for that debate, I have an invoice for everything I did for Ms. Alexandria,\" Ramirez Baez said, waving a document to the camera. He said he has all his expenses from her campaign documented in one of the many books he has written about her.",
      "But since Ocasio-Cortez rose to power, Ramirez Baez said she has been missing in action and has acted no differently from Crowley.",
      "\"We never saw that lady, never, she disappeared,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"She [didn\u2019t] do anything for the community, nothing, nothing.\"",
      "\"She disappeared from my community. You never saw Alexandria in my community, nobody saw her in her office. All the time, closed,\" he said of her Queens office, which was located a block from his own apartment.",
      "Ramirez Baez said locals don't know how to get in touch with her office as she doesn't appear to have any in Queens. Ocasio-Cortez's website lists an office in Queens, by appointment only, which is the same address as the office of New York City Councilwoman Tiffany Caban.",
      "\"What happened? You have to be [in the] community to do an event,\" he said. \"She never did any event. I never saw Alexandria come to do a town hall meeting, to listen to the community, nothing. She disappeared.\"",
      "\"She goes all over the place, like a movie star, she goes to Texas, all over the place, but what about the community?\"",
      "Ramirez Baez said Ocasio-Cortez did hold a town hall in the neighborhood in May 2023, but since then, crime, particularly prostitution, has exploded, and she has not engaged with the community on those matters. He said the rally was extremely limited and residents had to apply to attend, with her office denying entry to those it deemed as hostile to her positions. Even other local Democrats who told Fox News Digital they, too, were denied entry.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez spoke at a rally in support of illegal vendors a few months later and quickly left before questions could be asked, he said.",
      "Ramirez Baez, who said he did not know about Ocasio-Cortez's socialist leanings at the time, said he has buyer's remorse about pushing the community to support her.",
      "\"If she said to me, she is socialist, I would never support it,\"\u00a0Ramirez Baez declared. He said that part of her socialist agenda is an open-border policy with regard to immigration, which he opined has contributed to the decline of the neighborhood as many illegal vendors and sex workers on Roosevelt Avenue are migrants who have no jobs or work permits and also clog up resources.",
      "\"She only defends the socialist agenda, which is not for the American people. \u2026 She doesn\u2019t understand what [socialism] means,\" said Ramirez Baez, who added that he understands it because he has lived in Cuba and the former Soviet Union. \"She was a little confused in her head, confused in that ideology.\"",
      "\"The Democrats opened the border, and a lot of people that nobody knows have come. Alexandria was in Texas [saying] \u2018Come on, people from New York have the money,\u2019 and that\u2019s why right now you have that situation in our neighborhood.\"",

      "Fox News Digital reached out to Ocasio-Cortez's office for comment in relation to Ramirez Baez but did not receive a response.",
      "Ramirez Baez has been busy trying to clean up Roosevelt Avenue and founded a group called \"Let's Improve Roosevelt Ave,\" which advocates for more police on the ground. That request eventually materialized last month when the mayor and governor deployed more than 200 police officers and state troopers to patrol the troubled neighborhood.",

      "\"I remember you questioning the integrity of other politicians and their promises. My support and collaboration helped you secure your victory. I believed you would champion the best interests of our community, I was wrong,\" Ramirez Baez wrote in the Oct. 23 letter.",
      "\"Watching your career unfold, I saw you more focused on staying in the spotlight and getting media attention than on real issues facing your constituents. While you travel across the country, and engage in various performances, our community continues to struggle. Your appearance in high-fashion attire stands in stark contrast to the hardships our hard-working people endure.\"",

You have failed to even speak about the crime that affects our neighborhood and you failed to protect the vulnerable women exploited by these criminal networks.\"",
      "On one block along Roosevelt Avenue, Fox News Digital cameras recorded a line of no fewer than 19 suspected sex workers on a sidewalk in September.

      "\"Have you reviewed the polls of how many Latinos are defecting from the Democratic Party because of the radical policies you espouse?\" Ramirez Baez asked. \"Take a look at Roosevelt Avenue, breathe our air and see your failures.\"",

Under its terms, Hezbollah is required to withdraw north of the Litani River, and Israeli forces will pull back from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The agreement marks a significant step but faces immediate challenges, with both sides accusing the other of violations. Against this backdrop, the role of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) is facing renewed scrutiny.",

      "Ali also pointed to historical U.N. peacekeeping failures, such as those in Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans, as cautionary examples. \"In decades past, there are other examples of the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping elements to prevent either the outbreak or dramatic escalation of armed conflict between combatants in similarly small countries with complex ethnic, tribal, or religious divisions.\"",

      "An IDF official told Fox News Digital that during the 14 months of fighting in South Lebanon, \"We\u2019ve seen Hezbollah use U.N. convoys to get close to the border - a Hezbollah car just entered the convoy and tagged along with them to safely gather intelligence.

Everyone played the game - they knew Hezbollah was there, walking freely among them. And nothing was done.\"",
      "UNIFIL responded to the criticism by emphasizing its limited mandate. \"The implementation of Resolution 1701 is the responsibility of the parties, Lebanon and Israel,\" Andrea Teneti, a UNIFIL spokesperson, said. \"UNIFIL supports the parties\u2019 implementation, monitors, and reports on violations. We do not have the mandate to enforce the resolution, nor to disarm Hezbollah by force.\"",
      "The spokesperson pointed to the unprecedented period of stability from 2006 to 2023 as evidence of UNIFIL\u2019s contributions, despite both parties failing to implement their obligations. UNIFIL acknowledged that the proliferation of weapons outside state control in southern Lebanon remains a violation of Resolution 1701, adding, \"The removal of unauthorized weapons can only be achieved through the full implementation of Resolution 1701. There is no military solution.\"",

By all accounts, UNIFIL did little to prevent this operational buildup or prevent the escalation in Hezbollah attacks after October 7.\"",
      "Following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah opened another front in the war along the northern border, launching hundreds of rockets, anti-tank missiles and UAVs into Israeli territory. Alarmingly, many of these attacks originated near UNIFIL bases. \"Over 430 Hezbollah projectiles have landed in and around UNIFIL outposts,\" an IDF military official reported. \"Yet the U.N. has only twice named Hezbollah explicitly as responsible for these attacks.\"",
      "\"The actions of both the IDF and Hezbollah are putting peacekeepers in danger, whether through crossfire or deliberate acts\", said Teneti. \"We name a party only when we are sure about the source of fire impacting the mission and Hezbollah has been mentioned several times as responsible for some of those attacks.\"",
      "The IDF has provided Fox News Digital with further evidence of Hezbollah\u2019s violations, including fortified positions and training centers. In one instance, a Hezbollah facility packed with weapons and attack plans was discovered just 200 meters from a UNIFIL base. \"You had to walk past the facility to even reach the U.N. base,\" an IDF officer noted.",
      "The IDF said its \"soldiers are continuing to conduct limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hezbollah terrorists and dismantling terror infrastructure and weapons stockpiles both above and below ground.\" (IDF spokesman's unit)",

Despite daily reports of violations, nothing happened.\"",

President Biden this week steps onto African soil for the first time in his presidency, in a visit to Angola seen by many as an attempt to leave a legacy. But China, analysts say, is threatening, through a decade of investment in Africa, to thwart the Biden administration\u2019s aims to bring sweet memories in Africa of his time in the White House.",
      "\"The headline on Biden\u2019s legacy in Africa is likely to be \u2018over-promised and under-delivered,\u2019\" analyst Cameron Hudson told Fox News Digital. Hudson, director of African affairs at the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration, and now senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Affairs, added, \"Biden set high expectations that he would revamp relations with the continent, when instead his approach and results have not substantially differed from any of his predecessors.\"",

      "\"While it (Biden\u2019s administration) contrasted with the first Trump term in upgrading the optics and rhetoric of U.S. engagement, it remains unclear how many of the announced projects will be completed. Overall, Africa was included in Biden's approach of coalition-building as a response to growing Chinese power. His term also saw the positioning of critical minerals as a key U.S. strategic priority. However, so far this hasn't translated to many gains on the African side,\" he said.",
      "Speaking at a special State Department briefing on Biden\u2019s Angola trip, Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, pushed back on criticism. Referring to the African leaders\u2019 confab in 2022,\u00a0he noted, \"At that summit, we \u2013 the U.S. \u2013 pledged to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years. We are over-delivering on that thus far. Two years later, we\u2019ve spent \u2013 we\u2019ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.\"",
      "At another briefing, senior Biden administration officials noted that over \"the past two years since the Africa Leaders Summit, the administration has had over 20 Cabinet level and senior officials travel to the continent,\" the senior official added, \"I think this administration is about the totality of those visits and those initiatives, and we're proud of our record on that front.\"",

      "Brown claimed last week that \"billions of dollars have been mobilized\" in the Lobito Rail Corridor, a planned 800-mile railway that is central to Biden\u2019s Angola visit \u2013 and his legacy. Brown claimed it is one of his \u2018signature initiatives\u2019.",
      "The rail system will stretch from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and a point close to Zambia, to the port of Lobito, on Angola\u2019s Atlantic seaboard. Washington is hoping that it can be used to transport critical raw materials (CRMs), such as cobalt and lithium, needed for the likes of electric vehicles, EV, batteries, and cut down transit time from the current 45 days to under a week.",
      "\"The International Energy Agency (IEA) has estimated that between 2020 and 2040, demand for nickel and cobalt will increase by 20 times, for graphite 25 times, and for lithium more than 40 times,\" Dr. E.D. Wala Chabala wrote in a recent paper for the Africa Policy Research Institute.",

      "Chabala, a former chairman of Zambia Railways and an economic policy consultant, added, \"This projected surge in demand for CRMs has fueled great interest in the Lobito Corridor, and with it an inevitable scramble for access. The DRC, as the world\u2019s largest producer of cobalt (estimates are consistently around 70% of global production), has found itself at the epicenter of this scramble, as has, by association, Zambia.\"",
      "But there\u2019s a large panda in the room: China. Chabala pointed out\u00a0\"the targeted materials (CRMs) are mostly already locked in by China, and\u00a0the Asians are leaders in EV technology.\"",
      "Chabala added, \"Not only are the Chinese ubiquitously present on the African continent, but China is already far ahead in building supply chains for cobalt, lithium, and several other essential metals and minerals. And what is more, China is moving to take over the running of the TAZARA railway line, which runs from central Zambia to the port of Dar es Salaam on the Indian Ocean.\"",

      "\"The reality of the Lobito Corridor development is that it may be coming too late in the day. What is more, there is a proposed route, shorter by some 500 km, to the east between Lubumbashi and Dar es Salaam.\"",
      "\"The European Union (EU) and the U.S. are not currently leaders in EV technology. It is reported that almost 90% of cell component manufacturing, the most significant step in the battery value chain, is undertaken in Asia,\" Chabala said.",
      "Van Staden told Fox News Digital, \"The viability of the rail corridor partially depends on external factors. It will compete with the TAZARA rail line between Zambia and Tanzania, which will be upgraded by Chinese companies over the next few years. There will likely be pressure from the African side to connect the two lines, because that would realize a long-held goal to connect the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coasts.\"",
      "\"The U.S. has no choice but to seek access to critical minerals in Africa, as many of these are crucial components to the kind of high-tech manufacturing that the U.S. is trying to remain competitive in,\" Hudson told Fox News Digital, adding, \"We simply cannot afford to cede that territory to China, nor is it too late to try to claw back our influence in this sector.\"",
      "Nigeriens protest against the U.S. military presence, in Niamey, Niger April 13, 2024. (Reuters/Mahamadou Hamidou/File Photo)",
      "\"More importantly, there is an opening to do so because Africans want diversity in their economic partnerships. Just as we are wary of China cornering the market on critical minerals in certain countries, so too are those countries worried about being so beholden to Chinese interests.\"",
      "Hudson continued, \"The Lobito project is really a proof of concept that the U.S. can and should be undertaking the kind of large-scale commercial infrastructure projects similar to what China has been doing on the continent for decades. \u00a0Importantly, it is a recognition that we have heard the calls from African leaders that they want a relationship that is based on \u2019trade not aid.\u2019\"",

      "Chabala told Fox News Digital this week that another factor working against U.S. interests is that the Chinese are involved in ownership of the mines producing CRMs in the DRC. \"They own 80% of the largest cobalt producer in Congo, they are heavily involved in the EV battery value chain, with the bulk of the value chain activities being undertaken in Asia, and they are currently the number one global producer of EVs (the Chinese auto manufacturer BYD),\" he said.",
      "He added, \"The long-term strategy of the EU and U.S. ought to be to invest and establish strong counterweight economies, so much so that the impact and consequences of the Chinese economic dynamics are counterbalanced. The African continent has 1.4 billion people, 60% below the age of 24, with a landmass of more than 30 million square kilometers (over 11 million square miles).\"",
      "Congolese flags fly alongside Chinese flags at the Palais des Congres in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, March 29, 2013. (Junior D. Kannah/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"This is double the population of the EU and U.S., and almost double their landmasses. The quantities of materials on the African continent and the potential they represent for the global economy are astounding. This represents [an] unfathomable potential for establishing industries on the continent, not only to counterweight the Chinese economy, but to lock in a future market for all the top brands of EU and U.S. businesses. The mind boggles that the EU and U.S. have not embarked on pursuing this strategy, decades ago.\"",
      "Van Staden noted, \"Chinese actors make up less than 10% of all the mining done on the continent and there is space for more engagement from many stakeholders, as long as that happens on African terms.\"",

      "Hudson concluded that, with his new administration, President-elect \"Trump needs to be paying attention, treating Africans as equal partners, not talking down to them, and recognizing that they have choices. If we want Africa to choose us, then it will be through the attractiveness of our offer and not as a result of pressure.\"",

      "Brazil's Federal Police in late November formally accused far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 others of planning a coup to keep him in office. The agency described a multistep scheme, substantiated by evidence and testimony, in an 884-page report.",
      "The plan included systematically sowing distrust of the electoral system among the populace, drafting a decree to give the plot a veneer of legal basis, pressuring top military brass to go along with the plan, and inciting a riot in the capital.",
      "CONSERVATIVE BRAZILIANS LAUD ELON MUSK AT RALLY IN SUPPORT OF BOLSONARO",
      "Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet will now decide whether to formally charge the accused parties, toss the investigation or request more testimony to understand each person\u2019s participation in different parts of the alleged plot before deciding who stands trial on which counts. Bolsonaro and his main allies have denied any wrongdoing or involvement and accuse the authorities of political persecution.",
      "Former President Jair Bolsonaro arrives to speak with the press after being formally charged by the federal police with attempted coup, at the airport in Brasilia, Brazil, Monday, Nov. 25, 2024.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)",
      "Here is a breakdown of the plan's key elements as laid out in the report and how they are supposedly connected.",
      "Sowing doubt about Brazil\u2019s voting system",
      "Police allege that efforts to disseminate fake news about Brazil\u2019s electronic voting system began in 2019, Bolsonaro\u2019s first year in office, but were conducted more strategically and intensively as his 2022 reelection bid drew near.",
      "Police say so-called \"digital militias\" comprised of thousands of social media accounts linked to pro-Bolsonaro propaganda, as well as other prominent right-wing influencers and politicians, spread propaganda claiming the voting system could be tampered with. Bolsonaro also openly expressed admiration for Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship (1964-1985), which he claimed saved the country from communism.",
      "The narrative of an impending illegitimate election defeat helped Bolsonaro rally tens of thousands of supporters to multiple street demonstrations and also muster many to set up camp outside military barracks and headquarters to pressure leaders.",
      "Three months before the election, Bolsonaro invited dozens of diplomats to the presidential palace for a nationally televised meeting in which he presented supposed vulnerabilities of the voting system, without providing any evidence.",
      "Following Bolsonaro\u2019s loss in 2022 to leftist Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, Bolsonaro's Liberal Party questioned results at the country's top electoral court, arguing voting devices made in specific years could have permitted fraud. The electoral court swiftly dismissed the claims.",
      "\"They spread false studies on the vulnerabilities of the electronic voting machines through the Liberal Party, in an attempt to create a factual basis for a presidential decree\" that would set the coup in motion, the report says.",
      "A draft decree to set the coup in motion",
      "In January 2023, Brazilian police found a draft decree in the home of Bolsonaro\u2019s former justice minister Anderson Torres. It was one of many versions drafted either at the far-right leader's behest or with his knowledge, police say. The former president presented the document, unsigned, to the commanders of the three divisions of the armed forces on Dec. 7, seeking their support.",
      "Investigators say the draft decree shows Bolsonaro and his allies sought to create a committee to probe alleged fraud and crimes in the October 2022 vote, so they could later suspend the powers of the nation\u2019s top electoral court and possibly convene a new election.",
      "The navy\u2019s commander was ready to comply with the decree, but army and air force leaders objected to any plan that would prevent Lula's inauguration, the report said. Those refusals are why the plan did not go ahead, according to witnesses who spoke to investigators.",
      "Many legal experts including say evidence that former president presented the draft to military leaders and supported for different versions of the document are very damaging.",
      "\"(The goal) was to unduly intervene in elections,\" said Luiz Henrique Machado, a law professor at the IDP university in the capital Brasilia. \"In Brazil, it is the electoral prosecutors' office and the top electoral court that have the final word about electoral legislation.\"",
      "In an interview with website UOL published Thursday, Bolsonaro said he discussed with military leaders moves including decreeing a state of emergency and other exceptional measures that would have suspended the rule of law for the public good. He said such measures are provided for by the constitution, so there is nothing unseemly about evaluating those options.",
      "\"What is being said is absurd. For my part, there has never been any discussion of a coup,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in Brasilia on Monday.",
      "Plan to assassinate the president-elect",
      "On Nov. 19, Brazil's Federal Police arrested four army special operations officers and a federal police officer accused of plotting in 2022 to assassinate Lula, vice-president-elect Geraldo Alckmin and Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes. The arrested men were all mentioned in a police report that was unsealed later.",
      "The assassination plan sought to leave Bolsonaro's ticket as the only remaining valid one in the 2022 runoff, police say. As for de Moraes, he led a five-year probe into fake news and threats against Supreme Court justices, which has led some far-right allies and supporters being barred from social media and even imprisoned. In early 2023, he presided over the nation\u2019s top electoral court when it declared Bolsonaro ineligible for office until 2030 over abuse of power related to a meeting he convened with foreign ambassadors to spread lies about the voting system.",
      "Gen. Walter Braga Netto, Bolsonaro\u2019s 2022 running mate and former defense minister, greenlit the assassination plan at a meeting with the plotters inside his home, investigators added. Federal Police portray the retired general as one of the plot's leaders, also involved in pressuring military leaders to sign onto the coup.",
      "Braga Netto said in a statement on Tuesday that he never plotted a coup. He added that several of the documents seized from one of his aides, including \"writings, drafts and media reports\" were \"preparatory material to answer media requests and to prepare for testimony in congressional hearings.\"",
      "The police report contains no indication that any attempt to assassinate Lula or Alckmin was put into motion. However, investigators found messages and documents indicating that the plotters were monitoring and following de Moraes at the time.",
      "Police said they found evidence that retired Brig. Gen. M\u00e1rio Fernandes, one of the officers arrested who had been serving as interim general secretary of the presidency, also visited the protest camps outside military installations, including at the army headquarters in Brasilia. Investigators said they have evidence that he gave instructions and financial support to the protesters.",
      "Jan. 8 uprising",
      "Federal Police linked Bolsonaro and some of his top ministers to the Jan. 8, 2023 riot in which supporters of the former president, many of whom had been camped outside army headquarters for months, ransacked the Supreme Court, Congress and presidential palace in Brasilia.",
      "The protesters had pleaded for the armed forces to keep the leftist leader out of office and their uprising \u2014 which came after Lula was sworn in \u2014 was an attempt to force military intervention and oust the new president, police say.",
      "The riot appears in the report as one of several \"other actions to pressure the army commander to join the coup d\u2019etat.\" Police also say that Brig. Gen. Fernandes sent a message in November 2022 to Gen. Marco Ant\u00f4nio Freire Gomes, then the Army's commander, discussing the need for a \"triggering event\" for a coup.",
      "Defendants, including Bolsonaro, have argued that the riot was an isolated event, and many legal experts have noted that the report's evidence of a connection between it and a broader plot is tenuous.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"It is clear that the alleged coup plotters had contacts with people camped outside military barracks, people who were there on Jan. 8. But how much of that contact was transformed into planning, coordination, stimulus for those people to take public buildings that day? That is to be debated, it is going to be discussed in the process and the collection of more evidence,\" said Jo\u00e3o Pedro P\u00e1dua, a professor of criminal law proceedings at the Universidade Federal Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "Bolsonaro left for the United States days before Lula\u2019s inauguration on Jan. 1, 2023 and stayed there three months, keeping a low profile. The police report alleges he was avoiding possible imprisonment related to the coup plot and awaiting the fallout from the uprising."

      "\"We can\u2019t forget that one of these groups, HTS has been designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization. I think Israel\u2019s degradation of Hezbollah emboldened the anti-Assad forces as they smelled blood in the water with this assault on Aleppo. It\u2019s not only Hezbollah\u2019s losses, but also the IRGC\u2019s [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] losses which are testing the Quds Force\u2019s structures in Syria.",

      "The United States government has designated both Iran\u2019s regime and the Syrian Arab Republic as state-sponsors of terrorism.",
      "Phillip Smyth, an expert on Iranian regime proxy groups and Syria, who is with the Atlantic Council, told Fox News Digital, \"If you were thinking Assad was sending out or had anything elite and functional for fighting forces, recall that nearly every successful offensive for pro-Assad side was executed by Iran and Iran proxies and or Russia since 2013 and 2015, respectively.\"",

      "This person added that Trump\u2019s children and his wife, Melania, are particularly confident in incoming White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, who co-managed the campaign.",
      "\u201cSusie ran the best of his three campaigns, and she\u2019ll run the best White House that he\u2019s had,\u201d the former senior Trump White House official said. \u201cHe had four chiefs of staff. Susie is set up to be the best of all of them.\u201d",
      "Nevertheless, Trump\u2019s children will remain close to and influential in his orbit.",
      "Donald Trump Jr., who kept a busy campaign schedule this year for his father and for down-ballot candidates endorsed by his father, has developed a close relationship with Vance, who is a safe bet to run as the term-limited Trump\u2019s successor in four years.",
      "\u201cWe are getting four more years of Trump and then eight years of JD Vance!\u201d Trump Jr. said at an October campaign event for Sen.-elect Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio.",
      "Eric Trump will continue as executive vice president of the Trump Organization and run \u201cevery facet of the hotel, golf, commercial, residential, retail and other related holdings,\u201d Kimberly Benza, the company\u2019s director of executive operations and communications, wrote in an email.",
      "His wife, Lara Trump, meanwhile, is a Republican National Committee co-chair. And if Trump world gets its way, she will take the soon-to-be-vacant seat held by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., whom Trump intends to nominate for secretary of state.",
      "Trump family members and key allies like billionaire Elon Musk have publicly pushed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to appoint her as Rubio\u2019s successor \u2014 a position that could make her the family member with the most practical political sway early in Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "\u201cI think she understands our base; she understands the movement,\u201d Trump Jr. said in a Fox News interview last month. \u201cYou see what\u2019s going on in Florida. I mean, it is a solid red state. We have flipped counties that we lost by 30 and 40 points back in 2016, and they are now positive for Trump.\u201d",
      "DeSantis advisers told NBC News last month that Lara Trump is being considered, but other DeSantis allies are also on the short list. The governor, whose relationship with Trump deteriorated after he challenged him for the GOP presidential nomination this year, could run for president again in 2028. Bypassing Lara Trump for the seat could further alienate him from the Trump base.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question DeSantis knows what the position is,\u201d a Trump ally familiar with the family\u2019s thinking said. \u201cThere are two different ways he can go with this, and it will say a lot.\u201d",
      "A changing of the guard",
      "It would be tough to overstate the clout that Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner carried during the first Trump administration.",
      "The couple were first among equals, having survived the palace intrigue and infighting that created constant turnover among Trump\u2019s senior aides. While four chiefs of staff came and went, Kushner and Ivanka Trump stayed until the end. Kushner worked out of an office a few paces from the Oval Office, while Ivanka Trump worked from a third-floor office in the West Wing.",
      "Kushner had a broad policy portfolio during Trump\u2019s first administration that ranged from the Middle East to the administration\u2019s pandemic relief efforts. He helped his father-in-law broker the Abraham Accords, a breakthrough in Middle East relations in which Israel normalized relations with various Arab countries.",
      "Now, the president-elect calls Kushner periodically to get his opinion on some potential hires, the former senior White House official said. Kushner has also spent time talking to Steven Witkoff, whom Trump tapped to be special envoy to the Middle East, helping him \u201cget up to speed\u201d on a part of the world that is beset by war, this person added.",
      "His aim is to be \u201cthe friend and adviser\u201d to Trump\u2019s new team that he \u201cwished\u201d he had had when he joined the Trump White House in 2017, the former official said.",
      "During the transition, Kushner has weighed in on certain appointments and nominations \u2014 one in particular being a plug for private equity executive Marc Rowan to be nominated for treasury secretary, four sources familiar with the conversations said. (Trump instead chose hedge fund executive Scott Bessent.)",
      "When her father launched his most recent White House campaign, Ivanka Trump issued a statement saying she was prioritizing her family and had no plans to return to politics. The couple\u2019s children are ages 8 to 13, and they want to give them a \u201cnormal life,\u201d the former official said.",
      "\u201cHe is going to run his business and continue to build his family,\u201d a source said of Kushner. \u201cHe will, I think, help on things like the Middle East if asked, but he had such a trying experience last time [that] I don\u2019t think he\u2019s interested.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not bad blood,\u201d the person added. \u201cHe\u2019s just going to be doing other things.\u201d",
      "The son rises",
      "As Ivanka Trump and Kushner faded from the spotlight in recent years, Donald Trump Jr. took a more central role in his father\u2019s political affairs. He and his partner, Kimberly Guilfoyle, have become staples on the GOP campaign trail and fundraising circuit, aggressively promoting candidates close to Trump or tightly in tune with his Make America Great Again movement.",
      "When Trump seemed to be leaning toward North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum for the No. 2 spot on the 2024 ticket, Trump Jr. and Eric Trump steered him back toward Vance, NBC News reported in July. And after Karl Rove \u2014 a GOP strategist and talking head reviled in Trump world \u2014 made the case for Burgum on Fox News, Trump Jr. printed out the Breitbart News article that highlighted Rove\u2019s praise and promptly showed it to his father.",
      "\u201cThe reality is I chose [Vance] in part because I understood his demeanor and, you know, character,\u201d Trump Jr. told reporters after Vance\u2019s vice presidential debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "Trump Jr. also has been involved in the transition, speaking for or against particular candidates. His negative feedback on former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo may have helped scuttle Pompeo\u2019s chances of serving in the next Trump administration.",
      "But Trump Jr. has several private ventures occupying his time, including a podcast he has used to advance his political views. He also recently announced plans to join a venture capital firm that has invested in Trump ally Tucker Carlson\u2019s new media venture and joined the advisory board for Unusual Machines, a Florida-based drone company.",
      "A source close to Trump Jr. said he has no designs on an official or unofficial position in Trump\u2019s White House. After Trump\u2019s inauguration next month, his eldest son plans to focus on those business pursuits and his family.",
      "\u201cYou can expect Don to keep vocally supporting his dad and his agenda from the outside,\u201d the source added. \u201cBut don\u2019t expect him to be some kind of gatekeeper to the White House come Jan. 20.\u201d",
      "Trump Jr. is also expected to continue to stay close with Vance.",
      "\u201cDon Jr. is going to do the private equity thing and continue crushing life,\u201d a longtime Trump adviser said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he will keep a large social media presence and also largely suck up to Vance and continue to be seen as one of his closest guys.\u201d"

      "Covid vaccines have overwhelmingly been shown to be safe, and no supplement has been found to alleviate side effects.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, promoted a supplement line this year that purports without evidence to help people \u201cdetox\u201d from Covid vaccines.",
      "Patel plugged the supplements in posts on Truth Social \u2014 the social media platform owned by Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 in February and April.",
      "\u201cMrna detox, reverse the vaxx n get healthy,\u201d he wrote in one post, tagging the company Warrior Essentials and linking to its website. \u201cSpike the Vax, order this homerun kit to rid your body of the harms of the vax,\u201d he wrote in another. It is not clear whether the posts were paid promotions; they were not labeled as such.",
      "Warrior Essentials sells what it calls a \u201cSpike Protein Detox Protocol,\u201d a set of up to three supplements that it claims, without evidence, will \u201cundo the damage from the spike protein,\u201d a component of the coronavirus. The mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna prompt the body to produce and fight an altered version of the protein to train the immune system.",
      "Warrior Essentials is one of many companies that trade on unfounded theories about the dangers of vaccines, which have proliferated in the alt-right social media landscape since the pandemic \u2014 ideas that are not backed by science.",
      "Patel, who was chief of staff to acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller during the Trump administration, is among Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters. He has leveraged his association with Trump to sell books and merchandise. Patel received $120,000 per year as an independent contractor with Trump Media & Technology Group, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in June, as part of a contract that ended in March.",
      "As FBI director, Patel would oversee more than 37,000 employees at the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency and a requested annual budget of roughly $11.3 billion.",
      "A representative for Patel did not respond to a request for comment; neither did the Trump transition team.",
      "Warrior Essentials told NBC News that it was \u201cproud to have Kash Patel as a supporter and advocate.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile the so-called \u2018experts\u2019 who ignored vaccine injuries and pushed failed policies scramble to defend their narratives, we deliver real, science-backed solutions that have already helped thousands reclaim their health,\u201d the company said.",
      "Warrior Essentials says that its \u201cdetox protocol\u201d \u201cpromotes the body\u2019s own internal cellular regeneration process\u201d and can remove toxins from cells, repair circulatory health and restore DNA stability. None of those claims are supported by scientific research, according to two medical experts.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t say with confidence that their product is going to do what it is that they intend it to do,\u201d said Dr. C. Michael White, head of the pharmacy practice department at the University of Connecticut.",
      "In the vast majority of people, spike proteins leave the body within a few weeks of a vaccine\u2019s being administered. Like other vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration, Covid shots are safe, and serious side effects are rare.",
      "What\u2019s more, the experts said there is no evidence that Warrior Essentials\u2019 supplements are effective at reducing vaccine side effects \u2014 which are mostly mild or moderate and tend to resolve quickly. No supplements have been found to do that.",
      "Dietary supplements do not require FDA approval before they are sold, so their manufacturers have more leeway than producers of foods or drugs when it comes to health claims. Although the FDA can issue warnings and mandate recalls, it does not have the resources to track or assess every supplement available to customers.",
      "\u201cI tell my patients that any claim on a supplement bottle is a yellow flag,\u201d said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School.",
      "He added that although some people have legitimate questions about vaccine side effects, a lack of regulation in the supplement industry allows some makers to take advantage of consumers by selling unproven products.",
      "\u201cThe polarization of America and also the suspicion of science and medicine drive a lot of interest and attention into supplements,\u201d Cohen said.",
      "The couple who founded Warrior Essentials, Dave and Nancy Flynn, have said their son was injured by childhood vaccines in 2006, even though hundreds of large studies show that routine childhood immunizations are safe and protect kids from serious disease.",
      "The Flynns have spread misinformation about Covid vaccines, including false claims that they alter people\u2019s DNA and shed toxic substances that linger in the body.",
      "The chief medical adviser for Warrior Essentials, Dr. George Fareed, is a senior fellow at the Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, a group that promotes disproven treatments for Covid like the antiparasitic drug ivermectin. Neither Fareed nor the alliance responded to requests for comment.",
      "A single bottle of the \u201cdetox\u201d supplement containing 60 capsules (30 two-pill servings) is listed for $75 on the Warrior Essentials website. The set of three supplements marketed together as the full regimen sells for $150. The site suggests taking the pills for three to 12 months.",
      "A list of ingredients on the Warrior Essentials site says the supplements contain a blend of enzymes, amino acids, vitamins, minerals and plant extracts \u2014 including chromium, magnesium, zinc and vitamin D. While some of those ingredients on their own may have health benefits, White said, it is impossible to tell whether they are useful \u2014 let alone safe \u2014 in this context. A blend of ingredients may have different effects from a single vitamin or mineral, he said.",
      "Patel joins a group of vaccine opponents whom Trump plans to nominate to top government posts. Trump\u2019s pick for health and human services secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founded a prominent anti-vaccine activist group and falsely said in a 2013 speech that a nebulous group of people, including vaccine scientists, were involved in a conspiracy to hide vaccines as the cause of autism and \u201cshould be in jail.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s choice to head the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Dave Weldon, has also been an outspoken critic of the agency\u2019s vaccine program.",
      "Others \u2014 including Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, Trump\u2019s choice for surgeon general, and Dr. Martin Makary, whom Trump wants to lead the FDA \u2014 have expressed skepticism or opposition to vaccine mandates, though not necessarily to the shots themselves.",
      "Kennedy has also promised to end what he called the FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of vitamins and supplements."

      "Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's selection to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday that he would withdraw from consideration.",

      "Chronister is a longtime Florida law enforcement official whose father-in-law is Edward DeBartolo Jr., the former owner of the San Francisco 49ers. The pick was widely praised by Republicans in Florida, including by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.",
      "But Chronister ran into a series of hurdles from Trump\u2019s political base because of how he handled the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 particularly his decision in 2020 to arrest Ronald Howard-Browne, a Tampa-area pastor, for the decision to flout pandemic-era lockdown orders. The charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "\"To have been nominated by President-Elect @realDonaldTrump to serve as Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration is the honor of a lifetime,\" Chronister wrote on X on Tuesday evening. \"Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I\u2019ve concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration.\"",

      "Florida Republicans largely saw Chronister as a top-tier pick for Trump, but on late Tuesday, after he withdrew his name, many said they understood the rationale.",
      "\u201cHe was a target for the Covid stuff,\u201d a longtime Florida Republican said. \u201cHe is someone who is seen as a great sheriff here, but there were reasons I think that he got caught up in all this.\u201d",

      "According to Lilly\u2019s trial results, patients who got weekly injections of Zepbound lost an average 20.2% of their body weight, or 50.3 pounds, after 72 weeks, compared with an average of 13.7% body weight, or 33.1 pounds, for those who got Wegovy.",
      "That means, Lilly says, Zepbound provides 47% more weight loss than Wegovy.",
      "Dr. Susan Spratt, an endocrinologist and senior medical director for the Population Health Management Office at Duke Health in North Carolina, said that although Zepbound provided more weight loss than Wegovy, both drugs are highly effective.",
      "\u201cThe amount of weight loss with both is astounding,\u201d Spratt said.",
      "Wednesday\u2019s results were announced in a news release and haven\u2019t been made available for peer review yet.\u00a0Lilly says it plans to present the results at a medical meeting next year.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for Novo Nordisk pointed toward Wegovy's benefits on the heart, saying that \"in combination with diet and exercise, Wegovy is the only obesity medicine proven to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events such as death, heart attack, or stroke.\"",
      "The results were based on 751 adults across the U.S., including Puerto Rico, who were randomized to get one of the two highest doses of either Zepbound or Wegovy.\u00a0People either were overweight or had obesity.",
      "Eli Lilly said the most commonly reported side effects for both Zepound and Wegovy were gastrointestinal-related and \"generally mild to moderate in severity.\"",
      "Dr. Christopher McGowan, a gastroenterologist who runs a weight loss clinic in North Carolina, said the side effects for both Zepbound and Wegovy are generally comparable, although his patients tend to say they fare better on Zepbound.",
      "Side effects from the drugs can include gastrointestinal problems, including abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.",
      "Zepbound contains the active ingredient tirzepatide, the same drug used in Lilly\u2019s diabetes drug Mounjaro. Wegovy contains semaglutide, the drug also in Novo Nordisk\u2019s diabetes drug Ozempic.",
      "Both work in similar ways: The GLP-1 drugs mimic a hormone that helps reduce food intake and appetite.",
      "However, tirzepatide also imitates a second hormone, called GIP, which, along with reducing appetite, is thought to improve how the body breaks down sugar and fat.",
      "Spratt said she\u2019d like to see more data comparing the drugs to health outcomes beyond weight loss.",
      "Wegovy, for example, has been shown to reduce the risk of heart disease in \u200b\u200bpeople who are overweight or have obesity. Zepbound has been shown to be a possible treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that was the aim of this trial, but it will be important in which drug to recommend,\u201d Spratt said.",
      "McGowan said weight loss isn\u2019t the only factor patients consider.",
      "\u201cMost patients who seek a GLP-1 treatment choose whichever they can obtain based on cost, availability and insurance coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few patients can be choosy right now.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a modern shoe \u2014 not something you\u2019d find in a coal mine in Marguerite in 1940,\u201d Bacha said, noting the area where the sinkhole was discovered.",

      "Two months ago, Haris Mujezinovic and Charlie Miller, who played for the Hoosiers in the 1990s under legendary coach\u00a0Bob Knight, sued in U.S. District Court for Southern Indiana. They alleged that their coaches and trainers were aware that Bomba was subjecting basketball players to unnecessary prostate examinations and did nothing to stop him.",

      "Bomba had\u00a0played football for Indiana University\u00a0and was nicknamed \u201cFrankenstein\u201d by coaches and players \u201cdue to the large size of his hands and fingers,\u201d the lawsuit added.",
      "\u201cDr. Bomba, Sr.\u2019s routine sexual assaults were openly discussed by the Hoosier men\u2019s basketball players in the locker room in the presence of IU employees, including assistant coaches, athletic trainers, and other Hoosier men\u2019s basketball staff,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",
      "Mujezinovic, who spent two seasons at Indiana from 1995 to 1997, and Miller, who played for the Hoosiers from 1994 through 1998, seek unspecified damages. They have also urged former teammates to come forward and join their lawsuit.",
      "The accusations that the university turned a blind eye to allegations that a team doctor was sexually abusing players echo a scandal involving a team doctor at a rival school. In 2018, former Ohio State University wrestlers alleged that\u00a0their coaches knew Dr. Richard Strauss, who died in 2005,\u00a0was preying on them but failed to act."

      "Trump transition officials are exploring the possibility of building immigrant detention facilities on a plot of land recently purchased by the state of Texas along the Rio Grande, according to a person familiar with the discussions.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott spoke to President-elect Donald Trump's incoming \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, last week about using military resources to help transport migrants to the location and about building facilities, according to the person with knowledge of the discussions.",
      "In order to use the property, the incoming Trump administration could declare a national emergency, which would divert funds to build infrastructure and fund troops assigned to a border mission. The work could be done by the National Guard or active-duty military, the source said, and facilities could be soft-sided structures such as tents that could be quickly assembled.",
      "Abbott's press secretary, Andrew Mahaleris, did not respond to specific questions about the plot of land but said the governor's office is in \"regular communication with the incoming Trump Administration on effective strategies to secure the border.\"",
      "\"Texas has held the line against the Biden-Harris border crisis for the past four years, and the Governor looks forward to continuing to work closely with President Trump and Border Czar Homan to protect our state and the nation,\" Mahaleris said.",
      "The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump has promised to deport millions of immigrants who are in the country illegally. In order to make that possible, his incoming administration is looking to drastically expand the number of detention centers that would hold immigrants before they are sent out of the U.S.",
      "Texas Land Commissioner Dawn Buckingham bought the 1,402-acre plot of land on the Rio Grande for $3.8 million on Oct. 23 and offered to lease it to the incoming Trump administration as a location for mass deportation facilities, according to her office.",

      "A representative for the Starr County, Texas, permitting office said it has not received any new permitting applications for building structures on the property.",
      "Buckingham told NBC News affiliate\u00a0WOAI\u00a0last week that her agency also has additional plots of land around the state that could support the deportation effort.\u00a0Her office currently owns 13 million acres of land.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve identified some pieces that we think might be helpful to them, but of course we will partner with the Trump administration for whatever they need,\u201d Buckingham said.",
      "Buckingham said that in addition to the plot near the Rio Grande there could be urban locations as well. \u201cI think from the detention and deportation standpoint, we probably need some more urban pieces, which we do have,\u201d she said.",
      "In late October, Buckingham also purchased more than 350,000 acres near Big Bend National Park. That piece of land, called Brewster Ranch and located near the town of La Grulla, has some frontage on the Rio Grande and had been for sale for over a year.",
      "The seller was in talks with the Texas Parks and Wildlife, the National Park Service and national conservation organizations, but the Texas General Land Office was the only agency with the money to make it happen, according to James King, the broker for the property.",
      "King said the land was sold with no conservation restrictions by the seller.",
      "Judge Greg Henington, the top official in Brewster County, said the land is so vast that putting deportation facilities on the property would not make sense.\u00a0He said he believes the state intends to restore the land for eco-tourism.",
      "Kimberly Hubbard, spokesperson for the Texas General Land Office, confirmed that the land will most likely not be used to house immigrant detention centers.",
      "\"Although this piece of land has a border security component, it would not be a part of this initiative as the terrain wouldn\u2019t be suitable for this type of [deportation] facility,\" Hubbard said.\u00a0\"However, with that being said, Commissioner Buckingham is dedicated to working with the Trump Administration on gaining complete operational control of our southern border, and she\u2019s happy to serve as a good partner.\""

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Wednesday dove into the culture war issue of transgender rights as it weighs whether states can restrict gender transition care for minors.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his allies repeatedly pushed an anti-transgender rights message during the recently concluded election. Among other things, he has pledged to restrict access to gender-affirming health care and reimpose restrictions on transgender people serving in the military when he takes office in January.",
      "Democrats, including the Biden administration in the case now at the court, have sought to increase protections for transgender people.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority that includes three Trump appointees, is considering a challenge brought by the Biden administration and transgender teens and their families against a recently enacted law in Tennessee.",
      "Conservative justices questioned whether the issue involved evolving standards of care rather than strictly a medical regulation or a sex discrimination consideration as arguments began.",
      "Both Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito raised questions about changing views and increasing uncertainty among health authorities in Europe about some aspects of gender-affirming treatments.",
      "\"And of course, we're not the best situated to address issues like that,\" Roberts said, adding, \"Doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than trying to determine them for ourselves?\"",
      "Alito raised a question about the medical evidence for the efficacy of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, which the Biden administration has asserted is overwhelming.",
      "Given the determinations by British and Swedish health authorities that, broadly speaking, the benefits of the treatments for adolescents could outweigh the risks, he asked whether the administration stood by its argument that the medical approach was warranted for minors in general.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, acknowledged there is \"a lot of debate\" about the proper model of treatment and for whom and at what age it would help, but she argued there was a consensus that the care can be medically necessary for some adolescents.",
      "She pointed out that the United Kingdom and Sweden have not  banned such treatments, \"and I think that's because of the recognition that this care can provide critical, sometimes life-saving, benefits for individuals with severe gender dysphoria,\" referring to the clinical term given to the distress people can experience when their gender identities are in conflict with the genders assigned to them at birth.",
      "The oral argument Wednesday morning is the most significant so far of the court's latest term, which started in October and ends in June.",
      "There was a boisterous scene with supporters on both sides outside the court ahead of arguments. \"Every child deserves the chance to fly as their true self,\" one sign held by a pro-transgender rights attendee said. \"Stop transing kids\u201d said another held by a woman supporting the state's law.",
      "The state measure enacted in 2023 bars gender transition surgery for minors as well as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The surgery ban is not at issue in the Supreme Court case after a lower court judge said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge it.",
      "No matter how the court rules, it will have a broad impact, as more than 20 other states have passed laws similar to Tennessee's.",
      "\"Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,\" Nashville-based Brian Williams, the father of a 16-year-old transgender girl who is one of the plaintiffs in the case, said on a call with reporters.",
      "He recounted how L.W., as his daughter is named in court papers, had \"shared openly and honesty the pain she was in not being able to live as the girl she truly is.\"",
      "L.W. started taking puberty blockers at 13, and hormone therapy a year later.",
      "\"Today she is happy and healthy, a 16-year-old planning for her future,\" Williams said. But as a result of the ban, the family will now be forced to travel out of state to get necessary treatment, he added.",
      "The challengers argue that the Tennessee law is a form of sex discrimination, violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which requires equal treatment under the law. They say the law discriminates against transgender patients because there are other circumstances in which non-transgender patients can be treated with puberty blockers and hormone therapy for other reasons.",
      "Among other things, Prelogar said in court papers that laws targeting transgender people should be considered by courts under a strict standard called \"heightened scrutiny.\" If the court were to adopt that approach, it would make it easier for legal challenges against restrictions affecting transgender people to succeed.",
      "Prelogar also frequently referred to the court's surprise 6-3 ruling in 2020\u00a0written by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. He concluded that federal law that bars sex discrimination in employment protected transgender and gay people, a ruling that angered conservatives.",
      "In defending the Tennessee law, the state's attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, emphasized in court papers the rapid change in approach on how to treat minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Skrmetti pushed back against the Biden administration's efforts to intervene and prevent states from acting on the issue.",
      "\"While the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\" Skrmetti wrote.",
      "The state also argues that the law does not constitute sex discrimination, saying it is merely a form of medical regulation that applies equally to everyone.",
      "Major medical organizations say gender-affirming treatments are an effective way to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, whose state has a similar ban to Tennessee's, is one conservative figure who has questioned those findings. He filed a brief describing what he called a \"medical, legal and political scandal\" led by activists to influence medical experts to help them win in court.",
      "Like some justices did during arguments Wednesday, those who back state restrictions have pointed to how some other countries that previously pioneered transition treatments for minors, including the United Kingdom and Sweden, have since revised their approach and tightened standards.",
      "In a related case that could indicate where the justices are leaning, the Supreme Court in April allowed Idaho to mostly enforce a similar law. The court\u2019s three liberal justices dissented.",
      "The case being argued Wednesday reached the Supreme Court after the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling last year rejecting challenges to the Tennessee law and a similar measure in Kentucky. A district court judge had blocked the law, but the appeals court allowed it to go into effect.",
      "One potential wrinkle in the Tennessee case is that the incoming Trump administration could change the federal government's position in the case and come out in favor of the state's law before the court rules. Such a move might not, however, have any impact on how the case is decided. A ruling is expected by the end of June."

    "story": [
      "A 23-year-old Italian man has been sentenced to life in prison after admitting to stabbing his ex-girlfriend in a closely watched case that sparked public outcry and revived the debate over violence against women in the country.",
      "A court in Venice on Tuesday convicted Filippo Turetta in the murder of 22-year-old Guilia Cecchettin in November 2023, shortly after she broke up with him and one week before she was due to graduate from the University of Padua.",
      "The court heard that Turetta stabbed the biomedical engineering student 70 times before stuffing her body into garbage bags and discarding it at the bottom of a ditch. He then fled to Germany, where he was arrested after her body was discovered seven days later.",
      "Turetta, who admitted to killing Cecchettin but denied it was premeditated, was also found guilty of illegal possession of weapons, kidnapping and concealment of a corpse. He was also ordered to pay damages to Cecchettin\u2019s family and cover their legal fees.",
      "Cecchettin\u2019s murder was one of more than 100 cases of femicide in Italy last year, primarily at the hands of family members or romantic partners.",
      "The student\u2019s death gripped the nation after details emerged about Turetta\u2019s possessive nature and Cecchettin\u2019s attempts to end the relationship. More than 10,000 people attended her funeral last December.",
      "To raise awareness of domestic violence, Cecchettin\u2019s family released a list written by her a few months before her death titled \u201c15 reasons I had to break up with him.\u201d",
      "In it, she cited requirements for her to help him study and noted that he would complain if she didn't send him enough emojis. In an 80-page statement written from jail in childlike handwriting, Turetta also acknowledged that he could not accept any outcome other than getting back with her.",
      "However, it was emotional comments from Cecchettin\u2019s sister, Elena Cecchettin, that prompted a political furor and reignited public debate over patriarchy and gender roles in Italian society.",
      "In an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Elena wrote that Turetta was not \u201ca monster\u201d but rather the \u201chealthy son of a patriarchal society.\u201d",
      "\u201cA monster is an exception, a person external to society, a person for whom society should not take responsibility.\u00a0And instead the responsibility exists,\u201d she wrote in November 2023, according to a Google translation.",
      "The far-right government was lambasted by Cecchettin\u2019s family and opposition parties after Minister of Education Giuseppe Valditara argued last month that the patriarchy no longer exists in Italy and that the rise in sexual violence was instead linked to illegal immigration.",
      "He was speaking at the\u00a0launch of a foundation established by Cecchettin's father in memory of his daughter.",
      "The Italian government did not immediately respond to NBC\u2019s request for comment on the remarks.",
      "In the wake of Cecchettin\u2019s death, the Italian Senate last year approved new measures aimed at addressing violence against women, including stricter restraining orders and heightened surveillance of men found guilty of gender-based violence.",
      "Still, nongovernment organizations and opposition politicians believe the measures do not go far enough and are demanding that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni take further steps to combat gender inequality and reduce crime against women in the country."

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 15:38:53 GMT",
    "summary": "Washington, D.C.\u2019s attorney general sued Amazon on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation\u2019s capital from access to Prime\u2019s high-speed delivery.",
    "story": [
      "Washington, D.C.\u2019s attorney general sued\u00a0Amazon\u00a0on Wednesday, accusing the company of covertly depriving residents in certain ZIP codes in the nation\u2019s capital from access to Prime\u2019s high-speed delivery.",
      "The lawsuit from AG Brian Schwalb alleges that, since 2022, Amazon has \u201csecretly excluded\u201d two \u201chistorically underserved\u201d D.C. ZIP codes from its expedited delivery service while charging Prime members living there the full subscription price. Amazon\u2019s Prime membership program costs $139 a year and includes perks like two-day shipping and access to streaming content.",
      "\u201cAmazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,\u201d Schwalb said in a statement. \u201cWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one zip code is worth less than a dollar in another.\u201d",
      "Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said in a statement it\u2019s \u201ccategorically false\u201d that its business practices are \u201cdiscriminatory or deceptive.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every zip code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,\u201d Kelly said in a statement. \u201cIn the zip codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\u201d",
      "Kelly said Amazon has offered to work with the AG\u2019s office on efforts \u201cto reduce crime and improve safety in these areas.\u201d",
      "In June 2022, Amazon allegedly stopped using its own delivery trucks to shuttle packages in the ZIP codes 20019 and 20020 based on concerns over driver safety, the suit states. In place of its in-house delivery network, the company relied on outside carriers like\u00a0UPS\u00a0and the U.S. Postal Service to make deliveries, according to the complaint, which was filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The decision caused residents in those ZIP codes to experience \u201csignificantly longer delivery times than their neighbors in other District ZIP codes, despite paying the exact same membership price for Prime,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Data from the AG shows that before Amazon instituted the change, more than 72% of Prime packages in the two ZIP codes were delivered within two days of checkout. That number dropped to as low as 24% following the move, while two-day delivery rates across the district increased to 74%.",
      "Amazon has faced prior complaints of disparities in its Prime program. In 2016, the company\u00a0said it would expand\u00a0access to same-day delivery in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Washington, after\u00a0a Bloomberg investigation\u00a0found Black residents were \u201cabout half as likely\u201d to be eligible for same-day delivery as white residents.",
      "The ZIP codes in Schwalb\u2019s complaint are in areas with large Black populations, according to 2022 Census data based on its American Community Survey.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission\u00a0also sued Amazon in June 2023, accusing the company of tricking consumers into signing up for Prime and \u201csabotaging\u201d their attempts to cancel by employing so-called dark patterns, or deceptive design tactics meant to steer users toward a specific choice. Amazon said the complaint was \u201cfalse on the facts and the law.\u201d The case is set to go to trial in June 2025.",
      "According to Scwalb\u2019s complaint, Amazon never communicated the delivery exclusion to Prime members in the area. When consumers in the affected ZIP codes complained to Amazon about slower delivery speeds, the company said it was due to circumstances outside its control, the suit says.",
      "The lawsuit accuses Amazon of violating the district\u2019s consumer protection laws. It also asks the court to \u201cput an end to Amazon\u2019s deceptive conduct,\u201d as well as for damages and penalties.",
      "To get packages to customers\u2019 doorsteps, Amazon uses a combination of its own contracted delivery companies, usually distinguishable by Amazon-branded cargo vans, as well as carriers like USPS, UPS and\u00a0FedEx, and a network of gig workers who make deliveries from their own vehicles as part of its Flex program.",
      "Amazon has rapidly expanded its in-house logistics army in recent years as it looks to speed up deliveries from two days to one day or even a few hours. In July, the company\u00a0said\u00a0it recorded its \u201cfastest Prime delivery speeds ever\u201d in the first half of the year, delivering more than 5 billion items within a day.",
      "In relying on its own workforce, Amazon has assumed greater control over its delivery operations.",
      "In his complaint, Schwalb cites an internal company policy that says Amazon may choose to exclude certain areas from being served by its in-house delivery network if a driver experiences \u201cviolence, intimidation or harassment.\u201d The company relies on UPS or USPS to deliver packages in excluded areas.",

    "story": [
      "The mother of Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, pleaded her son's case Wednesday as his future nomination appeared to be in jeopardy in the Senate over allegations involving drinking and sexual assault.",
      "In an interview on Fox News' \"Fox and Friends,\" Penelope Hegseth addressed an email that she wrote to her son in 2018, whose details were published by The New York Times last week, that accused him of mistreating women for years.",
      "\"I wrote that in haste. I wrote that with deep emotions. I wrote that as a parent,\" she told the network, explaining that it was during a time when Pete Hegseth was \"going through a very difficult divorce.\"",
      "\"I wrote that out of love,\" she continued. \"And about two hours later, I retracted it with an apology, but nobody's seen that.\"",
      "Penelope Hegseth told the Times later that she regretted the email, which NBC News has not obtained. She also told the newspaper that she immediately apologized to Hegseth for sending it and that she said her statements in the email were not true.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s lawyer declined to provide a statement but passed along one from the Trump transition team that said: \u201cIt is shameful but not surprising that the NYT is publishing a story about one out of context snippet from an illegally obtained private conversation between a mother and her son. The entire purpose of this exercise is to malign Mr. Hegseth.\u201d",
      "Hegseth has denied that he mistreated women and an allegation of sexual assault in 2017, saying the encounter was consensual; he later reached an undisclosed settlement with his accuser. Hegseth also did not respond Tuesday evening to questions about the drinking allegations.",
      "On Wednesday, Hegseth vowed in a post to X that he would not end his bid to be Trump's secretary of defense, saying, \"The Left is afraid of disrupters and change agents. They are afraid of @realDonaldTrump\u2014and me. So they smear w/ fake, anonymous sources & BS stories. They don\u2019t want truth.",
      "\"Our warriors never back down, & neither will I.\u201d",
      "Asked on \"Fox and Friends\" about the allegations of sexual assault, excessive alcohol use, infidelity and financial mismanagement, Penelope Hegseth said, \"Our job as parents [is] to correct. They are to speak truth, and I am a passionate person like Pete, and sometimes emotional words come out. I don\u2019t believe any of that is true \u2014\u00a0any of it.\"",
      "\"He doesn\u2019t misuse women, no. He\u2019s been through some difficult things,\" she added. \"I\u2019m not going to list them by name, but I would just say that some of those, some of those attachments or descriptions, are just not true, especially anymore.\"",
      "She said she wants people to judge her son for who he is today and not what he may have been like seven years ago, saying most of the reports are \"misinformation.\"",
      "\"Pete is a new person. He\u2019s redeemed, forgiven, changed. I think we all are after seven years,\" she said, again calling her son a \"changed man.\"",
      "Penelope Hegseth also said she believes her son is qualified to be secretary of defense, adding that his work as a TV host on Fox News has prepared him for the job, teaching him to be a good communicator who can think on his feet and take charge.",
      "Asked if she thinks the negative reports about her son have become a distraction for the beginning of Trump's second term, she said, \"To a degree, but I think it can be overcome.\""

      "A cast member since the show\u2019s first season, Colby Mayfield (Denim Richards) has been a regular ranch hand for the Duttons. We\u2019ve watched him play poker with the guys, develop a romance with one of the few female hands (Teeter, played by Jennifer Landon), get trampled by a horse while skinny-dipping, and overall be a solid, reliable character.

His laughter, camaraderie, and bravery brought warmth to the cold, unforgiving world of the ranch, and his departure has left an undeniable void,\" the comment read, and said later, \"Colby\u2019s journey may have come to an end, but the legacy he leaves behind will echo through the valleys of Yellowstone for seasons to come. As we say goodbye to Colby, we carry with us the lessons of loyalty, love, and resilience.\"",

      "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly published the day after the episode aired, Richards shared his own take on his character's death, saying the season is \"really emphasizing the realities of cowboy life.\"",
      "\"We have this saying that everyone\u2019s going to fall off a horse at some point in their life. It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s just when and how bad. That is not a phenomenon. These things do happen, so I do think that there\u2019s that element where I think it is about really wanting to emphasize that this is a reality,\" he said.",

      "This sounds insane. My album title is a little bit insane, but we love the sparklemuffin.",
      "I feel like I probably relate to \"Big Love\" right now the most. It's this big, kind of explosive song about, a search for love, or feeling this like huge, sort of like, biblical love.",
      "I think, you know, just being with my daughter in the last six months, I really feel kind of like, heart explosion. So I would say \"Big Love.\"",

      "I think playing Karen in \"Daisy Jones & The Six\" had such an impact on me. I was playing a character that was so confident, that was part of a band, part of a unit.",
      "I knew I was going to be hanging out at Sound City Studios all the time. So I think acting in that, and putting myself in her shoes, and she's so brave and strong, you take on the character sometimes. I think it helped me get over a lot of my own insecurities, and made me kind of feel like I could go and make my record.",

      "I would say singing, but please don't  ruin my chance at getting an acting job.",
      "Oh, that's another really hard one. I mean, London's like my hometown. London's my heart, so I'd say London.",
      "Sneakers, that's not even hard. I can barely walk in heels at all. I'm constantly uncomfortable, so I can't wait to get back into sneakers immediately."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 19:01:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Marissa Bode slammed negative comments made about her \"Wicked\" character Nessarose's disability on social emdia.",
    "story": [
      "Marissa Bode is addressing the derogatory comments made about her \u201cWicked\u201d character.",
      "Bode, who portrays the character Nessarose, the younger sister of Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Elphaba, posted a five-minute long video to her TikTok slamming the slew of negative comments she\u2019s received since the film premiered on Nov. 22.",
      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",
      "Bode then implored those listening not to dismiss the feelings of others, but rather \u201clisten to the people or to the person that it is affecting and how it makes them feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message with a lesson she learned from \u201cWicked,\u201d adding, \u201cLastly, I want to say one of the major themes within \u2018Wicked\u2019 is having the ability to listen and to understand one another, and I truly hope that is something a lot of you can practice more and take with you.\u201d",
      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",
      "Before landing the role of Nessarose, she worked as an after-school art teacher and mentor, telling TODAY.com that she felt \u201cbeyond privileged and lucky\u201d to be cast in \u201cWicked\u201d one year after she graduated from college. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not represented a lot and you don\u2019t see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",
      "Bode is the first-ever physically disabled actor to take on the role of Nessarose, sharing that she was \u201cover the moon\u201d about the casting decision.",
      "She explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "While the rest of the world was waiting to see if Taylor Swift would make it to the Super Bowl in Las Vegas from her \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Tokyo to watch Travis Kelce, two women were invested in this year\u2019s game for a different reason.",
      "On Super Bowl Sunday, Samantha DiPippo,\u00a0Hallmark\u2019s senior vice president for programming, was at a watch party texting friends and fellow Hallmark executives.",
      "Their eyes were on the Kansas City Chiefs, a centerpiece of the NFL season if not for a star player\u2019s new courtship with the world\u2019s biggest pop performer, then for entering their fourth Super Bowl in five seasons. Those folks at Hallmark, a mainstay for romance lovers, had some ideas. Could another Lombardi Trophy for the Chiefs help bring those ideas to fruition?",
      "They were about to see \u2014 and the game was a nail-biter. The San Francisco 49ers held on to an early lead, 10-3, going into halftime. After Kansas City pulled ahead in the third quarter, the score was tied 19-19 by the fourth, sending the championship game into overtime.",
      "DiPippo\u2019s phone was blowing up with messages from her team. Then, thanks to the \u201cpower of the Chiefs,\u201d and, she says, \u201ca little bit of magic,\u201d Kansas City won 25-22 after a touchdown pass from quarterback Patrick Mahomes to wide receiver Mecole Hardman.",
      "\u201cCandice (DiLavore, senior manager at Hallmark) and I are just texting back and forth thinking, \u2018I hope this happens. I hope this happens,\u2019\u201d DiPippo recalls.",
      "\u201cAs it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "The answer to that question became a resounding yes. That movie is Hallmark\u2019s \u201cHoliday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story,\u201d premiering Saturday, Nov. 30. The movie airs at 8 p.m. ET on Hallmark Channel.",
      "The film was shot over a period of about 15 days on location in Kansas City, including three days at Arrowhead Stadium.",
      "As it got closer and closer, I was like, \u2018Are we making a movie?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hallmark executive Samantha DiPippo",
      "TODAY visited the set of the film in July to meet the stars and see Jenna Bush Hager make her film debut with a cameo. This was all while witnessing firsthand the hundreds of extras, dozens of Christmas trees and four football fields worth of lights to make, in the words of DiPippo, \u201cthe largest movie that Hallmark Channel\u2019s ever done.\u201d",
      "A match made in Hallmark heaven",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was announced in June as part of Hallmark\u2019s 2024 \u201cCountdown to Christmas\u201d lineup, which included a new partnership between the Chiefs and Hallmark.",
      "You\u2019re forgiven if you thought this movie would follow the true-to-life plot laid out by Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s romance, though.",
      "For the uninitiated, the Swift-Kelce timeline looks like this: In September 2023, Swift attended a Chiefs home game after rumors that Swift and tight end Travis Kelce were an item. Kelce notably had attended her \u201cEras Tour\u201d show in Kansas City just months before, and after the concert, used his podcast to tell the world that he tried (and failed) to give Swift his number.",
      "The rest, as many know, is history.",
      "Though Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce\u2019s story produced an audience with an appetite for more football romance, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d isn\u2019t about a player and a pop star (Lifetime has that movie, and it's full of references to Swift); this follows a Chiefs employee and an NFL super fan.",
      "The screenwriter of \u201cHoliday Touchdown,\u201d Julie Sherman Wolfe, who\u2019s written more than 20 films for Hallmark, says she\u2019s always wanted to write \u201ca big football movie.\u201d The offer for this project came just a week after the Super Bowl, when her team, the 49ers, experienced that crushing defeat.",
      "When tackling the script, Wolfe says she leaned into her own family\u2019s unique superstitions and traditions.",
      "\u201cIt really was coming from a place in my heart about what we love the most about the game. I guess I would love people to know that you don\u2019t have to be a Chiefs fan to enjoy this movie,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThe Chiefs are in the movie, and it is about them, but it\u2019s about more than that. It\u2019s about things that are bigger than a team. It\u2019s about your team.\u201d",
      "\u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d first introduces Alana (Hunter King) and her family of Chiefs super fans who run a merch store. In comes Derrick (Tyler Hynes), who\u2019s in charge of fan engagement for the Chiefs and oversees the annual fan of the year contest (which is real, by the way). Alana\u2019s family is, of course, in the running.",
      "Though Wolfe says one doesn\u2019t have to love the Chiefs to appreciate the movie, its cameos will elate those who do: NFL mom Donna Kelce, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid and players Mecole Hardman, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and George Karlaftis all appear.",
      "The film even took inspiration from a real job in the Chiefs org. Jayne Martin has been the vice president of fan experience for 23 seasons. She says she is \u201cbridging the gap between the team and our fans.\u201d",
      "In March, Wolfe spoke with Martin to go over the premise of the storyline. They touched on Martin\u2019s job responsibilities and walked through potential scenarios that the film\u2019s leading man might encounter.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for (Wolfe) to ensure that the narrative was realistic,\u201d Martin says.",
      "Wolfe also brought aspects of her own football fandom to the plot. Alana\u2019s last name, Higman, came from her friend\u2019s maiden name, in honor of her family of Chiefs fans. Derrick\u2019s last name meanwhile is Young \u2014 a nod to the Chiefs\u2019 Super Bowl competitors.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s for Steve Young from the 49ers,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cI had to put something in there.\u201d",
      "Then there\u2019s the Higmans\u2019 lucky Chiefs hat, which drives a subplot. Alana\u2019s family has a superstition: The Chiefs only go to the Super Bowl when that old beanie is worn by a family member on Christmas. Derrick doesn\u2019t believe it though \u2014 so when the hat goes missing, things go awry.",
      "Originally, Wolfe\u2019s draft referenced a vintage Chiefs baseball hat. After they sent a couple pages of the script to the Chiefs, DiPippo recalls one of the team\u2019s executives saying, \u201cI\u2019m reading this, and I\u2019m just thinking of my grandpa. My grandfather had a vintage Chiefs winter hat, and he would wear it all the time while he was shoveling snow, and that\u2019s my memory of him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m reading it, I\u2019m in my kitchen crying, and I text one of our other execs, and I said, \u2018It\u2019s a winter hat now, it\u2019s a winter hat now!\u2019\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "The Taylor Swift of it all",
      "It\u2019s undeniable that NFL experienced in 2023 season what has been dubbed the \u201cTaylor Swift effect,\u201d or the increase in exposure and female audience that follows the famous singer.",
      "\u201cThe magic, the romance of the Taylor Swift and Kelce union really got people in that romance mood \u2014 and romance plus football, right?\u201d Wolfe says.",
      "Exactly. For Hallmark, project ideas really started flowing in December 2023, after a pair of commercials leaned into just that.",
      "The first was a Hallmark ad, which aired Christmas Day on ESPN and stars Wolfe herself. In it, she sits at her computer as if typing a screenplay and lists the many ways the 2023 NFL season played out like a Hallmark movie, from \u201cincredible stories\u201d to \u201cunexpected romance.\u201d",
      "Then in January, the Chiefs released a postseason commercial titled \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which is framed as a spoof trailer for a Hallmark-esque film about a diehard NFL fan who works at a Chiefs gift shop. (Sound familiar?) Hynes plays that fan, and Donna Kelce notably makes a cameo.",
      "DiPippo says the ESPN ad was a \u201cgreat catalyst\u201d to \u201cHoliday Touchdown.\u201d Then \u201cFalling for Football,\u201d which she calls a \u201clittle bit of a love letter to Hallmark,\u201d helped inspire the premise of the movie.",
      "Hynes says that when the Chiefs approached him for the \u201cFalling for Football\u201d commercial, it felt a little more \u201ctongue in cheek.\u201d But starring in \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d required him to treat the type of film spoofed in the commercial with integrity.",
      "\u201cThis is a legitimate Hallmark movie that is filled with all the heart, sincerity, warmth and joy that these movies always have,\u201d says Hynes, who has been in more than 15 Hallmark films, including six in the 2024 season.",
      "Martin says Chiefs fan demographics have changed since Swift first appeared at Arrowhead Stadium and is now about 57% female. \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d is an example of an attempt to reach and engage that new audience with the Chiefs and the NFL as a whole, Martin says.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened.\u201d",
      "Screenwriter Julie Sherman Wolfe",
      "Though DiPippo believes Hallmark\u2019s partnership with the Chiefs could have happened without Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s 100% a pure Hallmark movie at heart,\u201d she says \u2014 Wolfe believes\u00a0a little of fate was still at play.",
      "\u201cI honestly feel like everything about this movie was meant to happen when it happened. It was meant to be,\u201d Wolfe says. \u201cThey got the right people and the right time and Travis and Taylor, and everything happened the way it was meant to happen for this movie.\u201d",
      "While appearing on TODAY Nov. 27, Hynes said it's \"impossible\" for the Swift-Kelce inspiration \"to not find its way into the movie.\"",
      "\"We're telling a multigenerational family story,\" he said. \"It feels like something quintessentially Hallmark while still servicing the people who want to see a big football movie.\"",
      "Christmas in July",
      "While \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d strays from Kelce and Swift's relationship, being part of the film is surreal for star Hunter King, who identifies as a Swiftie and has her own \u201cinvisible string\u201d connection to it all.",
      "Kelce and Swift\u2019s storybook romance notably started after he attended an \u201cEras Tour\u201d concert in Kansas City. On July 7, King attended a Kansas City show with her sister, actor Joey King, who appeared in Swift\u2019s \u201cMean\u201d music video in 2011, then in \u201cI Can See You\u201d almost 13 years later. At that July 7 concert, Joey King joined Swift onstage.",
      "\u201cThe day that we started filming I think was almost exactly a year later,\u201d Hunter King says. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Wait a second. It really is a full circle moment for me.\u2019\u201d",
      "The production kicked off shrouded in secrecy. Casting was \u201cincredibly difficult,\u201d DiPippo says, because they couldn\u2019t share many details about the project, and \u201ceverything had NDAs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the most secretive we\u2019ve ever had to be on any project,\u201d DiPippo says.",
      "So when production started up around Kansas City in July, it drew a crowd. In addition to Arrowhead Stadium, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u201d was filmed in the suburb of Independence, Missouri. The local pizzeria Square Pizza was transformed into a fictional barbecue restaurant called Norma & Nic\u2019s, managed by Donna Kelce\u2019s character. Inside, garlands with red ornaments bordered the ordering counter. Chiefs memorabilia hung on the walls, and wreaths decorated every door.",
      "The entire production involved about two dozen Christmas trees used in rotation \u2014 including 18 used in one day \u2014 as well as more than 400 yards of lights of \u201cevery color ornament bulb you can imagine,\u201d according to Daniel King, \u201cHoliday Touchdown\u2019s\u201d production designer.",
      "Most behind the scenes were met with challenges, like set decorator Christi Whiteley, who was in charge of decorating and re-decorating up to 20 trees over the course of a few days, and property master Hunter Nelson, who made sure edible props like holiday meals and gingerbread houses were preserved at certain temperatures.",
      "And speaking of temperatures \u2014 the July heat was a hurdle for everyone.",
      "At Arrowhead, about 1,000 extras filmed inside the stadium, wearing parkas, scarves and other winter gear as the temperature reached 99 degrees, though felt more like 102, according to the Weather app.",
      "Hunter King filmed the Arrowhead Stadium scenes with an ice pack in her pants, a neck fan and an undershirt fan. On a discomfort scale of 1 to 10, Hunter King says filming in the sun felt like a 9.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s mostly the sweaters and then the coat over it, and in this heat and in the humidity, that\u2019s what really, really cranks it up a notch,\u201d she says.",

      "BEIRUT \u2014 Iran has thrown its support behind Syria's government after thousands of insurgents took control of the country's second-largest city of Aleppo and seized nearby towns and villages in a swift and surprise offensive.",
      "\u201cWe firmly support the Syrian army and government,\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was quoted as saying by the state-run IRNA news agency, before he set off for Syria\u2019s capital Damascus on Sunday. \u201cThe Syrian army will once again be victorious over these terrorist groups as in the past,\u201d he added.",
      "His comments came after the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based war monitor, reported that insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham had seized control of Aleppo International Airport.",
      "The Observatory said that fighters from the group posted pictures from the airport that would mean it\u2019s the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. The rebels now control \u201cthe majority of\u201d Aleppo after forcing the governor, police and security branches to retreat from the city center, it added.",
      "Russian and Syrian jets responded by striking the rebel-held city of Idlib on Sunday, according to the Observatory and the Syrian state-run news network Al-Ikhbariyah, in a second day of intensive bombing aimed at pushing back the insurgents.",
      "At least 347 fatalities, including 40 civilians, have been reported during the clashes, according to the war monitoring group, which relies on a network of on-the-ground information sources. Five children and three women were among the civilians killed by bombardment and airstrikes, it added.",
      "National security adviser Jake Sullivan told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the U.S. has designated Hayat Tahrir al-Sham a \u201cterrorist enemy, so we have concerns, obviously, about that group.\u201d He also called for \u201cthe full implementation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that can bring a measure of peace and stability to Syria.\u201d",
      "The fighting further exacerbates Syria\u2019s humanitarian crisis, already one of the world\u2019s worst after 13 years of civil war, which began in 2011 as a protest movement against Assad\u2019s authoritarian rule but has since killed an estimated half-million people.",
      "The offensive raises questions about the preparedness of Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s armed forces. In his first public comments released by the state news agency Saturday evening, Assad said Syria will continue to \u201cdefend its stability and territorial integrity against terrorists and their supporters.\u201d Syria is able to defeat them no matter how much their attacks intensify, he added.",
      "The Observatory reported Sunday that his forces were sending \u201clarge reinforcements and drawing a defensive line around several cities and villages\u201d in the Hama Governorate, which sits to the south of Aleppo.",
      "Iran\u2019s renewed commitment to Assad underscores the geopolitical stakes in the conflict and exposes a complex web of rivalries, factions and foreign interventions that ensure Syria\u2019s turmoil persists.",
      "While Assad controls roughly 70% of Syrian territory, the remaining areas are held by a mix of opposition groups, Kurdish forces and countries like the U.S. and Turkey.",
      "Tehran sees Syria as a critical part of its regional strategy, providing a land corridor to Hezbollah in Lebanon and a front against Israeli influence.",
      "Iran\u2019s support for Assad mirrors that of Russia, which helped to turn the tide of the war during 2016\u2019s battle for Aleppo between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters. The victory helped Assad to secure his hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",
      "Moscow\u2019s intervention also secured its military presence in Syria, including the naval base at Tartus, while bolstering Assad\u2019s grip on power.",
      "A main backer of Syrian opposition groups, Turkey said in recent weeks its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas. These were in violation of a de-escalation agreement it sponsored along with Russia and Iran.",
      "However, its primary focus is undermining Kurdish-backed rebel groups near its borders. Ankara has said Syrian Kurdish fighters are an extension of the separatist Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since the 1980s \u2014 a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people.",
      "The U.S., for its part, opposes Assad, opposes Russia and opposes Iran, but has allied itself with Syrian Kurdish forces despite their fight against the United States\u2019 NATO ally Turkey.",
      "Sullivan said it was \u201cno surprise\u201d that rebels have tried to take advantage of the main players backing the Syrian government, because Iran, Russian and Hezbollah have been distracted by other conflicts.",
      "Inside Aleppo, schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station, although bakeries were open.",
      "The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday that Aleppo\u2019s two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients, while many private facilities were closed.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

      "A 23-year-old Italian man has been sentenced to life in prison after admitting to stabbing his ex-girlfriend in a closely watched case that sparked public outcry and revived the debate over violence against women in the country.",
      "A court in Venice on Tuesday convicted Filippo Turetta in the murder of 22-year-old Guilia Cecchettin in November 2023, shortly after she broke up with him and one week before she was due to graduate from the University of Padua.",
      "The court heard that Turetta stabbed the biomedical engineering student 70 times before stuffing her body into garbage bags and discarding it at the bottom of a ditch. He then fled to Germany, where he was arrested after her body was discovered seven days later.",
      "Turetta, who admitted to killing Cecchettin but denied it was premeditated, was also found guilty of illegal possession of weapons, kidnapping and concealment of a corpse. He was also ordered to pay damages to Cecchettin\u2019s family and cover their legal fees.",
      "Cecchettin\u2019s murder was one of more than 100 cases of femicide in Italy last year, primarily at the hands of family members or romantic partners.",
      "The student\u2019s death gripped the nation after details emerged about Turetta\u2019s possessive nature and Cecchettin\u2019s attempts to end the relationship. More than 10,000 people attended her funeral last December.",
      "To raise awareness of domestic violence, Cecchettin\u2019s family released a list written by her a few months before her death titled \u201c15 reasons I had to break up with him.\u201d",
      "In it, she cited requirements for her to help him study and noted that he would complain if she didn't send him enough emojis. In an 80-page statement written from jail in childlike handwriting, Turetta also acknowledged that he could not accept any outcome other than getting back with her.",
      "However, it was emotional comments from Cecchettin\u2019s sister, Elena Cecchettin, that prompted a political furor and reignited public debate over patriarchy and gender roles in Italian society.",
      "In an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Elena wrote that Turetta was not \u201ca monster\u201d but rather the \u201chealthy son of a patriarchal society.\u201d",
      "\u201cA monster is an exception, a person external to society, a person for whom society should not take responsibility.\u00a0And instead the responsibility exists,\u201d she wrote in November 2023, according to a Google translation.",
      "The far-right government was lambasted by Cecchettin\u2019s family and opposition parties after Minister of Education Giuseppe Valditara argued last month that the patriarchy no longer exists in Italy and that the rise in sexual violence was instead linked to illegal immigration.",
      "He was speaking at the\u00a0launch of a foundation established by Cecchettin's father in memory of his daughter.",
      "The Italian government did not immediately respond to NBC\u2019s request for comment on the remarks.",
      "In the wake of Cecchettin\u2019s death, the Italian Senate last year approved new measures aimed at addressing violence against women, including stricter restraining orders and heightened surveillance of men found guilty of gender-based violence.",
      "Still, nongovernment organizations and opposition politicians believe the measures do not go far enough and are demanding that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni take further steps to combat gender inequality and reduce crime against women in the country."

      "But his fragile parliamentary coalition could be toppled by an unlikely combination of far-right and leftist opponents Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe country is at a turning point,\u201d Finance Minister Antoine Armand told French television Tuesday, urging its politicians \u201cnot to plunge the country into uncertainty.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest chapter in the political instability roiling France and Europe as a whole, where far-right populists and nationalists \u2014 many of them allies of American President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 are capitalizing on public discontent about rising prices and immigration, and challenging mainstream political parties.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Why the French furor?",
      "Macron\u2019s center-right prime minister, Michel Barnier, is facing a no-confidence vote tabled by far-right leader Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party. The left-wing New Popular Front coalition has also filed a similar motion, teeing up a debate and vote in the National Assembly starting 4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET).",
      "Barnier, who was appointed by Macron in September, told French TV Tuesday that it was \u201cpossible\u201d he could survive. But the math does not look good for him.",
      "Only 289 votes from the 577 lawmakers will be needed to secure his ouster and the far-right and leftist factions number more than 320.",
      "If the government falls, it would be the shortest lived in France\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cFrance is currently looking ungovernable,\u201d said Rainbow Murray, a professor specializing in French politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cEven if this government falls and is replaced by another, there\u2019s no guarantee that a new one will fare any better.\u201d",
      "The main disagreement centers over Barnier\u2019s attempts to rein in France\u2019s soaring budget deficit. After France spent billions during the pandemic, Barnier wants to cut 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raise taxes by 20 billion euros.",
      "France\u2019s deficit is currently projected to hit 6.1% of GDP, far higher than than the European Union requirement of 3% or lower. The looming economic and political crises has spooked markets, with French borrowing costs briefly rising above those of Greece on Monday.",
      "Without\u00a0a majority in France\u2019s lower house, Barnier\u00a0has told lawmakers he plans to use Article 49.3 of the French Constitution \u2014 often referred to as a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatum.",
      "This means he can pass legislation without a vote, but his opponents can table votes of no confidence against him if they wish and this time they have.",
      "A divided legislature",
      "After Macron stunned Europe by calling snap parliamentary elections in June, Le Pen was only blocked from power by Macron\u2019s centrists and their left-wing opponents working together tactically.",
      "The upshot was a legislature divided between left, center and far-right \u2014 with none holding enough power to govern securely alone.",
      "\u201cThese are three political groups that can\u2019t work together and it\u2019s been impossible to find a consensus,\u201d said Murray.",
      "Macron shunned the leftists, who won the most seats without securing a majority, and instead tapped Barnier, who was able to cobble together enough conservatives and centrists to govern without an absolute majority.",
      "While the outraged left have regularly voted against him, Barnier has been able to work with the far-right by making policy concessions on issues such as crime and immigration. But Le Pen says the budget cuts and tax rises are \u201cred lines\u201d she will not cross.",
      "\u201cWe said what were the nonnegotiable elements for us,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cWe are straight in our political approach. We defend the French people.\u201d",
      "This creates a huge headache for Macron, who is responsible for appointing prime ministers to be approved by parliament. But he cannot dissolve the parliament again until 2025, meaning he has to work with what he\u2019s got.",
      "While he could try to bring Barnier back in, appoint a successor or an apolitical government of technocrats, all would be vulnerable to dethroning by the far-right.",
      "If Macron \u201ccannot get a government together with the support of a majority in parliament, he is going out and going to come under increasing pressure to resign,\u201d said Douglas Webber, an emeritus professor at the INSEAD business school, based in Paris.",

      "The continent\u2019s other powerhouse, Germany, is also in crisis. Its left-wing coalition collapsed in November and the far-right Alternative for Germany is polling in second place ahead of February elections.",
      "The far right have also made gains in the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and elsewhere. Many of them have welcomed Trump\u2019s election to a second term, setting up the prospect of a transatlantic alliance between these bedfellow forces that were recently regarded as a political fringe.",
      "\u201cThere is a hollow core at the heart of Europe because the Franco-German engine, which is supposed to keep the E.U. ticking over and on the rails, is now derailed,\u201d Webber said. \u201cThere is a kind of vacuum at the heart of Europe at a very unfavorable time.\u201d",

      "Macron cannot run again due to term limits, leaving Le Pen as the current bookmakers\u2019 favorite. One wrinkle for her could be her ongoing trial on accusations of embezzling European Union funds, in which prosecutors are requesting a five-year ban from public office. She denies the charges, calling them an \u201coutrage.\u201d",

      "The raids were executed exactly a year after Russia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that LGBTQ activists and the LGBTQ \u201cmovement\u201d should be designated as extremists. Russians found guilty of extremism can be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison.",
      "Videos and images of the raids shared on social media over the weekend showed stunned clubgoers lying on dance floors with their hands above their heads as police officers sifted through the crowds and shouted orders.",
      "Baza, an anonymously run Telegram news channel that has over 1.5 million followers, reported that police blocked club exits and interrogated clubgoers at Arma before detaining dozens. Clubgoers who were not brought into custody were allowed to leave Arma roughly three hours after the raid began, according to Baza. (Arma, then known as Mutabor, was the site of the 2022 \u201calmost naked\u201d party, which drew fierce criticism after Russian celebrities, influencers and socialites attended clad in revealing clothing months after the invasion of Ukraine.)",
      "Monday was not the first time the Russian government has coordinated a clampdown on \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling last year, gay bars in cities across Russia were similarly raided by police. Sporadic raids have reportedly persisted throughout the country since then.",
      "Critics viewed last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ rights in Russia under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power for roughly a quarter of a century. Notably, the Russian government passed legislation in 2013 known as the \u201cgay propaganda law,\u201d making it illegal \u201cto spread information about nontraditional sexual behavior\u201d to minors. The law was expanded to apply to adults, effectively banning public symbols or gestures of \u201cnontraditional sexual relations.\u201d Russians who violate the so-called propaganda law could face up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) in fines.",
      "Last month, Putin signed additional legislation that bans nationals from countries that allow gender transitions to adopt Russian children."

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol backed down early Wednesday after he tossed his country into turmoil for six hours by suddenly declaring martial law and mobilizing the army.",
      "Yoon did so in the face of nationwide defiance that erupted 155 minutes after he announced in a late-night TV address Tuesday that he was taking over.",
      "Members of parliament raced to the National Assembly building, and, with 190 of its 300 members present, they quickly passed a resolution demanding that Yoon lift his order while protesters opposed to martial law gathered outside the building and the nation's powerful unions threatened to go on strike.",
      "Facing opposition from much of the country and even from the leadership of his own People Power Party, Yoon went back on national television to reverse his martial law declaration.",
      "\u201cI have accepted the decision made by the National Assembly to dissolve and lift the martial law,\u201d Yoon said around 4:30 a.m. Wednesday local time (2:30 p.m. Tuesday ET).",
      "Not long after that, People Power Party leader Han Dong Hoon insisted that Yoon \"personally and thoroughly explain this dire situation in detail.\"",
      "It was an abrupt end to a six-hour standoff that began when Yoon, whose conservative government took office in 2022, suddenly declared martial law late Tuesday and accused opposition parties of sympathizing with North Korea and controlling parliament.",
      "\u201cI am declaring a state of emergency in order to protect the constitutional order based on freedom and eradicate shameful pro-North Korea anti-state groups, that are stealing freedom and happiness of our people,\u201d Yoon said on the country\u2019s YTN news channel. He added that it would protect the country \u201cfrom the threats of North Korea\u2019s communist forces.\u201d",

      "Despite Yoon's martial law declaration, there were no reports of tanks or soldiers on the streets in the capital, Seoul, or elsewhere in South Korea, which is a key U.S. ally in the region and home to around 28,500 American troops.",

      "\u201cWe look to the court for recognition that the conduct which has already caused immense harm to my people and so many others is unlawful, that it must cease, and that its consequences must be repaired,\u201d he said.",

      "While advisory opinions from the International Court of Justice or World Court are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say the court\u2019s eventual opinion on climate change will probably be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond.",

OPEC will not address the court, according to a revised schedule the court issued late on Monday.",
