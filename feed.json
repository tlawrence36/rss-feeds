      "Taylor Swift's new album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" is packed with Easter eggs for fans to decode",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The curtain has been drawn. The stage lights are on. It\u2019s time for \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl.\u201d",
      "For Taylor Swift\u2019s most dedicated audience, a new album means new opportunities to decode Easter eggs in her lyrics and music videos. The pop superstar\u2019s 12th studio album has no shortage of clever clues and references to her public life and discography. Many are opaque, revealing just enough to inspire a myriad of fan theories. Others are concrete \u2013 explicit names and places worth exploring. Below, you will find a guide to those instances, and how they relate to Swift.",
      "Read on, and happy digging!",
      "Lyric: \u201cThat view of Portofino was on my mind / When you called me at the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e\u201d",
      "Meaning: When Swift announced her new album, she did so with the introduction of a shade she\u2019s calling Portofino Orange Glitter after donning the color onstage during the latter part of her \u201cEras Tour.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve just always liked it,\u201d she said of the hue during her first appearance on \u201cNew Heights,\u201d the popular, typically football-focused podcast hosted by her fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce and his brother, Jason Kelce. \u201cIt feels like energetically how my life has felt. And this album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour.\u201d She and beau Kelce were spotted last year in Lake Como, Italy, but it is unclear if they spent time in nearby Portofino. Additionally, the standard version of her album is available in \u201csweat and vanilla perfume Portofino orange vinyl.\u201d As for the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e? That\u2019s a luxury hotel in Paris.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBe my NY when Hollywood hates me\u201d",
      "Meaning: Both locations make appearances in Swift\u2019s songwriting. Among them: \u201cWelcome to New York\u201d from 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and \u201cWhite Horse\u201d from 2008\u2019s \u201cFearless.\u201d She also owns property in both locations.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBabe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust \u2026 just kidding\u201d",
      "Meaning: In August of this year, Swift announced her engagement to Kelce by posting a carousel of images on Instagram. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the ring wasn\u2019t the only jewelry she was showing off. She was also wearing a Cartier watch.",
      "Lyric: \u201cWe hit the best booth at Musso & Frank\u2019s\u201d",
      "Meaning: Since opening in 1919, Musso & Frank Grill has been a hot spot for celebrities in Los Angeles \u2013 embodying the kind of old school Hollywood glamor that inspired \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d artwork.",
      "Lyric: \u201cAll my white diamonds and lovers are forever\u201d",
      "Meaning: The song is titled \u201cElizabeth Taylor\u201d after the classic Hollywood starlet who, in 1991, created her own perfume called \u201cWhite Diamonds.\u201d",
      "Lyric: \u201cYou drive, 85 / Gallatin Road and the lakeside beach\u201d",

      "Oct 2, 11:28 AM",
      "Oct 2, 11:28 AM",
      "Meaning: There are several Gallatin Roads in the United States, but given the other lyrics in the song, this one likely refers to a street in Hendersonville, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville, where Swift spent her adolescence.",
      "Lyric: \u201cBut as the 50 Cent song played\u201d",
      "Meaning: A 50 Cent reference further implies this song is rooted in Swift\u2019s teen years in the \u201900s, when the rapper was at the height of his popularity. The song also mentions \u201cprom\u201d and \u201csecond period,\u201d what is typically associated with high school.",
      "Lyric: \u201cWhen I left school, I lost track of you / Abigail called me with the bad news / Goodbye\u201d",
      "Meaning: Abigail refers to Swift\u2019s best friend AbigailAnderson, who she attended Hendersonville High School with. This marks the second time Abigail is mentioned in Swift\u2019s discography: the first is the evocative \u201cFifteen\u201d from \u201cFearless.\u201d",
      "Lyric: \u201cRedwood tree / It ain\u2019t hard to see\u201d",
      "Meaning: In Oct. 2023, Swift and Kelce made a surprise appearance at \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d for a season premiere episode that featured host Pete Davidson and musical performer/friend to Swift, Ice Spice.Afterwards, \u201cSNL\u201d cast member Bowen Yang described the couple as the \u201ctallest people in the world,\u201d on the \u201cLas Culturistas\u201d podcast he co-hosts with comedian Matt Rogers. \u201cI see them together, I go, \u2018I am in the Redwood Forest.\u2019\u201d Hence, \u201cRedwood tree.\u201d",
      "Lyric: \u201cNew Heights of manhood\u201d",
      "Meaning: \u201cNew Heights\u201d is a direct reference to the Kelces\u2019 podcast of the same name.",
      "Lyric: \u201cSummertime spritz, pink skies\u201d",
      "Meaning: Physical album variants have been a huge part of Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d rollout, and in some ways, they appear in the lyrics of \u201cHoney.\u201d The color of her exclusive vinyl release with Target, \u201cThe Crowd Is Your King\u201d edition, was described online as \u201csummertime spritz pink shimmer.\u201d",
      "Lyric: \u201cWintergreen kiss, all mine\u201d",
      "Meaning: This line relates to another one of her variants: \u201cThe Shiny Bug Collection,\u201d which is available in \u201cviolet shimmer marbled vinyl\u201d and more relevantly, \u201cwintergreen and onyx marbled vinyl.\u201d (\u201cViolet\u201d is mentioned in \u201cElizabeth Tylor,\u201d as is \u201conyx\u201d in \u201cOpalite.\u201d)",

      "Taylor Swift's 12th album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" shows she's still at the top of the cultural mainstream",
      "Who is Taylor Swift\u2019s heir apparent? Her 12th album, \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d offers an answer. It\u2019s Taylor Swift.",
      "Her last album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d ended with the cautionary \u201cClara Bow,\u201d an allegory that seemed to suggest her tenure atop the cultural mainstream was inherited from stars of the past, like the namechecked Stevie Nicks \u2014 and that a new generation of younger, elastic female pop performers could soon take her place. In 2025, there are many to choose from: Consider Chappell Roan\u2019s full-throated theatrics, Olivia Rodrigo\u2019s fiery punk-pop feminism, Sabrina Carpenter\u2019s cheeky sexuality. In the knotty themes of Friday's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d best illustrated in the title track, Swift asserts that the baton hasn\u2019t been passed, but rather shared. Because she isn\u2019t going anywhere.",
      "\u201cAnd all the headshots on the walls / Of the dance halls are of the b------ / Who wish I\u2019d hurry up and die,\u201d she sings with a wink, \u201cBut I\u2019m immortal now, baby dolls / I couldn\u2019t if I tried.\u201d Notably, if she has a chosen successor in someone else, it\u2019s the album\u2019s sole feature: Carpenter, who sings on the stomp-clap closer in her newly adopted twang. The mournful glissando of lap steel \u2014 the album\u2019s most country moment \u2014 arrives only with Carpenter\u2019s introduction. The western genre is Swift\u2019s past and Carpenter\u2019s future.",
      "If Swift is co-signing Carpenter, she\u2019s also learning from her. Carpenter has cornered the market on tight pop songs with pert, provocative messages; Swift does the same with the manspreading swagger of the George Michael-interpolating \u201cFather Figure,\u201d which mentions a protege, and the funky \u201cWood.\u201d (A carefully veiled PG-13 lyric: \u201cHis love was the key / That opened my thighs,\u201d she sings. \u201cGirls, I don\u2019t need to catch the bouquet / To know a hard rock is on the way.\u201d) Interwoven are suggestive, sensual ad-libs ... and a direct reference to fiance Travis Kelce\u2019s podcast.",
      "Across a brisk 12 tracks \u2014 Swift\u2019s tendency toward abundance doesn\u2019t manifest itself in a double album this time around, but instead in her endless vinyl variants \u2014 \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d mostly delivers on its promise of up-tempo pop \u201cbangers,\u201d to borrow her own vernacular. Fans need not wait up for the long-anticipated \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version),\u201d because \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d pulls from its essence. But this time, with a lot of affection, like a truer \u201cLover\u201d era.",
      "Swift has long internalized criticisms and responded to them in her art, most directly in 2017\u2019s \u201cReputation.\u201d Here, she is once again concerned with her perception, articulated over booming, lush production on \u201cCANCELLED!\u201d or \u201cElizabeth Taylor.\u201d On the latter, she sings, \u201cHollywood hates me / You\u2019re only as hot as your last hit, baby.\u201d Except this time, her love acts as an anchor. \u201cI can\u2019t have fun if I can\u2019t have you,\u201d she flirts.",
      "For \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl,\u201d Swift enlisted Swedish producers Max Martin and Shellback, the hitmaking duo she collaborated with on 2012\u2019s \u201cRed,\u201d 2014\u2019s \u201c1989\u201d and, of course, \u201cReputation.\u201d Notably absent is her frequent producing partner Jack Antonoff. It\u2019s a wise decision: In years past, Swift, Shellback and Martin\u2019s pop experiments shifted not only her career trajectory but the genre itself. Before \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together,\u201d an EDM drop in the middle of a radio pop hit was unimaginable. After, the style would dominate for half the decade.",
      "\u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d isn\u2019t as seismic, but there are addictive and idiosyncratic Swiftisms here: acerbic wit and thick literary references in glassy pop hooks. Where a song like \u201cOpalite,\u201d if attempted by another other performer, would lose its weightlessness under its voluble aspirations, Swift manages to swoon. Stacked, opalescent harmonies and a vintage swing give the song, fittingly, an almost iridescent quality.",
      "And there are bops, like the undeniable opener \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d with its 1980s-via-Robyn synth-pop and momentary \u201cSummertime Sadness\u201d vocal delivery.",
      "There\u2019s a treasure trove of deliciously quotable lines, too, as expected. \u201cPlease God bring me a best friend who I think is hot,\u201d she manages to make effortless in the \u201cMidnights\u201d-esque \u201cWi$h Li$t,\u201d a lovely song about the mundanity of romance and the suburban fantasy of \u201ca couple kids \u2026 a driveway with a basketball hoop.\u201d",
      "Swift\u2019s dense vocabulary is on full display, often full of charm. But it is sometimes unwieldy, a common criticism of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d like when she overstuffs \u201cOur thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition on foolish decisions which led to misguided visions\u201d into \u201cFather Figure,\u201d momentarily overvaluing clever writing over clever cadence.",

But sonically, it is a thoughtful acoustic ballad with emo movement, in which Swift contends with her \u201cterminal uniqueness\u201d and deep dedication to a loved one.

      "Benny Safdie's The Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is",
      "Benny Safdie\u2019s \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d isn\u2019t what you think it is, especially if you think it\u2019s a movie about a British guy who thinks his typewriter is the tops.",
      "\u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d would seem to bear all the hallmarks of something grittier, darker and more disturbing than it is. It\u2019s the solo directorial debut of the younger Safdie, whose films with his brother, Josh, have rarely not sprinted headlong into unsettling tumult. Add that sensibility to a true-life tale of a mixed martial arts fighter in the late \u201990s, and it\u2019s only natural to spend much of \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bracing for tragedy, for some ear-splitting descent into macho calamity.",
      "Yet \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d starring Dwayne Johnson as MMA pioneer Mark Kerr, is something simpler and less curious. A lack of probing was never anything you could accuse a Safdie brothers\u2019 movie of; these are the filmmakers who plunged a camera into the body cavity of a jewelry-store owner in \u201cUncut Gems.\u201d But, despite its grainy, VHS aesthetics, \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is a surprisingly conventional and oddly untroubled movie, albeit one that gives Johnson an indie-film platform for one of his finest performances.",
      "As Mark, Johnson has drained away much of his big-screen charisma. The part \u2014 brawny, often shirtless, frequently raging in the ring \u2014 is immediately so close to Johnson\u2019s own professional wrestling background that early scenes look almost documentary-like. But gone is the megawatt grin and the dashing eyebrow lift. Johnson\u2019s normally polished bald head is here covered with a closely cropped dark head of hair.",
      "In the movie\u2019s opening, Mark rhapsodizes about his feeling of domination. An opponent\u2019s fear, he says, you can \u201csmell in their scent.\u201d At this point, Mark has known only victory in thumping triumphs that leave him feeling like a god. Losing, he confesses, is unfathomable.",
      "The laws of moviedom decree, of course, that Mark will soon lose, and his well-earned sense of invincibility will shatter. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d bounces between Mark\u2019s home and Japan, where the Pride Fighting Championship takes place. That\u2019s where Mark, a much-celebrated champion, is taken down by an illegal but nevertheless humbling move. After the fact, the match is ruled a tie, but the stink of defeat never dissipates.",
      "The real battle, in any case, is at home. Mark\u2019s dependence on opioids for the punishing extremes he endures is becoming desperate. \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d is based on John Hyams\u2019s 2002 documentary of the same name, and part of the nature of that film was the curiosity of Mark\u2019s extreme violence in the ring and his otherwise sweet passivity. In Safdie\u2019s film, Mark is asked in the doctor\u2019s waiting room if fighters hate each other during a bout. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he replies.",
      "But while we don\u2019t doubt Mark\u2019s sincerity \u2014 he\u2019s as earnest as he is muscle-bound \u2014 Johnson also exudes an inner turmoil, and a struggle to keep his rage at bay while nursing mounting wounds to his ego. His body is so stiff, it\u2019s like he could snap at any moment.",

      "That\u2019s the case for Mark, most of all, around his wife, Dawn Staples (Emily Blunt), a former Playboy model who's shown as alternatively supportive and insensitive to Mark\u2019s situation. They feud often, sometimes immediately before a match, sometimes over how to make his shakes. When he tries to give up opioids, he takes her late-night drinking as a provocation. \u201cTreat me like a man,\u201d he tells her.",
      "It\u2019s an awkward, perhaps judgmental characterization that would be all the more glaring if it weren\u2019t for Blunt\u2019s tact as a performer. But it throws \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d off course, especially when the movie seems to want to lean more on its other central relationship: that of Mark and his friend, trainer and sometimes competitor Mark Coleman (played by former Bellator champion Ryan Bader).",
      "In his films with his brother, Safdie has long brought real-life figures into their movie worlds, blurring fictional boundaries. Bader gives \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d a dose of documentary in his presence, but I\u2019d argue that Johnson\u2019s proximity to this world gives the movie its most compelling real-life echoes.",
      "I happen to think Johnson is also very good in full movie-star mode, especially when he has the chance to wryly undercut his big-screen presence in comedies like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d or \u201cThe Tooth Fairy.\u201d But it\u2019s also captivating to see him so thoroughly settled into a character like he is in \u201cThe Smashing Machine\u201d while totally shorn of his charisma.",
      "Yet the potency of that performance is let down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat \u2014 a mountain of a man who looks like he could, without barely trying, rip someone\u2019s head off at any moment. Instead he takes a deep breath, and doesn\u2019t.",

      "NEW YORK -- In 1983, six thieves muscled their way into a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, expecting to find a large sum of foreign currency. They got much more than they bargained for \u2014 26 million pounds worth of gold bars.",
      "What happened in the days and years next is the subject of PBS\u2019 \u201cMasterpiece\u201d enthralling series \u201cThe Gold,\u201d which traces the ripple effects of Britain's biggest robbery, going from a local search to infiltrating an international money laundering cartel. It starts airing Sunday.",
      "\u201cFrom the minute the show starts, the pressure's on,\u201d says showrunner Neil Forsyth. \u201cThere\u2019s a clock ticking, there\u2019s a net tightening and all these things. So it\u2019s lovely to write characters under that continual pressure.\u201d",
      "The so-called Brinks-Mat heist rocked Britain, leading to changes in banking laws, policing and shining a light on official corruption. Much of the gold was never located. It was melted down and sold back into the financial system, with the proceeds laundered into real estate.",

      "It is often said of our greatest actors that they could compellingly recite the phone book.",
      "There's no doubt, just to continue that thought for a moment, that Daniel Day-Lewis is one of our greatest living actors \u2014 perhaps truly the best of them all. And so the first and most important thing to say about \u201cAnemone,\u201d a bleak, somber, absorbing but also sometimes frustratingly opaque collaboration with his director son Ronan, is that it's brought Day-Lewis back. He told us eight years ago that he was done with acting, and we hoped he was exaggerating. At least for now, it seems he was.",
      "As for the phone book: Well, there\u2019s a moment here where you might wish that was indeed the content you were hearing. In one of two remarkable monologues that punctuate a movie otherwise spare with words, Day-Lewis, playing a bitter and lonely recluse, lets loose an anecdote so shockingly scatological and epically disgusting \u2014 the script is co-written by father and son, by the way \u2014 that it\u2019s hard to erase from one\u2019s mind (still trying, here). Somehow, he makes it more fascinating than revolting \u2014 but it\u2019s a Herculean task, something Day-Lewis the actor is obviously no stranger to.",
      "The film's title refers to a flower that we briefly see growing in the lush woodlands where we find Day-Lewis\u2019 character, Ray, eking out the sparest of existences. The father-son writers take their time explaining why exactly Ray has consigned himself to this solitary life, but we get a key hint in the first frames of the film \u2014 violent kids\u2019 drawings, with stick figures carrying long guns, and severed limbs.",
      "We soon learn that both Ray and brother Jem (Sean Bean) were British soldiers, veterans of the early days of the Northern Ireland troubles. They're also victims of a violent childhood in care homes.",
      "But they haven't seen each other in two decades, their bond torn asunder by some unrevealed trauma that led them to each seek comfort \u2014 or absolution \u2014 in different places. Jem has found it in strict religious practice, and home life with Nessa, Ray's former partner, and Brian, their son.",
      "It is teenager Brian\u2019s deepening troubles that have spurred Jem to seek out his brother in the lush but forbidding woods, where Ray leads an ascetic life devoted to the most basic human survival. Ronan Day-Lewis, a painter making his feature directorial debut, is at his best in creating, along with cinematographer Ben Fordesman, a sense of the unpredictability of nature, culminating in a dramatic hailstorm.",

But the brothers connect, slowly, in mundane activities like brushing their teeth, swimming in the ocean, or dancing wildly together.",
      "The words do come tumbling when Ray relates his tale of how he wrought revenge upon a priest who repeatedly molested him as a child. This bracing monologue \u2014 in which he describes defecating on the man in sickening detail \u2014 is only a precursor to an extraordinary speech later in the film that is vintage Day-Lewis, a searing account of the life-altering moment he killed a young boy. \u201cI don\u2019t need your absolution,\u201d he snarls to his brother, when the latter tries to veer him away from the guilt and shame that have crippled him for 20 years.",
      "But clearly Ray does need some sort of absolution, and his confession to his brother is that first step.",
      "Will Ray find a way to come in from the cold and reconnect with his son? The artistic parallels are a little too neat to ignore \u2014 a son bringing Day-Lewis the actor back into view, for the benefit of us all.",

      "But the big-screen absence of the actor many would peg as the greatest one alive ends with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a new film directed by his son, Ronan Day-Lewis. The two of them wrote it together. What began as something small, with no real ambition, grew until a full feature film and Day-Lewis\u2019 long-awaited return to movies.",
      "\u201cIt saddened me that I had perhaps ruled myself out of that when I decided to work on something else for a while,\u201d Day-Lewis said in an interview alongside his son. \u201cAs we progressed through it, and it seemed less and less possible to contain it, like two fellas in a shed, it began to alarm me slightly. I understood that this was going to involve the full paraphernalia of a film production, and that wasn\u2019t something I was eager to get back into.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut we just kept moving forward to see what would happen,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd this is what happened.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnemone,\u201d which recently premiered at the New York Film Festival and which Focus Features releases Friday in theaters, finds Day-Lewis, now 68, not even slightly less intense or magnetic a performer. It\u2019s a father-son story, though not an autobiographical one. Day-Lewis stars as Ray Stoker, a solitary hermit living in a remote cabin. His brother, Jem (Sean Bean), arrives and tries to convince him to return to his teenage son.",
      "Since 2017\u2019s \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Day-Lewis has, among other things, studied violin making in Boston. But he has also come to think of his declaration of retirement as a mistake, or not quite what he intended. At least, it wasn\u2019t enough to stand in the way of him making a movie with his son.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s been imagined on my behalf by numerous commentators, people that don\u2019t know me, that somehow the way I work has left me so debilitated I can barely open my eyes in the morning. This then requires a period of five or six years recovery!\u201d Day-Lewis says. \u201cThat was never the case. The work itself was always nourishing to me.\u201d",
      "Yet after making \u201cPhantom Thread,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s London-set portrait of a perfectionist couturier, Day-Lewis was uncertain that he would ever regenerate the appetite to tackle another role.",

And it\u2019s something I never found a solution to from the day I started doing this work until now. The public aspect of my life I\u2019ve always been baffled by.\u201d",
      "The most meaningful gesture Day-Lewis is offering his son might not be making a movie with him, but returning to the spotlight for it. At the New York Film Festival, Day-Lewis has been a happy, humble presence, calling himself a fool for his professed retirement and dutifully accepting a glare of attention that he\u2019s largely avoided for the last decade.",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s weighed heavily over the years, this sort of misconception which has now become so ludicrous about Method acting, which is a very bad name in the business now,\u201d says Day-Lewis. \u201cWe all find a different way of approaching the same problems. And when we\u2019re on the set, it makes no goddamn difference what system you train under, Meisner or Method or Stanislavski or whatever it might be. You\u2019re just there trying to live in those moments, to burn yourself up trying to find that truth as well as you can.\u201d",
      "Day-Lewis has sensed some of the same all-consuming imagination in Ronan, a 27-year-old painter making his directorial debut. He\u2019s one of two sons Day-Lewis has with his wife, filmmaker Rebecca Miller. (He also has an older son, Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis, from his past relationship with Isabelle Adjani.) From a young age, Day-Lewis saw how invested his son was in creating imagery. Ronan, meanwhile, grew up marveling from a distance at his father\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cIt always held a huge amount of mystery to me what he was doing,\u201d says Ronan, who has vivid memories of being on set for films like \u201cThere Will Be Blood\u201d and \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose.\u201d \u201cTo be inside this realm that I had always been watching curiously from the outside was so intriguing. But there were aspects of his process that still remained a mystery to me, which I think helped, actually.\u201d",
      "For Day-Lewis, building the character of Ray was a step-by-step process that included everything in his woodland world, right down to the expired tin cans of sardines that line his shelves. (\u201cThere were never enough sardines for me,\u201d he says, smiling.) \u201cAnemone\u201d unfolds in fits and starts, with several glorious, improvised monologues surrounded with strikingly lush imagery by Ronan. Day-Lewis so relishes pushing the boundaries of such a fictional world that, once in it, he tends to not want to let go.",
      "\u201cYou hope to create a world, an illusion. And when somebody says to you, \u2018That was the last shot. Go home now,\u2019 that was so bewildering to me because I\u2019m still invested in that world,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not I have trouble letting go of it. The trouble I have is that I want to still splash around in that illusion.\u201d",
      "Still, it seems Day-Lewis has in \u201cAnemone\u201d avoided the kind of post-film feeling that followed \u201cPhantom Thread.\u201d The actor hasn\u2019t yet announced a forthcoming project, but he acknowledges feeling the capacity for more. While he doesn\u2019t say he missed acting during the last eight years, he appears to have come to some self-acceptance of its fundamental, irrevocable place in his life.",
      "\u201cIt has been my primary form of self-expression for my entire life, since I was a child,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd therefore, I don\u2019t know if I experience it as a sense of missing if I\u2019m not doing it. But the need to express myself in that way, even at a subterranean level, that is still there.\u201d",

      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck examines the prophetic messages of George Orwell in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "Filmmaker Raoul Peck uses George Orwell\u2019s writings to weave together a biographical portrait of the author and a dispiriting picture of power and truth in the modern world in \u201cOrwell: 2+2=5.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s hardly the first to connect the dots between Orwell\u2019s prophetic writings and the current state of things \u2014 remember, sales for \u201cNineteen Eighty-Four\u201d soared in the months following Donald Trump\u2019s first election when phrases like \u201calternative facts\u201d were being used with no irony. Knowing that, Peck draws heavily on what has come before. The film is packed with clips from film adaptations of \u201c1984,\u201d including Michael Anderson\u2019s black and white version from 1956, and Michael Radford\u2019s, released in 1984, documentaries, like Robert Kane Pappas\u2019s 2003 warning \u201cOrwell Rolls in His Grave,\u201d and news footage from World War II through Gaza. In sum, it makes a persuasive point that things are only getting worse.",
      "\u201cOrwell: 2+2=5\u201d is loosely structured around Orwell\u2019s time on the Isle of Jura, in Scotland, where he wrote what would be his last novel, \u201c1984,\u201d while his health was deteriorating from tuberculosis. He went to Jura in 1946 and was dead by 1950. But this is no Wikipedia page or college lecture. There are no talking heads and no one explaining, \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d",
      "Instead, it\u2019s a loose assembly of biography, reflection and key moments of political awakening, with actor Damian Lewis narrating Orwell\u2019s words with a poetic gravitas, interspersed with a collage of images, words and archival footage. Anything from David Lean\u2019s \u201cOliver Twist\u201d and Sydney Pollack \u201cOut of Africa\u201d to Lauren Greenfield\u2019s \u201cGeneration Wealth\u201d is on the table, and nothing is there carelessly. Alexei Aigui\u2019s powerful score adds a melancholy weight to sequences showing wartime destruction past and present along with the political phrases used to describe them: A \u201cstrategic bombing\u201d in Berlin in 1945, \u201cpeacekeeping operations\u201d in Mariupol in 2022, \u201cclearance operation\u201d in Myanmar in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s a purposefully disorienting effect to the film\u2019s editing, blending past, present, fiction and reality in such a way that it all begins to blur together. By the time we\u2019re hearing Lewis utter Orwell\u2019s famous phrase \u201cthe very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world\u201d while AI images pollute the screen, it\u2019s easy to forget that the quote is seven decades old. It won\u2019t prepare you for any kind of historical report on Orwell, totalitarianism or doublespeak, but its impact is undeniable.",
      "Orwell understood that every writer is a product of their own time. Born Eric Arthur Blair in Motihari, Bihar, then an outpost of the British Empire, Peck focuses in on a photograph of him as a baby with his Indian nursemaid. Describing himself as \u201clower upper middle class,\u201d Orwell attended Eton and served with the British Imperial Police in Burma (now Myanmar) and observed how power manifested in colonial outposts, how class unattainable in England was suddenly accessible to any white man simply because they were white. He considered himself both a snob and a revolutionary, which only intensified as he picked up more life experiences through the Spanish Civil War, his time at the BBC and simply observing ordinary people around him. It\u2019s actually quite extraordinary just how much information Peck, who has delved into the lives of James Baldwin, Karl Marx, Patrice Lumumba and Ernest Cole, is able to convey in just under two hours.",

      "Police video obtained by The Associated Press shows country music star Morgan Wallen denied throwing a chair off a Nashville bar roof before and after his 2024 arrest",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Country music star Morgan Wallen denied to police that he threw a chair off a Nashville honky-tonk bar roof before and after he was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment in 2024, police video obtained by The Associated Press shows.",
      "Roughly two weeks after his April 2024 arrest, Wallen commented on social media: \u201cI'm not proud of my behavior, and I accept responsibility\u201d and said he \u201cmade amends\u201d with Nashville law enforcement and others. Then in December, he pleaded guilty to two counts.",
      "The Metro Nashville Police Department released the footage of Wallen\u2019s arrest, captured by several officers' body and cruiser cameras, in response to a public records request from the AP. A previously released arrest affidavit did not get into the details of what Wallen told officers.",
      "A police car camera shows two officers, who were standing outside, react to something apparently falling from above on a late Sunday night. And one officer\u2019s body camera video begins with a shot of a broken chair in the road near his parked police cruiser, close to Chief\u2019s on Broadway, in the city's entertainment district.",
      "Then, as Wallen and his bodyguard team come down to the main entrance on Broadway, one of the men with Wallen is shouting, \u201cHe didn\u2019t see anything. You don\u2019t have witnesses, you are accusing!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t throw nothing, he didn\u2019t throw nothing,\u201d the bodyguard continues, and accuses two bar workers of \u201cbeing aggressive.\u201d",
      "When an officer asks Wallen what happened, the musician replies, \u201cI don't know.\u201d",
      "He later tells another officer, \u201cWe\u2019ve not tried to cause no problems, man. I don\u2019t know what they are \u2014 I don\u2019t know why.\u201d",
      "That officer said police were figuring out what happened after a chair came flying off the roof and landed by his patrol car. Wallen replied, \u201cAs you should.\u201d",
      "At one point, Wallen is on his cellphone, then points it at the officer and says, \u201cEric Church is on the phone.\u201d Church, another country star, co-owns Chief's. During the call, Wallen had used an expletive to describe the officers he said were \u201ctrying to take me to jail outside of your (expletive) bar.\u201d",
      "Church, who can't be heard on the police recording, recommended to the officer that Wallen wait in a private space instead of standing on the public sidewalk, said a representative for Church.",
      "The officer responds: \u201cIt\u2019s not really something we can do. Law enforcement have to enforce the laws. Figure out what happened. We\u2019ve got a supervisor coming to the scene. Gotta treat it like we would with anybody else.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Wallen did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Back in the bar, police were in an office watching security footage from the roof, body camera footage shows. The security video was not clear from the officers' body cameras and a police spokesperson said there was no security camera footage from the bar in the case files.",
      "The officers return outside and a sergeant, who says he watched security video of Wallen throwing a chair off the roof, handcuffs him.",
      "Another officer talks to two witnesses. One, referring to the chair, says she saw Wallen \u201clift it up and throw it off\u201d and laugh.",

      "Georgia police say Tyrese Gibson failed to turn himself in late last week after an arrest warrant was issued for cruelty to animals",
      "Tyrese Gibson failed to turn himself in to police after an arrest warrant was issued because his four Cane Corso dogs mauled and killed a neighbor\u2019s dog in Georgia in mid-September, police said Tuesday.",
      "The warrant for cruelty to animals issued for the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d actor is part of an \u201congoing issue\u201d following multiple calls about the dogs in the past few months, Fulton County Police Captain Nicole Dwyer said.",
      "\u201cOur priority is the safety of the community and when there\u2019s so many incidents of dogs, especially large dogs like this, getting out and then killing an animal, you know, what\u2019s next? A child?\u201d Dwyer said. \u201cOur main priority is safety and that\u2019s why we want the dogs in custody.\u201d",
      "Gibson had received multiple warnings before the warrant was issued, and police had attempted to cite him before the attack, but the actor wasn\u2019t at his Atlanta home. Dwyer said she spoke with Gibson\u2019s lawyer last week and informed them the actor had to turn himself in by Friday.",
      "Gibson\u2019s attorney, Gabe Banks, wrote to in an email to The Associated Press the actor is \u201ccooperating fully with authorities to address and resolve this matter responsibly.\u201d Gibson wasn\u2019t home when the incident took place, Banks wrote, and \u201cimmediately made the difficult decision to rehome his dogs to a safe and loving environment.\u201d",
      "Just after 10 p.m. on Sept. 18, a neighbor of Gibson\u2019s, whose house is half a mile away, let their dog, a small spaniel, out to their yard and returned five minutes later to find the dog had been attacked. The dog was rushed to a veterinary hospital, but did not survive, Dwyer said.",

      "Bad Bunny captivated audiences with his residency in Puerto Rico, inspiring patriotism and drawing half a million people to the island this summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Crowds wore maga flowers and \u201cpavas\u201d \u2014 straw hats traditionally worn by j\u00edbaros, Puerto Rican rural farmers. They drank Medalla beer and danced salsa.",
      "Over the course of a 31-date residency at the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, Bad Bunny worked a miracle, inspiring patriotism in the hearts of a proud Boricua people, and in those traveling to Puerto Rico for the first time. He performed on two stages, one showcasing the island's natural beauty with its flamboyan and plantain trees, and another, a casita (\u201clittle house\u201d), for the pari de marquesina, a house party.",
      "If all the world's a stage \u2014 might as well make it home.",
      "In February, it can be expected that the artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio will bring the same spirit to the 2026 Super Bowl. And he'll do so in Spanish \u2014 a landmark moment for Latino culture.",
      "Bad Bunny's \u201cNo Me Quiero Ir De Aqu\u00ed\u201d residency (in English, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Leave Here\u201d) bypassed a traditional U.S. tour, bringing approximately half a million people to the island during the slow summer tourism season and generating an estimated $733 million for Puerto Rico. Across three hours, attendees were guided through a musical history \u2014 reggaet\u00f3n hits from Bad Bunny's singular discography as well as the folkloric styles of his latest album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d (\u201cI Should Have Taken More Photos.\")",
      "There was a political history, too: like in the affecting song \u201cLo Que Pas\u00f3 a Hawaii,\u201d (\u201cWhat Happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for Puerto Rico's autonomy. Or 2022's \u201cEl Apag\u00f3n\u201d (\u201cThe Blackout\u201d), in reference to Hurricane Maria, its aftermath and the continued anger and frustration over persistent, chronic power outages.",
      "Of course, a Super Bowl halftime show traditionally runs 12 to 15 minutes. It's not a lot of time to bring Puerto Rico, or its complicated colonial history, to the NFL's mainstream \u2014 but it is enough for a taste.",
      "It's worth mentioning Benito has done so before: making a surprise appearance at the Super Bowl in 2020, during Shakira and Jennifer Lopez's performance. He sang in Spanish alongside two artists whose bilingual hits helped usher in a crossover era for Latin music in the \u201800s. He\u2019s a direct inheritor of their successes, and he's been able to kick the door down further \u2014 helping to establish an industry where Latino superstars need not record their music in English to have a career.",
      "Bad Bunny is simultaneously an interesting and an obvious choice for the NFL: One of the most popular artists on the planet who understands that going global means embracing the local, performing during the most-watched television program of the year.",
      "In a recent interview with i-D Magazine, Bad Bunny mentioned that one of the reasons his residency bypassed the continental U.S. were concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos.",
      "\u201cThere was the issue of \u2014 like, (expletive) ICE could be outside (my concert). And it\u2019s something that we were talking about and very concerned about,\u201d he told the publication, referencing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico since large-scale arrests began in late January, surprising many in the U.S. territory that has long welcomed migrants.) It resonated with Latinos and the Spanish speaking community, who have grown increasingly weary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation.",
      "Bad Bunny has long been critical of Trump and backed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. \u201cI will never forget what Donald Trump did and what he did not do when Puerto Rico needed a caring and a competent leader,\u201d he said in a video last year.",
      "For some Trump supporters, Bad Bunny's booking at the 2026 Super Bowl is a divisive political pick. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson described Bad Bunny as an \u201canti-ICE activist\" on Instagram.",

      "At the very least, Bad Bunny, who performs in Spanish and will do so at the Super Bowl, is set to make history, further proving that connecting with a U.S. and international audience does not require singing in English.",
      "The question is \u2014 what messages will Bad Bunny deliver in a culture where identity is politicized? And what does it mean that his performance arrives in the midst of one of the largest immigration crackdowns in U.S. history, where Latinos are especially vulnerable?",
      "In February, Kendrick Lamar's 2025 Super Bowl halftime performance made art of his short set, offering a meta commentary on race and America. \u201cThe revolution \u2019bout to be televised,\u201d he announced early in the performance.",
      "It featured actor Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, whose character critiqued the rapper and his dancers dressed in red, white and blue for being \u201ctoo loud, too reckless, too ghetto,\u201d reminding them to \u201cplay the game.\u201d There was the sense that Lamar was breaking the fourth wall, reminding viewers of the NFL's political associations following Colin Kaepernick\u2019s kneeling protests and the Black Lives Matter movement.",
      "That Lamar was able to weave American themes into his history-making performance as the first solo hip-hop artist to ever headline the coveted slot will no doubt benefit Bad Bunny. At the very least, he may learn from the rapper's layered and conceptual narratives, that messages on the NFL stage do not need to be explicit to be effective.",
      "At every date of his residency, Bad Bunny invited celebrities \u2014 among them LeBron James, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 \u2014 to join in his party. He also performed with many musicians, including Puerto Rico heavyweights Jowell y Randy, Arc\u00e1ngel and notably Marc Anthony. The pair duetted \u201cPreciosa,\u201d which is viewed as one of Puerto Rico\u2019s unofficial anthems.",
      "Written by Puerto Rican composer Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez Mar\u00edn in 1937, \u201cPreciosa\u201d references Puerto Rico\u2019s hybrid identity \u2014 a mix of Spanish, African and the indigenous Taino cultures \u2014 and threats made to the island in its long colonial history. (\u201cNo importa el tirano te trate con negra maldad,\u201d goes the chorus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter that the tyrant treats you with black hatred.\u201d) It also arrived shortly after the 1937 Ponce massacre, in which a peaceful march organized by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party ended in a police shooting where 19 died and 200 were injured.",
      "It's common for Super Bowl halftime performances to bring surprise guests into their sets \u2014 and no doubt Bad Bunny will do the same \u2014 but who he chooses will wait to be seen. If he pulls from the book of Lamar, any collaboration may have veiled political weight \u2014 informed by his residency, but softened for the NFL crowd.",

      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",

      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over.

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",

      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "Trump has a long history of inserting politics into sports. He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",
      "The moves are part of his broader efforts to shape the country\u2019s cultural mood, weighing in on entertainers and companies alike. He blasted late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, whose show briefly faced suspension after the Trump administration signaled potential repercussions following remarks in the wake of conservative activist Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination.",
      "He also revived his long-running feud with Rosie O\u2019Donnell, saying earlier this year that he was considering \u201ctaking away\u201d her U.S. citizenship after she criticized his proposed spending cuts.",
      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "The death toll from a stampede at a political rally in India's Tamil Nadu state has reached 40",
      "NEW DELHI -- The death toll following a stampede at a political rally for a popular Indian actor and politician in the southern state of Tamil Nadu has climbed to 40, the state\u2019s health minister said Sunday, as medics treated at least 124 injured in hospitals.",
      "Ma Subramanian told The Associated Press that 36 victims were dead by the time they were taken to a hospital on Saturday night and four more died later. He said the injured were largely stable. The dead included nine children, Subramanian said.",
      "Tens of thousands of people gathered in the district of Karur on Saturday to attend the rally by Joseph Vijay Chandrasekhar, popularly and professionally known as Vijay, amid sweltering heat.

      "In southern Indian states, particularly Tamil Nadu, some film stars have larger than life status, rooted in the ancient Tamil culture of hero worship. Many have become successful politicians and some have even been given divine status.",
      "S. Sabesan, a local resident who was at the rally, said Vijay was supposed to address the rally around noon but arrived more than six hours late. He said by that time, a large crowd had choked the roads.",

      "R. Rajendaran, a lawyer in Karur who witnessed the rally and subsequent accident, said at one point Vijay threw water bottles into the crowd from atop his campaign vehicle.",
      "\u201cWhen he decided to leave and his vehicle started moving, commotion broke out as hundreds of his fans and supporters chased his vehicle,\u201d Rajendaran said. \u201cThat is what led to the stampede.\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 New Mexico lawmakers moved quickly Thursday at a special legislative session to prop up funding for food assistance and rural health care services in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to federal spending on Medicaid and nutrition programs.",
      "The Democratic-led Legislature sent a flurry of bills to Gov.

      "At the same time, Democrats and some GOP legislators voted to backfill subsidies to health insurance on New Mexico\u2019s Affordable Health Care exchange in case federal credits are allowed to expire. The federal subsidies are a major sticking point of the budget standoff in Washington that prompted the federal government shutdown Wednesday.",
      "In a news release, Lujan Grisham said she'll sign the bills to protect families from being priced out of insurance and ensure health care services are provided in small communities.",
      "Many federal health care changes under Trump's big bill don\u2019t kick in until 2027 or later, and Democratic legislators in New Mexico acknowledged that their bills are only a temporary bandage.",
      "\u201cSome of the most significant (federal) cuts are delayed a few years, and these are deeply significant,\u201d said state Rep.

      "The idea of meditating can be intimidating to beginners",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea of meditating can be intimidating. Beginners may imagine sitting uncomfortably in silence while breathing deeply and scrubbing all thoughts from their minds. The prospect of trying those techniques at work may feel embarrassing.",
      "But there are ways to bring short, inconspicuous sessions into the workday if you want to see if meditation can help you deal with challenging customers or reduce anxiety while preparing for a presentation. And experienced practitioners say there's no right or wrong way to do it.",
      "\u201c Meditation is quite easy, as a matter of fact. I think there\u2019s a stigma around it, that you have to be in complete silence, and you have to have some room setup, or do some chanting, or some serious breathing,\u201d said Michelle Beyer, a wellness coach who owns the Brooklyn women\u2019s gym Alana Life & Fitness. \u201cThere\u2019s one-minute meditations you can do to make yourself feel great. Nobody will even know you\u2019re doing them.\"",
      "While there are different meditation techniques, many traditions encourage focusing on breathing to help calm the mind. When thoughts pop up, imagine letting them go. Practitioners say meditating before or at work helps them maintain focus, sit still and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cThere is a calm that I am definitely missing when I have forgotten to do it for a few days,\u201d said Brianna Healy, who meditates for 10 minutes daily before starting her job as assistant director of strategic initiatives and data solutions at Naropa University, a college in Boulder, Colorado, that is inspired by Buddhist principles. \u201cI can always tell the difference in my demeanor.\"",
      "If you feel pressed for time, try fitting meditation sessions into breaks. You can set a timer and focus on breathing while sitting at a desk, in a restroom, inside a vehicle or outside, Beyer said.",
      "Here are some easy mini-meditations to try out on the job.",
      "Commuters can consider getting to work a little early and taking a pause in their cars or a quiet location to decompress from getting out the door and to your destination, said Kathryn Remati, a meditation teacher and author of \u201cBefriend Yourself.\u201d If you only have a minute or two, that's still enough time to try Remati's instructions for a quick reset.",
      "Close your eyes and take a long, slow, deep breath to fill your tummy and lungs with air, she said. Hold the breath for a second, and then slowly breathe out like you're blowing out a candle. \"You\u2019ll immediately feel a shift and you\u2019ll feel like a human again,\u201d Remati said.",
      "While repeating that process, consider setting a positive intention, or goal, for the day. Instead of focusing on a to-do list, think about how you want behave towards others, she said. Some intention examples are, \u201cToday I\u2019m going to be productive, but I\u2019m also going to a good listener\u201d or \u201cI want to have a positive attitude,\u201d she said.",
      "Visualization is another technique that experienced meditators use. Picture yourself succeeding at the challenges you\u2019ll encounter that day. If there\u2019s an upcoming deadline, envision yourself finishing the task 10 minutes early. Jumping for joy. Get specific like a movie director and imagine the colors in the room or the feeling of wind on your face, Remati said.",
      "Throughout the day, \u201cyou can bring up that image anytime you need it to refocus,\u201d she said.",
      "You can also use visualization to reframe your perspective on colleagues or clients. A technique Remati recommends putting into practice before meetings may seem quirky: Envision a white light over the meeting room's doorway that showers the people entering with brightness. Remati says it may help you imagine them in a better light. \u201cYou can even put some sort of pink bubble around people,\" she added.",
      "Another short meditation that can be done almost anywhere involves breathing deeply and mentally scanning your body for sensations, a technique popularized in the U.S. by mindfulness practitioner Jon Kabat-Zinn. Depending on your location and comfort level, you can keep your eyes open or closed.",

      "\u201cYou\u2019re intentionally scanning your body,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking about, how do your feet feel in your shoes? How do your ankles feel? Knees, hips, ribs, shoulders, neck, head, and by the time you know it, you checked in with every part of your body.\"",
      "Another discreet meditation technique is breathing deeply and joining your pointer finger to your thumb to form a circle. You can do this if you feel your stress level rising. \u201cSay to yourself, whenever I put my finger and thumb together, I will be able to be peaceful and open-minded,\u201d Remati said.",
      "If you're in a meeting and start to feel resentful or left out, you can do it under the table, and no one will know, she added. Remati does this herself if she notices she's becoming judgmental or short-tempered. \u201cYou just do the finger and thumb, take a nice deep breath, get grounded, and then get back into the meeting and feeling positive,\u201d she said.",
      "One of Beyer's favorite techniques is best done when there aren't a lot of people nearby. Truck drivers can do it in traffic. You inhale, and then when you're breathing out, you hum with your lips closed, she said.",
      "\u201cIt's going to immediately take down stress levels in the body and even in the mind,\u201d Beyer said. \u201cWhen you inhale and you focus on humming, then your brain is focused on that, not the \u2018what ifs' or the worries that like to take over when we feel stressed.\u201d",
      "If you feel self-conscious about humming in a quiet office, you can step outside or head to a noisier place.",
      "The shoulder and jaw release technique also may help relax the bodies of train passengers or drivers or stuck in traffic, Beyer said. To start, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. Repeat that, and then on the third exhale, roll your shoulders back. Inhale a fourth time and then on the next exhale relax your tongue and jaw, Beyer said. Finally, inhale again, bring your attention to your hands and just let them hang heavy, she said. Then breathe in and out a sixth time.",
      "Another technique Remati encourages is saying mantras or affirmations, which are positive statements or slogans you repeat to yourself. You can write them down and say them in your head or out loud while breathing deeply, before a meeting or at any point throughout the day.",
      "Some phrases you might say: \u201cI am calm.\" Deep breath. \u201cI am confident.\u201d Deep breath. \"I am ready for success,\u201d Remati suggested. \u201cI speak my truth. I am patient. I am here for the highest good of all.\u201d",

      "Pete Carroll returned to coaching to take on the challenge of revitalizing the Las Vegas Raiders",
      "HENDERSON, Nev. -- Pete Carroll could be just about anywhere, doing nearly anything that comes to mind, after accomplishing so much as a championship-winning coach in college and the NFL, the multimillion-dollar contracts he received as reward for such efforts.",
      "But after a year away from the NFL, the 74-year-old Carroll chose to return to take on the challenge of turning around a Las Vegas Raiders franchise that has gone more than two decades since coming close to the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cIt isn\u2019t about accomplishing things to say you were worthy,\u201d Carroll said at his introductory news conference in January. \u201cIt\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do next that counts.\u201d",
      "That appears to be a common theme for Carroll and other coaches 70 years and older. They thrive on competition, and a leisurely retirement doesn't seem to be as appealing as drawing up game plans and developing athletes.",
      "Carroll is the only NFL coach in that age range, though Kansas City's Andy Reid, at 67, isn't far behind.",
      "There are a number of other notable septuagenarians not only still coaching, but doing so at a high level.",
      "Geno Auriemma, 71, led the Connecticut women\u2019s basketball team to the NCAA title last season, the Huskies\u2019 12th under his watch.",
      "Kelvin Sampson, who turns 70 on Sunday, coached the Houston basketball team that came within a final possession of winning the national championship last season. Proven winners St. John's Rick Pitino (73), Michigan State's Tom Izzo (70) and Tennessee's Rick Barnes (71) are all back for another season.",
      "Seventy-year-old Kirk Ferentz has led Iowa football since 1999, and North Carolina is under the direction of rookie college coach Bill Belichick, the 73-year-old six-time Super Bowl champion at New England.",
      "Dusty Baker, since retired, was 73 when he managed Houston to the World Series title in 2022. Stanford women's basketball coach and Hall of Famer Tara VanDerveer retired last year at 70.",
      "Robert W. Turner II, associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine and Center of Aging, said successful older coaches have an advantage over most of the population largely because they have been well-compensated over the years.",
      "\"People are living longer, but then there are people who have means,\u201d said Turner, who played college and pro football. \u201cThose are people who are economically, educationally, environmentally have the resources to help them live healthier and longer. So as long as they have the mental acuity, there's no reason they have to pull out of the job market.\u201d",
      "Coaches aren't the only ones working later in life.",
      "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people 50 and older make up about a third of the work force and those 65 and older account for roughly 6%.",
      "Carly Roszkowski, AARP\u2019s vice president of financial resilience, said workers 75 and older are \u201cthe fastest-growing segment of the work force,\u201d and are projected to be 11.7% of the labor market in 2030.",
      "She said falling birthrates mean that by 2034, there will be more workers 65 and older than 18 and younger, and Roszkowski added many workers fear not having adequate retirement savings.",
      "But while an AARP survey showed that 98% of older workers continued to remain employed for financial reasons, 88% also wanted \u201cto feel useful\u201d and 86% liked the idea of staying active.",
      "\u201cPeople are staying healthier longer,\u201d Roszkowski said. \u201dWe know that continuing to work has a lot of health benefits. You're staying out of that social isolation. You're staying mobile with having a job. For most people, you're commuting or going into a place. You've moving around. You're continuing to use your brain.\u201d",

      "Turner said because Black men don't get many head coaching opportunities, it narrows the chances of them working in the field later in life.",
      "\u201cWith those that do get the opportunity, I think there's strong evidence that they get a much shorter leash than white coaches,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd they get fewer second, third and fourth chances than white coaches.\"",
      "Women also appear less likely to coach late in life, with someone like VanDerveer being a rarity.",
      "\"What was the size of her peer group like when she started?\u201d Turner said. \u201cThen over the years, we know that peer group she came from started to dwindle for lots of different reasons. In basketball, she's what we would call a super ager. She's been super successful. She's been able to take care of herself. But she (was) working in an environment where they appreciate her.\u201d",
      "VanDerveer captured three national championships at Stanford, won 1,216 games (behind only Auriemma) and coached the U.S. to Olympic gold in 1996.",
      "Showing her ability to relate to younger players, VanDerveer won her most recent national title just five years ago.",
      "\u201cAge never has been the defining factor in my building of relationships with players,\u201d VanDerveer said in an email. \u201cThe key throughout my career has been focusing on helping each player achieve their goals.

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Democrats kept their promise to reject any Republican spending bill that didn\u2019t extend or restore health care benefits, choosing instead to force a government shutdown. Now they have to figure out how to get out of it.",
      "Just hours after the shutdown began, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said that if the Republicans work with them, \u201cthe shutdown could go away very quickly.\u201d",
      "But that won\u2019t be easy. Republican leaders \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Speaker Mike Johnson and President Donald Trump \u2014 have said that they won\u2019t negotiate or be \u201cheld hostage \u201d by Democrats demanding concessions to reopen the government. The bill Democrats voted against was a simple extension of funding for 45 days, legislation they say should be noncontroversial.",
      "While that uncompromising Republican position may not last long \u2014 there were some early, informal talks on the Senate floor Wednesday \u2014 reaching a deal would be difficult. It\u2019s deeply uncertain, for now, if the two sides could find common ground on health care policy or sow enough trust for the Democrats to change their position.",
      "At the same time, an extended shutdown could be increasingly painful for Democrats. The Trump administration has threatened to lay off thousands of workers and target Democratic-leaning states. On Wednesday, the White House announced it was putting a hold on subway and tunnel projects in Schumer\u2019s home state of New York.",
      "\u201cThis Democrat shutdown is actually delaying progress on the issues that Democrats claim to be interested in,\u201d Thune, who represents South Dakota, said on the Senate floor Wednesday.",
      "Republicans were encouraged Tuesday evening when three Democrats voted with them to keep the government open \u2014 Democratic Sens. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine.",
      "Republicans, who hold the majority, need eight Democrats to win the 60 votes needed for passage in the 53-47 Senate. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul was the only Republican to vote with Democrats against the measure.",
      "Thune is holding repeated votes on the measure, which failed 55-45 on Tuesday night and again Wednesday morning. He said he hopes that five Democrats will eventually feel the pressure and support the bill \u201cwhen they realize that this is playing a losing hand.\u201d",
      "Republicans are eyeing several moderate Democrats who appeared to be wavering before casting \u201cno\u201d votes on Tuesday night, including Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both voted to keep the government open in March, along with Schumer, while many of their colleagues voted for a shutdown.",
      "But Shaheen and Peters each voted no on Tuesday after extensive negotiations with colleagues in both parties on the floor. Shaheen said afterward that \u201cI have been in intensive conversations with colleagues from both sides of the aisle on how to find a path forward and I\u2019m eager to work with my Republican colleagues to find common ground.\u201d",
      "As some Democrats are already looking for a way out, others say they need to dig in and fight.",
      "\u201cAs Donald Trump\u2019s lawlessness grows during this shutdown, our spines should stiffen, not bend,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a social media post on Wednesday. \u201cLet\u2019s stand for something. The American people don\u2019t want us to fund the destruction of their health care and the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The divisions in the caucus pose a dilemma for Schumer, who was blasted by base voters and activists in March when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open. Many Democrats in the House and Senate have suggested that shutting down the government is their only leverage to fight Trump and push back on his policies, including health care and spending cuts.",
      "\u201cStanding up to (Trump) on this is sending a message to him on those other issues as well,\u201d said Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn.",
      "Democrats have demanded that Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies for people who purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. The expanded subsidies first put in place in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic are set to expire at the end of the year, raising premium costs for millions of people.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government shut down Wednesday, with Democratic lawmakers insisting that any deal address their health care demands and Republicans saying those negotiations can happen after the government is funded.",
      "At issue are tax credits that have made health insurance more affordable for millions of people since the COVID-19 pandemic. The subsidies, which go to low- and middle-income people who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, are slated to expire at the end of the year if Congress doesn't extend them. Their expiration would more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit that researches health care issues.",
      "Democrats have demanded that the subsidies, first put in place in 2021 and extended a year later, be extended again. They also want any government funding bill to reverse the Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump'smega-bill passed this summer, which don't go into effect immediately but are already driving some states to cut Medicaid payments to health providers.",
      "Some Republicans have expressed an openness to extending the tax credits, acknowledging many of their constituents will see steep hikes in insurance premiums. But the party's lawmakers in Congress argue negotiations over health care will take time, and a stopgap measure to get the government funded is a more urgent priority.",
      "A record 24 million people have signed up for insurance coverage through the ACA, in large part because billions of dollars in subsidies have made the plans more affordable for many people.",
      "With the expanded subsidies in place, some lower-income enrollees can get health care with no premiums, and high earners pay no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners is also expanded.",
      "When the tax credits expire at the end of 2025, enrollees across the income spectrum will see costs spike. Annual out-of-pocket premiums are estimated to increase by 114% \u2014 an average of $1,016 \u2014 next year, according to the KFF analysis.",

      "The Environmental Protection Agency faces challenges during a government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency was already reeling from massive stuff cuts and dramatic shifts in priority and policy. A government shutdown raises new questions about how it can carry out its founding mission of protecting America's health and environment with little more than skeletal staff and funding.",
      "In President Donald Trump's second term, the EPA has leaned hard into an agenda of deregulation and facilitating Trump's boosting of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to meet what he has called an energy emergency.",
      "Jeremy Symons, a former EPA policy official under President Bill Clinton, said it's natural to worry that a shutdown will lead \u201cthe worst polluters\u201d to treat it as a chance to dump toxic pollution without getting caught.",
      "\u201cNobody will be holding polluters accountable for what they dump into the air we breathe, in the water we drink while EPA is shut down,\u201d said Symons, now a senior adviser to the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former agency officials advocating for a strong Earth-friendly department.",
      "\u201cThis administration has already been implementing a serial shutdown of EPA,\u201d Symons said. \u201cWhittling away at EPA\u2019s ability to do its job.\u201d",
      "A scientific study of pollution from about 200 coal-fired power plants during the 2018-2019 government shutdown found they \u201csignificantly increased their particulate matter emissions due to the EPA's furlough.\u201d Soot pollution is connected to thousands of deaths per year in the United States.",
      "The EPA was created under Republican President Richard Nixon in 1970 amid growing fears about pollution of the planet's air, land and water. Its first administrator, William D. Ruckelshaus, spoke of the need for an \u201cenvironmental ethic\u201d in his first speech.",
      "\u201cEach of us must begin to realize our own relationship to the environment,\" Ruckelshaus said. \"Each of us must begin to measure the impact of our own decisions and actions on the quality of air, water, and soil of this nation.\u201d",
      "In the time since then, it has focused on safeguarding and cleaning up the environment, and over the past couple of decades, it also added fighting climate change to its charge.",
      "EPA's job is essentially setting up standards for what\u2019s healthy for people and the environment, giving money to state and local governments to get that done and then coming down as Earth\u2019s police officer if it isn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cProtecting human health and the environment is critical to the country\u2019s overall well-being,\" said Christine Todd Whitman, who was EPA chief under Republican President George W. Bush. \"Anything that stops that regulatory process puts us at a disadvantage and endangers the public.\u201d",

Right behind it is to \u201crestore American energy dominance,\" followed by environmental permitting reform, making U.S. the capital of artificial intelligence and protecting American auto jobs.",
      "Zeldin is seeking to rescind a 2009 science-based finding that climate change is a threat to America's health and well-being. Known as the \u201cendangerment\u201d finding, it forms the foundation of a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources. Zeldin also has proposed ending a requirement that large, mostly industrial polluters report their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, canceled billions of dollars in solar energy grants and eliminated a research and development division.",
      "The EPA's shutdown contingency plan, first written a decade ago and slightly updated for this year, says 905 employees are considered essential because they are necessary to protect life and property or because they perform duties needed by law. An additional 828 employees can keep working because they aren't funded by the annual federal budget and instead get their pay from fees and such.",
      "EPA officials won't say how many employees they have cut \u2014 former officials now at the Environmental Protection Network say it's 25% \u2014 but the Trump administration's budget plan says the agency now has 14,130 employees, down 1,000 from a year ago. The administration is proposing cutting that to 12,856 in this upcoming budget year and Zeldin has talked of going to levels of around Ronald Reagan's presidency, which started at around 11,000.",
      "The agency's shutdown plan calls for it to stop doing non-criminal pollution inspections needed to enforce clean air and water rules. It won\u2019t issue new grants to other governmental agencies, update its website, issue new permits, approve state requests dealing with pollution regulations or conduct most scientific research, according to the EPA document. Except in situations where the public health would be at risk, work on Superfund cleanup sites will stop.",
      "Marc Boom, a former EPA policy official during the Biden administration, said inspections under the Chemical Accident Risk Reduction program would halt. Those are done under the Clean Air Act to make sure facilities are adequately managing the risk of chemical accidents.",
      "\u201cCommunities near the facilities will have their risk exposure go up immediately since accidents will be more likely to occur,\u201d Boom said.",
      "He also said EPA hotlines for reporting water and other pollution problems likely will be closed. \u201cSo if your water tastes off later this week, there will be no one at EPA to pick up the phone,\" he said.",

      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A single mother who relied on federal food assistance lost her benefits in 2020 after Kentucky investigators concluded she\u2019d committed fraud.",
      "The state alleged she had made multiple same-day purchases, tried to overdraw her account a few times, entered a few invalid PINs and sometimes made \u201cwhole-dollar\u201d purchases that are unlikely during typical grocery runs.",
      "The woman from Salyersville in Appalachian Kentucky had an explanation: She worked at the store. She would sometimes buy lunch there and then get groceries after work. Her child would also occasionally use her card.",
      "An administrative hearing officer kicked her off the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) regardless, based solely on the allegedly suspicious shopping pattern. She sued \u2014 and won.",
      "\u201cIt is draconian to take away SNAP benefits from a single mother without clear and convincing evidence that intentional trafficking was occurring during a time when food scarcity is so prevalent,\u201d Franklin County Judge Thomas Wingate said in his 2023 decision.",
      "Over the last five years, the Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services has brought hundreds of fraud cases that are heavily reliant on transactional data with the goal of revoking people\u2019s food benefits.",
      "Judges, lawyers and legal experts said in interviews and in court documents that such evidence proves little. Kentucky Public Radio reviewed dozens of administrative hearing decisions and court documents from the last five years in which the cabinet relied on shopping patterns to prove a person had \u201ctrafficked,\u201d or sold, their benefits.",
      "Kentucky is so aggressive in disqualifying people from SNAP benefits that the state is second in the nation for per-capita administrative disqualifications, behind Florida, according to the most recent federal data from 2023.",
      "In the last decade, disqualifications in Kentucky rose from fewer than 100 in 2015 to over 1,800 in 2023. And more than 300 others have been accused of selling or misusing their benefits since January 2024, according to records obtained by Kentucky Public Radio.",
      "Another Franklin County judge in 2023 ordered the cabinet to stop disqualifying individuals based solely on transactional data, but since the decision, at least three lawsuits allege the health agency continues to bring such cases.",
      "Transactional data alone cannot prove intent to commit fraud nor show the actual result of any individual transaction, University of Kentucky law professor Cory Dodds said, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that folks didn\u2019t do it, didn\u2019t commit the fraud, but I don\u2019t think the cabinet in a lot of these cases has met their burden of proof, either.\u201d",
      "Kentuckians receive notice of their alleged suspicious activity through mailed letters, in which they\u2019re asked to voluntarily waive their right to a hearing and automatically accept the punishment. On first offense, that\u2019s generally a one-year SNAP ban. They\u2019re also required to repay the full amount the state says they misused.",
      "Often, these cases involve a relatively small amount of money. Records show that more than 900 people have been kicked off for \u201ctrafficking\u201d or misuse for less than $1,000 since 2022. The lowest amount alleged was 14 cents.",
      "The state has leaned heavily on administrative hearing waivers since 2015, and by 2023, almost a quarter of all disqualifications were via waiver. Some lawsuits allege individuals did not fully understand the consequences of the waivers and were encouraged to sign by officials.",
      "Kentucky Public Radio reviewed more than two dozen cases since 2020 in which the cabinet accused an individual of trafficking using only spending patterns, despite the participants\u2019 denial or lack of response \u2014 and with no other evidence or interviews presented, according to administrative hearing decisions.",
      "Kendra Steele, a spokesperson for the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, declined to schedule an interview with cabinet officials after multiple requests. Steele said in an email that \u201cwe have never\u201d brought trafficking cases based solely on transactional data and acknowledged it would not be sufficient to prove intent.",
      "In response to a different question, Steele wrote the investigation into fraud allegations consists of looking into income, living situations \u201cand patterns of spending that are indicative of trafficking.\u201d She did not indicate how any of those factors could be used to prove intentional misuse or selling of SNAP benefits, or how it differs from relying on transactional data \u2014 which is inherently a pattern of spending. Steele said in another email that they also interview vendors and SNAP recipients.",
      "Roughly 4 in 25 Kentuckians suffer from food insecurity, similar to the national rate of about 14%, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The USDA will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d The decision comes in the wake of federal funding cuts for food and nutrition safety net programs nationwide.",
      "In the last fiscal year, 1 in 8 Kentuckians benefitted from SNAP, formerly called food stamps. Food insecurity in Kentucky\u2019s rural areas is even more stark, and legal representation harder to come by.",
      "\u201cThe people who benefit from these programs are some of the folks that we need to be helping the most in this country,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cIt\u2019s our fellow Kentuckians who are going hungry as a result of baseless allegations of waste, fraud and abuse.\u201d",

But administrative hearing decisions reviewed by KPR from 2020 through 2023 included evidence the cabinet relied on; hearing officers would frequently say a person had trafficked their benefits based on shopping patterns the state deemed suspicious.",

      "Kristie Goff, an AppalRed legal aid lawyer in Prestonsburg in southeast Kentucky, used to see many of these cases, though they\u2019ve declined in the last year.",
      "\u201cThere have been very few instances in cases I have handled, where a client was not able to give me a perfectly reasonable explanation for those transactions, and none of it was trafficking,\u201d Goff said. \u201cThere are no receipts, there\u2019s no video footage to show that someone\u2019s doing anything wrong. It\u2019s just a number written on a paper.\u201d",
      "While saying purchasing history is insufficient to prove trafficking, Kentucky judges have stopped short of demanding that the state change how it trains employees or conducts its SNAP investigations.",
      "In response to an open records request, the cabinet provided KPR with documents used to train investigators on intentional program violations. They appear to almost exclusively discuss transactional data, including investigating back-to-back payments, large transactions and whole-dollar purchases.",
      "In 2020, Michigan appellate judges decided transactional data alone is never sufficient to prove that a business \u2014 or person \u2014 fraudulently used SNAP benefits.",
      "Dodds believes that should be the standard for all states, including Kentucky.",
      "He is in the early stages of systematically reviewing thousands of SNAP benefit trafficking hearing decisions between 2020 and 2023. Data from about 700 decisions in 2020 alone already shows that many Kentuckians have been denied benefits before the state presents what he considers real evidence of guilt.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a handful of cases that I would say there was real evidence that they had done something wrong,\u201d Dodds said. \u201cThere was one where a woman was on the phone with the hearing officer while she was actively trying to sell her benefits. ... But cases with non-transactional data are exceedingly rare.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "\u201cThey make it really wholesome and fibrous,\u201d Chris Redfearn said. \u201cIt mimics most of the health-conscious breads that are out there.\u201d",
      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "\u201cTherapy is more than just word exchanges,\u201d Treto said. \"It requires empathy, it requires clinical judgment, it requires ethical responsibility, none of which AI can truly replicate right now.\u201d",
      "In March, a Dartmouth University-based team published the first known randomized clinical trial of a generative AI chatbot for mental health treatment.",
      "The goal was to have the chatbot, called Therabot, treat people diagnosed with anxiety, depression or eating disorders. It was trained on vignettes and transcripts written by the team to illustrate an evidence-based response.",
      "The study found users rated Therabot similar to a therapist and had meaningfully lower symptoms after eight weeks compared with people who didn't use it. Every interaction was monitored by a human who intervened if the chatbot\u2019s response was harmful or not evidence-based.",
      "Nicholas Jacobson, a clinical psychologist whose lab is leading the research, said the results showed early promise but that larger studies are needed to demonstrate whether Therabot works for large numbers of people.",
      "\u201cThe space is so dramatically new that I think the field needs to proceed with much greater caution that is happening right now,\u201d he said.",
      "Many AI apps are optimized for engagement and are built to support everything users say, rather than challenging peoples\u2019 thoughts the way therapists do. Many walk the line of companionship and therapy, blurring intimacy boundaries therapists ethically would not.",

      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries.

      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, says the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S. \u2014 as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",

      "Maine has one of New England\u2019s highest food insecurity rates",
      "WINTERPORT, Maine -- Phylis Allen spends her days looking for things. She searches for potatoes at Sam\u2019s Club, cheap beets and ginger at Walmart and a local grocery store. She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",
      "The diminutive 78-year-old food pantry director found them in a huge cooler. Stretching, she pulled two huge boxes off the top shelf \u2014 seven dozen eggs each, $21 a box. \u201c$2.82 a dozen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s a good price for eggs.\u201d",
      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture will stop collecting and releasing statistics on food insecurity after October, saying on Sept. 20 that the numbers had become \u201coverly politicized.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration cut more than $1 billion from two U.S. Department of Agriculture programs \u2014 the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provides free food to food banks nationwide, and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which provides funds to state, territorial and tribal governments to purchase food from local farmers for distribution to hunger relief organizations.",
      "\u201cI can watch the availability of federal food going down every month,\u201d Allen said.",
      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",
      "Anna Korsen, who co-chairs the Ending Hunger in Maine advisory committee, said food pantries alone aren\u2019t the answer to food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIf our goal is to end hunger in Maine, which is a lofty goal, then we\u2019re not going to do that through a charitable food network that\u2019s run by volunteers, right?\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s supposed to be for crisis situations \u2026 but what has happened is that it is just a part of the food system now. It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",
      "\u201cYou see a lot of people you know,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody\u2019s name, but I don\u2019t need a name. I just look at their faces.\u201d",
      "Younger volunteers can be harder to come by than affordable eggs. About 35% of Mainers volunteer \u2014 the third-highest rate in the nation, according to a 2024 report on the state of Maine\u2019s civic health. But just 20% of millennials volunteer in Maine, half the rate of Gen Xers and baby boomers, the same report said.",
      "It\u2019s not a lack of desire to serve, but obstacles in the way, said researcher Quixada Moore-Vissing, an author of the report.",
      "\u201cI would categorize it as being an overwhelmed and overworked society,\u201d Moore-Vissing said. \u201cThe rising costs of everything, and in particular the cost of housing, means that people have to work more.\"",

      "The Patriots represent Babi\u0161's refusal of EU policies on migration and climate change and support for the protection of national sovereignty.",
      "Babi\u0161 has denied sharing the pro-Russian stance of many members of the group, but questioned a Czech initiative that uses the country\u2019s long-term global contacts to acquire artillery shells for Ukraine on markets outside the EU. He has also refused to fully endorse a NATO commitment to significantly increase defense spending.",

      "Babi\u0161 would prefer to rule alone, but polls predict he could win with some 30% vote. That would be about 10% more than Fiala\u2019s coalition but not enough to form a majority government.",

      "His potential partners include two coalitions that are openly pro-Russian and want to lead the country out of the EU and NATO. Babi\u0161 declared that was not his intention. Another potential ally, a right-wing group calling itself the Motorists that is backed by former Euro-skeptic President V\u00e1clav Klaus, has vowed to reject the EU\u2019s environment policies.",

      "A person cannot nominate themselves, though they can be nominated multiple times by others \u2014 including members of each prize's panel.",

      "But it\u2019s not the most transparent of processes. There is no published shortlist of candidates, nor an open vote. It\u2019s more a slow process of sounding out various interest groups to figure out which of the current bishops might be able to lead the church forward.",

      "Georgia has been facing a wave of protests against its government's repressive policies",
      "TBILISI, Georgia -- TBILISI, Georgia (AP) \u2014 Almost every day for nearly a year, Gota Chanturia has joined rallies at Georgia\u2019s parliament against the government and its increasingly repressive policies. He's done this despite mass arrests and police violence against demonstrators.",
      "And the civics teacher keeps marching even though he's racked up an astonishing $102,000 in fines from the protests. That's about 10 times what the average Georgian earns in a year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve said that we will be here until the end, and we\u2019re still here,\u201d Chanturia told The Associated Press as he participated in yet another demonstration this week in the capital of Tbilisi.",
      "The protests began when the government halted talks about joining the European Union. That move came after the longtime ruling party Georgian Dream won an election that the opposition alleged was rigged.",
      "The rallies, big and small, continue despite a multipronged crackdown by the government through laws that target demonstrators, rights groups, nongovernmental organizations and independent media.",
      "More protests are planned for this weekend to coincide with local elections.",
      "The repression in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million has drawn comparisons to Georgia\u2019s powerful neighbor and former imperial ruler Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has stifled dissent. Georgian Dream has been accused of steering the country into Moscow\u2019s orbit of influence.",
      "Human Rights Watch says Georgia is suffering a \u201crights crisis.\u201d The clampdown is unprecedented in the country's independent history and is escalating steadily, said Giorgi Gogia, the group's Europe and Central Asia associate director.",
      "But Georgia\u2019s vibrant civil society is pushing back, and it has become a question of \u201cwho would blink first,\u201d Gogia said. If it's the public and civil society, they could wake up in an authoritarian country, \"which would be a huge transformation from what Georgia used to be up until now,\u201d he added.",
      "Ketuna Kerashvili joined a rally in rainy Tbilisi on Wednesday despite the fact that her 30-year-old brother Irakli was arrested in December, convicted of disrupting public order, and sentenced to two years in prison. He had rejected the charges as unfounded.",
      "Kerashvili told AP her brother's trial was \u201ctough to watch.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of those boys and girls who are in prison now were trying to protect our country from pro-Russian forces and a pro-Russian government,\u201d she said.",
      "The violent crackdown escalated after largely peaceful protests in late November 2024, with over 400 people detained within two weeks; at least 300 reported severe beatings and other ill-treatment, according to Amnesty International. The group alleged much of the brutality occurs out of sight in detention.",
      "Between April 2024 and August 2025, at least 76 people have faced criminal prosecution in the protests, with more than 60 imprisoned, according to Transparency International Georgia, an anti-corruption organization. The number of prosecutions is likely higher now, and scores more people have been slapped with steep fines.",
      "Chanturia said he was fined 56 times for allegedly blocking a road \u2013- a common charge levied against protesters. He said he hasn't paid them and doesn't intend to. Under new regulations, failing to do so could land him in jail.",
      "HRW's Gogia says it's hard to estimate how many people have been fined, but he estimates it could be thousands. The penalties are issued via automation, like highway tolls and traffic fines, with authorities using surveillance cameras with facial recognition.",
      "Sometimes those penalized weren't protesting but just happened to be at the rally. Mariam Nikuradze, a prominent journalist and co-founder of the independent news site OC Media, has accrued 20,000 lari (about $7,300) in fines, after being cited four times for allegedly blocking a road. She said she was merely covering the demonstrations.",
      "Javid Ahmedov, a journalism student from Azerbaijan, told AP he was filming at a July protest when the cameras spotted him. He learned he had been fined 10,000 lari (about $3,700) upon returning to Georgia last month to complete his studies at the Georgian Institute of Public Affairs.",

      "A decade after 1 million migrants arrived in Germany from war-torn countries like Syria, Iran and Afghanistan, the country has changed",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Nearly a decade after fleeing Syria's civil war, Rahaf Alshaar sat on her couch in a leafy suburb of Berlin sipping Arabic coffee spiced with cardamom.",
      "When she, her husband and their three daughters arrived in Germany as refugees, they adapted quickly to their new country: learning the language, finding jobs and attending school.",
      "\u201cIt was a lot of hard work, but I\u2019m proud of what we achieved,\u201d Alshaar, 44, told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "Earlier this year, the whole family became German citizens and bought a house with a nice garden.",
      "\u201cWe are Germans,\u201d said 52-year-old Basem Wahbeh, Alshaar's husband.",
      "Their family arrived among an influx of migrants from war-torn Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan who took refuge in Germany, peaking at more than 1 million in 2015. The arrival of so many asylum-seekers in a single year strained the country's resources and brought consequences that Germany is still wrestling with a decade later, most notably the rise of far-right anti-immigration parties.",
      "Even though the family\u2019s integration into German society was a success, it was not without sacrifice. They and many others had to leave behind their homes, culture and language, sometimes shedding traditions dear to them.",
      "On Aug. 31, 2015, as Europe faced what was by then being called the refugee crisis, Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany's borders to migrants. Facing criticism at home and abroad, Merkel famously promised citizens that \u201cwe will manage it.\u201d",
      "Refugees were initially welcomed with applause as they arrived at train stations. German families opened their homes to put them up for months as overwhelmed cities struggled to find accommodation.",
      "In a massive effort, schools and community colleges quickly created tens of thousands of \u201cwelcome classes\u201d for children and integration classes for adults to help them study German, get a job and find a home in their new country.",
      "\u201cA lot of things worked out surprisingly well,\u201d said Jonas Wiedner, an expert on migration from the Berlin Social Science Center.",
      "He noted migrants' employment figures compare roughly to those of Germans, politicians acted quickly to offer help and money to local communities integrating the new arrivals and \"civil society was very involved from the outset and has really achieved great things.\u201d",
      "Germany became the top asylum destination in Europe, with its total population rising by 1.2% in 2015 \u2014 the highest since 1992 \u2014 because of immigration, according to the Federal Statistical Office.",
      "Over time, as more asylum-seekers arrived looking for better prospects, not necessarily fleeing danger, the surge of immigration fueled economic anxieties and xenophobic resentment among some Germans.",
      "Before the outbreak of Syria's civil war in 2011, the Wahbeh family had a good life. He worked for many years at a company that made cookies, chocolate and juices while his wife raised their daughters. But as the war intensified, so did concerns about their family's safety.",
      "In December 2012, a bomb hit oldest daughter Rajaa's elementary school while she was in class. She wasn't injured, but the close call convinced them to leave.",
      "\u201cNo more school. We have to leave,\u201d Alshaar told her husband.",

      "Determined to succeed, they enrolled in German classes and initially took internships to get into the job market. Alshaar, who is a civil engineer by training, found a stable job at the transportation ministry and put her three daughters in a good high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really proud, and I was also lucky to have good people around me,\u201d Germans who helped them as refugees and have become good family friends, Alshaar said. But she also encountered hostility as a foreigner, specifically for wearing a hijab.",
      "Anger over migration has propelled the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, which would be the second largest party if an election were held today, according to polls. Voters elsewhere in Europe have increasingly been empowering far-right nationalist parties that promise to restrict immigration.",
      "\u201cIt is a highly contentious political issue and has repeatedly provided ammunition for the far right,\u201d Wiedner said.",
      "In a recent poll that asked how well Germany \u201ccoped overall with the influx of almost 1.5 million refugees between 2015 and 2020,\u201d only 21% answered \u201cgood,\u201d 41% said \u201cless good\u201d and 37% said \u201cnot at all.\u201d The data were collected by Forsa Institute on behalf of RTL Germany from Aug. 22 to 25. They questioned 1,006 people and the margin of error was plus/minus 3 percentage points.",
      "During Germany's election campaign at the beginning of this year, AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, called for closing the borders to undocumented migration and large-scale deportations of asylum-seekers, making clear she has no problem with the politically charged term \u201cremigration.\u201d",
      "Though many Germans have expressed their outrage in protests against the anti-immigration stance of the AfD, Chancellor Friedrich Merz from the center-right Christian Democrats also campaigned on the promise of ending \u201cuncontrolled migration.\u201d Once the new government was in power, it quickly boosted border controls to curb migration to Germany and started to speed up deportations of rejected and criminal asylum-seekers.",
      "Alshaar said she has been watching the rise of the far right with concern but at the same time doesn't want to let herself be intimidated because she feels her family has done everything right, even if integrating into German society wasn\u2019t always easy.",
      "Germans asked her more than once if she had been forced to wear the hijab. At an appointment on a construction side outside Berlin, Alshaar was shown the middle finger.",
      "Looking at a picture of her arrival in Germany \u2014 after an odyssey from Damascus to Lebanon, Egypt and finally Berlin \u2014 wearing a white headscarf tightly tucked around her face, Alshaar paused, ran a hand through her long, chestnut brown hair and said it took years of internal struggle before she decided to remove the hijab two years ago.",
      "\u201cIt was difficult ... because I had been wearing a headscarf for more than 30 years,\u201d she said.",
      "Her three daughters don't want to wear a hijab. On the contrary, they look German, feel German and speak German without a trace of an accent.",
      "Rajaa, 20, has finished high school and is applying to art schools, Razan, 17, will start her senior year after summer vacation and 13-year-old Raneen, who was elected class representative last year, will be in eighth grade soon.",
      "\u201cMany of my friends didn't even know that I'm from Syria and were surprised when I told them so,\u201d Rajaa said.",
      "The parents are grateful to Germany for giving them a place to rebuild and relieved that their daughters have integrated so well, though Alshaar said it\u2019s important to her that her family still speaks Arabic at home, watches Syrian TV series and celebrates Muslim holidays.",
      "Despite the fall of Bashar Assad\u2019s regime last year, they have no plans to return to their home country. But Alshaar said wistfully that she and her husband will always be homesick for Syria.",
      "\u201cI don't want my daughters to grow up with this feeling of homesickness because it will always make them feel like they're not complete,\u201d she said.",

Kratos, the most senior of the dogs, greeted him with a paw after receiving treats. Then, Lupa settled on the floor and S\u00e1nchez brushed her as he remained seated due to his back injury.",

Despite a 2016 peace agreement between the government and the country\u2019s largest guerrilla group the FARC, various armed groups still operate in Colombia.

      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned the United States that supplies of long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington but will not change the situation on the battlefield",
      "MOSCOW -- Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the United States that supplies of long-range missiles to Ukraine will seriously damage relations between Moscow and Washington but will not change the situation on the battlefield where the Russian army is making slow but steady advances.",
      "The potential supply of U.S. Tomahawk cruise missiles to Kyiv will signal a \u201cqualitatively new stage of escalation, including in relations between Russia and the U.S.,\" Putin said at a forum of foreign policy experts in Russia's Black Sea resort of Sochi.",
      "The Russian leader noted that even though Tomahawk missiles will inflict damage on Russia if supplied to Ukraine, Russian air defenses will quickly adapt to the new threat. \u201cIt will certainly not change the balance of force on the battlefield,\u201d he added, emphasizing that the Russian military is continuously making gains against Ukraine.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin\u2019s remarks.",
      "At the same time, Putin hailed U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to help negotiate peace in Ukraine and described their August summit in Alaska as productive.",
      "\u201cIt was good that we made an attempt to search for and find possible ways to settle the Ukrainian crisis,\u201d he said, adding that he felt \u201ccomfortable\u201d talking to Trump.",
      "While praising Trump and trying to emphasize potential common interests, including nuclear arms control, the Russian president sent a stern warning to Ukraine\u2019s Western allies against trying to seize ships that carry Russian oil to global markers. He argued that would amount to piracy and could trigger a forceful response while sharply destabilizing the global oil market.",
      "Asked about the detention of an oil tanker off France's Atlantic coast, which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions, Putin cast it as an attempt by Macron to distract public attention from his country's own internal problems.",
      "He strongly warned the West against such action, arguing that it defies international maritime law and could trigger a forceful response. \u201cThe risk of confrontation will seriously increase,\" he added.",
      "Putin also scoffed at Western claims of possible Russian involvement in recent drone flights over Denmark, casting them as part of purported NATO efforts to \u201cinflame tensions to boost the defense spending.\u201d",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t do it anymore \u2014 to France, Denmark, Copenhagen, Lisbon \u2014 wherever they could reach,\u201d he said with a sardonic grin.",

      "Putin also praised Michael Gloss, an American and the son of a deputy CIA chief, who joined the Russian military and was killed in action in Ukraine in 2024. He said he had awarded Gloss with a medal, which he handed to Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff during his visit to Moscow.",
      "The Russian leader likened Gloss to Kirk, saying they championed similar \u201ctraditional\u201d values. \"He gave his life while defending those values as a Russian soldier, and Kirk gave his life while fighting for the same values in the United States,\u201d Putin said.",
      "In response to questions about Gloss, the CIA said in a statement that the agency \u201cconsiders Michael\u2019s passing to be a private family matter \u2014 and not a national security issue. The entire CIA family is heartbroken for their loss.\"",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Brazil's lower house has approved exempting up to 5,000 reais ($940) a month from income taxes, which would more than double the current exemption and meet a key priority of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva 's 2022 election campaign.",
      "The bill passed the House unanimously late Wednesday and will now head to the Senate, where Lula said he expects final approval for the measure, which has drawn broad public support.",
      "Lula described the vote on X as: \u201cA victory in favor of tax justice and the fight against inequality in Brazil, benefiting 15 million Brazilian workers.\"",
      "In the bill sent to Congress in March, Lula\u2019s leftist government proposed to offset the loss of state revenue by introducing a minimum effective tax rate for high-income individuals \u2014 a tax that must be paid regardless of the amount of deductions and credits the taxpayer might have.",
      "The new minimum effective tax would apply to people who earn over 600,000 reais (approximately $113,000) a year, ramping up from zero to 10% for those who earn over 1,200,000 reais (some $226,000) annually.",
      "That legislation would target some 141,000 wealthy individuals in the country, who on average currently pay an effective tax rate of 2.5%, according to Brazil\u2019s Finance Ministry.",
      "If the measure passes the Senate, Lula would then sign the reform into law and it would come into effect on Jan. 1. 2026.",
      "The unanimous support for the bill in the lower house \u2014 despite Lula's coalition lacking a majority in the chamber \u2014 reflects the broad public support for the tax exemption and the lack of a coherent opposition to Lula's administration.",
      "Lula is expected to run for reelection next year.",
      "He had been facing plummeting popularity, although he has recovered slightly in recent months as an unintended effect of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s politically-motivated 50% tariff on a range of Brazilian imports. The leftist president\u2019s defense of Brazilian sovereignty has struck a chord in public opinion.",
      "Increasing the income tax exemption could provide a major political victory for Lula and could help peel away on-the-fence voters from the camp of former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, Lula\u2019s principal political opponent, according to Luciana Santana, a political scientist at the Federal University of Alagoas.",
      "\u201cIt will have a big impact on a considerable portion of the population and it\u2019s something the government needs: a policy with broad societal impact,\u201d Santana said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 From Wall Street trading floors to the Federal Reserve to economists sipping coffee in their home offices, the first Friday morning of the month typically brings a quiet hush around 8:30 a.m. eastern as everyone awaits the Labor Department's crucial monthly jobs report.",
      "But with the government shut down, no information was released Friday about hiring in September.",
      "It's the first time since a government shutdown in 2013 that the jobs report has been delayed. During the 2018-2019 partial government closure, the Labor Department was one of several agencies that remained open because Congress had agreed to fund them. September's jobs figures will be released eventually, once the shutdown ends.",
      "The interruption in the data has occurred at a particularly uncertain time, when policymakers at the Federal Reserve and Wall Street investors would need more data on the economy, rather than less. Hiring has ground nearly to a halt, threatening to drag down the broader economy. Yet at the same time, consumers \u2014 particularly higher-income earners \u2014 are still spending and some businesses are ramping up investments in data centers developing artificial intelligence models. Whether that is enough to revive hiring remains to be seen.",
      "For now, economists are turning to alternative measures of the job market provided by nonprofits and private-sector companies. Those measures mostly show a job market with little hiring, but not many layoffs, either. Those who have jobs appear to be mostly secure, while those looking for work are having a tougher time.",

      "VALHALLA, New York -- Pepsi has a new challenge: keeping products like Gatorade and Cheetos vivid and colorful without the artificial dyes that U.S. consumers are increasingly rejecting.",
      "PepsiCo, which also makes Doritos, Cap'n Crunch cereal, Funyuns and Mountain Dew, announced in April that it would accelerate a planned shift to using natural colors in its foods and beverages. Around 40% of its U.S. products now contain synthetic dyes, according to the company.",
      "But just as it took decades for artificial colors to seep into PepsiCo\u2019s products, removing them is likely to be a multi-year process. The company said it\u2019s still finding new ingredients, testing consumers\u2019 responses and waiting for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve natural alternatives. PepsiCo hasn\u2019t committed to meeting the Trump administration\u2019s goal of phasing out petroleum-based synthetic dyes by the end of 2026.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to launch a product that the consumer\u2019s not going to enjoy,\u201d said Chris Coleman, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director for food research and development in North America. \u201cWe need to make sure the product is right.\u201d",
      "Coleman said it can take two or three years to shift a product from an artificial color to a natural one. PepsiCo has to identify a natural ingredient that will have a stable shelf life and not change a product\u2019s flavor. Then it must ensure the availability of a safe and adequate supply. The company tests prototypes with trained experts and panels of consumers, then makes sure the new formula won\u2019t snag its manufacturing process. It also has to design new packaging.",
      "Tostitos and Lay\u2019s will be the first PepsiCo brands to make the shift, with naturally dyed tortilla and potato chips expected on store shelves later this year and naturally dyed dips due to be on sale early next year. Most of the chips, dips and salsas in the two lines already are naturally colored, but there were some exceptions.",
      "The reddish-brown tint of Tostitos Salsa Verde, for example, came from four synthetic colors: Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40 and Blue 1. Coleman said the company is switching to carob powder, which gives the chips a similar color, but needed to tweak the recipe to ensure the addition of the cocoa alternative wouldn\u2019t affect the taste.",
      "In its Frito-Lay food labs and test kitchens in Plano, Texas, PepsiCo is experimenting with ingredients like paprika and turmeric to mimic the bright reds and oranges in products like Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos, Coleman said.",
      "The company is looking at purple sweet potatoes and various types of carrots to color drinks like Mountain Dew and Cherry 7Up, according to Damien Browne, the vice president of research and development for PepsiCo\u2019s beverage division based in Valhalla, New York.",
      "Getting the hue right is critical, since many consumers know products like Gatorade by their color and not necessarily their name, Browne said.",
      "\u201cWe eat with our eyes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at a plate of food, it\u2019s generally the different kinds of colors that will tell you what you would like or not.\u201d",
      "When the Pepsi-Cola Company was founded in 1902, the absence of artificial dyes was a point of pride. The company marketed Pepsi as \u201cThe Original Pure Food Drink\u201d to differentiate the cola from rivals that used lead, arsenic and other toxins as food colorants before the U.S. banned them in 1906.",
      "But synthetic dyes eventually won over food companies. They were vibrant, consistent and cheaper than natural colors. They are also rigorously tested by the FDA.",
      "Still, PepsiCo said it started seeing a small segment of shoppers asking for products without artificial colors or flavors more than two decades ago. In 2002, it launched its Simply line of chips, which offer natural versions of products like Doritos. A dye-free organic Gatorade came out in 2016.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking for those little signals that will become humongous in the future,\u201d Amanda Grzeda, PepsiCo\u2019s senior director of global sensory and consumer experience, said of the company's close attention to consumer preferences.",
      "Grzeda said the whisper PepsiCo detected in the early 2000s has become a roar, fueled by social media and growing consumer interest in ingredients. More than half of the consumers PepsiCo spoke to for a recent internal study said they were trying to reduce their consumption of artificial dyes, Grzeda said.",

      "\u201cConsumers are definitely leading, and I think what we need to do is have the regulators catching up, allowing us to approve new natural ingredients to be able to meet their demand,\u201d he said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it's expediting approval of natural additives after calling on companies to halt their use of synthetic dyes. In May, the FDA approved three new natural color additives, including a blue color derived from algae. In July, the agency approved gardenia blue, which is derived from a flowering evergreen.",
      "The FDA banned one petroleum-based dye, Red 3, in January because it was shown to cause cancer in lab rats. And in September, the agency proposed a ban on Orange B, a synthetic color that hasn't been used in decades.",
      "Six synthetic dyes remain FDA-approved and widely used, despite mixed studies that show they may cause neurobehavioral problems in some children. Red 40, for example, is used in 25,965 food and beverage items on U.S. store shelves, according to the market research firm NIQ.",
      "But even if decades of research has shown that synthetic colors are safe, PepsiCo has to weigh public perceptions, Grzeda said.",
      "\u201cWe could just blindly follow the science, but it probably would put us at odds with what our consumers believe and perceive in the world,\u201d she said.",
      "PepsiCo also has to balance the needs of consumers who don\u2019t want their favorite snacks and drinks to change or get more expensive because of the costs of natural dyes. NIQ data shows that unit sales of products advertised as free of artificial colors fell sharply in 2023 as prices rose.",
      "Susan Mazur-Stommen, a small business owner in Hinton, West Virginia, picked up some Simply brand Cheetos Puffs recently at a convenience store because they were the only variety available. She found the texture to be much different from regular Cheetos Puffs, she said, and their pallid color made them less appetizing.",
      "Mazur-Stommen said she agrees with the move away from petroleum-based dyes, but it\u2019s not a critical issue for her.",
      "\u201cWhat I am looking for is the original formulation,\u201d she said.",
      "Ultimately, PepsiCo does not want customers to have to choose between natural colors and familiar flavors and textures, Grzeda said.",

      "CHICAGO -- CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's administration will withhold $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects, the White House budget director said Friday, expanding funding fights that have targeted Democratic areas during the government shutdown.",
      "The pause affects a long-awaited plan to extend the city\u2019s Red Line train. The money was \u201cput on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting,\u201d budget director Russ Vought wrote on social media.",
      "Vought made a similar announcement earlier this week involving New York, where he said $18 billion for infrastructure would be paused, including funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River.",
      "Trump, a Republican, has embraced Vought\u2019s tactics. On Thursday night, he posted a video depicting him as the reaper, wearing a hood and holding a scythe.",
      "Losing the money would be a significant setback for Chicago\u2019s transportation plans. The Red Line extension is slated to add four train stops on the city\u2019s South Side, improving access for disadvantaged communities.",
      "Rogers Jones, the director of a violence prevention youth center next to the planned Roseland Red Line station, called the delay a severe blow to some of the region\u2019s most disadvantaged areas.",
      "Officials have demolished houses, widened streets, cut grass and put up signs throughout the area in preparation for the new station, he said.",
      "\u201cIf you talk to any neighbors today, they want to curse, because they\u2019ve been anticipating that,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand the Trump administration, bringing harm like that. It\u2019s devastating when people are expecting something good coming and it does not come.\u201d",
      "In addition, a broader modernization project for the Red and Purple lines, which Vought said was also being targeted, is intended to upgrade stations and remove a bottleneck where different lines intersect.",
      "Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley, a Chicago Democrat, criticized the White House\u2019s announcement, calling it \u201ca very bad day for public transit in the country when it becomes weaponized.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was our prized baby and they know it,\u201d Quigley said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThis was the most important new transit project in Chicago in 50 years.\u201d",

      "The suspension of funds for the Hudson River tunnel project and a Second Avenue subway line extension is likely meant to target Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, whom the White House is blaming for the impasse. The New York senator said the funding freeze would harm commuters.",
      "\u201cObstructing these projects is stupid and counterproductive because they create tens of thousands of great jobs and are essential for a strong regional and national economy,\u201d Schumer said on X.",
      "Yonah Freemark, a researcher at the Urban Institute who specializes in transit, said he expects Chicago and New York will now be forced to sue to argue they were simply following federal law in pursuing the projects they won through a competitive grant process.",
      "Even if the cities ultimately prevail, the projects will take much longer and be far more expensive because of the delays, Freemark said. Competitive grant programs such as the ones under the infrastructure law are in place in part to avoid partisan decisions about how governments should divvy up the money, he said.",

      "Federal health officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill, prompting outrage from some abortion opponents aligned with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks.",
      "Students for Life Action, which opposes abortion, in a statement Thursday called the approval \u201ca stain on the Trump presidency and another sign that the deep state at the FDA must go.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri also criticized the move in a post on X, stating, \u201cI have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the agency said the FDA \u201chas very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug,\" and added that FDA officials do not \u201cendorse any product.\u201d",
      "The criticism comes as Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug\u2019s safety.",
      "Under Makary and Kennedy, the FDA has repeatedly delayed decisions on vaccines, ultimately narrowing the terms of approval for this year's COVID-19 shots. That type of political intervention was previously highly unusual at the FDA, where career scientists typically make such decisions.",
      "The FDA approved the original version of mifepristone in 2000 and gradually eased access over time. That included approving the first generic pill, from drugmaker GenBioPro, in 2019.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula used in the original medication.",
      "\u201cThis is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" said Mini Timmaraju of Reproductive Freedom for All. \u201cCareer scientists and civil servants at the FDA did their jobs.\u201d",

      "The company said in an email that the drug is expected to launch in January of next year.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Brazil's lower house has approved exempting up to 5,000 reais ($940) a month from income taxes, which would more than double the current exemption and meet a key priority of President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva 's 2022 election campaign.",

      "Lula described the vote on X as: \u201cA victory in favor of tax justice and the fight against inequality in Brazil, benefiting 15 million Brazilian workers.\"",
      "In the bill sent to Congress in March, Lula\u2019s leftist government proposed to offset the loss of state revenue by introducing a minimum effective tax rate for high-income individuals \u2014 a tax that must be paid regardless of the amount of deductions and credits the taxpayer might have.",
      "The new minimum effective tax would apply to people who earn over 600,000 reais (approximately $113,000) a year, ramping up from zero to 10% for those who earn over 1,200,000 reais (some $226,000) annually.",
      "That legislation would target some 141,000 wealthy individuals in the country, who on average currently pay an effective tax rate of 2.5%, according to Brazil\u2019s Finance Ministry.",
      "If the measure passes the Senate, Lula would then sign the reform into law and it would come into effect on Jan. 1. 2026.",
      "The unanimous support for the bill in the lower house \u2014 despite Lula's coalition lacking a majority in the chamber \u2014 reflects the broad public support for the tax exemption and the lack of a coherent opposition to Lula's administration.",
      "Lula is expected to run for reelection next year.",
      "He had been facing plummeting popularity, although he has recovered slightly in recent months as an unintended effect of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s politically-motivated 50% tariff on a range of Brazilian imports. The leftist president\u2019s defense of Brazilian sovereignty has struck a chord in public opinion.",
      "Increasing the income tax exemption could provide a major political victory for Lula and could help peel away on-the-fence voters from the camp of former right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, Lula\u2019s principal political opponent, according to Luciana Santana, a political scientist at the Federal University of Alagoas.",
      "\u201cIt will have a big impact on a considerable portion of the population and it\u2019s something the government needs: a policy with broad societal impact,\u201d Santana said.",

      "The 10-year yield was at 4.10% at midday Thursday, down from 4.19% the same time last week. Much of that decline has come in the past few days, driven by discouraging reports on the U.S. economy, particularly the job market.",

      "The housing market has been in a slump since 2022, when mortgage rates began climbing from historic lows. Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank last year to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. So far this year, sales are running below where they were at this time in 2024.",

Since it completed the CrownRock acquisition in December 2023, Occidental has sold off roughly $4 billion worth of assets to help it pay down $7.5 billion in debt. This OxyChem deal will accelerate that.",

      "French authorities have announced the captain of an oil tanker linked to Russia's shadow fleet will face trial in February",
      "PARIS -- The captain of an oil tanker immobilized off the country\u2019s Atlantic coast which President Emmanuel Macron linked to Russia will go on trial in February over the crew's alleged refusal to cooperate, a French prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Macron has alleged that the tanker belongs to Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet of aging tankers of uncertain ownership that are avoiding Western sanctions over Moscow\u2019s war in Ukraine and didn't rule out that it could have been involved in drone flights over Denmark as it was sailing last week off the coast of the Nordic country.",
      "Asked about whether the tanker could be linked to drones flights, Macron said that \u201cI\u2019m very cautious because our services and our justice are still working ... I don\u2019t exclude it at all, but I cannot here attribute very clearly and establish a clear link between these two phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Speaking at a European summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, Macron said that the French navy faced \u201cinappropriate and extremely aggressive behavior\u201d towards the French frigate and helicopters that had been deployed to board the taker, which justified the opening of a judicial investigation.",
      "St\u00e9phane Kellenberger, prosecutor of the western port city of Brest, said that two Chinese crew members, the captain and the chief mate, who had been detained since Tuesday, were released from police custody. The chief mate has been released without charge.",
      "A preliminary investigation was opened into the crew\u2019s \u201crefusal to cooperate\u201d and \u201cfailure to justify the nationality of the vessel\u201d after the Atlantic Maritime Prefect alerted justice authorities Monday, Kellenberger said. The inquiry showed the captain couldn't be directly considered responsible for the second offense, he added.",
      "Kellenberger said that members of the French navy intervened and boarded the ship on Saturday off France's Atlantic coast in line with international law when there appeared to be a discrepancy between its apparent nationality and real nationality.",
      "An investigation led by the French navy concluded that the ship, coming from Russia and heading to India with a \u201clarge oil shipment,\u201d was flying no flag, he said.",
      "The captain was summoned for trial in Brest on Feb. 23. He faces up to one year in prison and a 150,000-euro ($176,000) fine.",
      "French military spokesman Col. Guillaume Vernet said that the ship was ordered to stay in place in a safe area.",
      "In comments earlier Thursday in Copenhagen, Macron praised the work of the French navy to \u201cidentify the presence of a shadow fleet.\"",
      "\u201cYou kill the business model by detaining even for days or weeks these vessels and forcing them to organize themselves differently,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIt represents more than 30 billion euros. So it\u2019s extremely important to increase the pressure on this shadow fleet, because it will clearly reduce the capacity to finance this war effort for Russia,\u201d he said.",
      "Macron said the ship was \u201cexactly the same\u201d one which was detained by Estonia earlier this year for the same flag issue.",
      "In April, Estonian public broadcaster EE reported that the ship, then identified under the name \u201cKiwala,\u201d was stopped outside Tallinn Bay on way to the Russian port of Ust-Luga. At the time, Prime Minister Kristen Michal posted on social media that Estonia\u2019s navy had \u201cdetained a sanctioned vessel with no flag state\u201d and authorities had boarded the ship -- without specifying.",
      "The ship, now known as \u201cPushpa\u201d or \u201cBoracay,\u201d left the Russian oil terminal in Primorsk near St. Petersburg on Sept. 20, and sailed off the coast of Denmark. It has stayed off the coast of the French western port of Saint-Nazaire since Sunday, according to the Marine Traffic monitoring website.",
      "The tanker, whose name has changed several times, was sailing under the flag of Benin and appears on a list of ships targeted by European Union sanctions against Russia.",
      "Asked by journalists about it, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said that he had \u201cno information\u201d on the ship. He also said that many countries were carrying out \u201cprovocative actions\u201d against Russia.",
      "The shadow fleet is made up of used, aging tankers that were often bought by nontransparent entities with addresses from countries that haven't sanctioned Russia. Their role is to help Russia\u2019s oil exporters elude the price cap imposed by Ukraine\u2019s allies.",

      "\u201cFatih Altayli has launched a new form of journalism: prison journalism,\u201d fellow journalist Murat Yetkin, wrote on his news website, Yetkin Report. \u201cDrawing on visits from legislators, letters, and his lawyers \u2014 he continues his journalism uninterrupted, conveying not only information from inside but also insights about the outside world.\u201d",
      "Altayli, whose YouTube program attracts hundreds of thousands of views daily, was arrested in June on charges of threatening President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, an accusation he strongly denies. Critics say his arrest, which comes amid a deepening crackdown on the opposition, was aimed at silencing a government critic.",
      "Prosecutors accuse Altayli of issuing and publicly disseminating a threat, a criminal charge under Turkish penal law, and are seeking a minimum five-year prison sentence. The first hearing of the trial is set for Friday.",
      "The charges stem from a comment he made on his YouTube program, \u201cFatih Altayli Comments,\u201d following a recent poll that reportedly showed more than 70% of the public opposed a lifetime presidency for Erdogan, who has been in power for more than two decades.",
      "On the show, Altayli said he wasn\u2019t surprised by the results of the poll and that the Turkish people preferred checks on authority.",
      "\u201cLook at the history of this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a nation which strangled its sultan when they didn\u2019t like him or want him. There are quite a few Ottoman sultans who were assassinated, strangled, or whose deaths were made to look like suicide.\u201d",

      "Officials say two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided on the taxiway at LaGuardia Airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant",
      "Two Delta Air Lines regional jets collided on the taxiway at LaGuardia Airport in New York, injuring a flight attendant, damaging a cockpit and tearing off part of a wing in what the airline described as a \u201clow-speed collision.\u201d",
      "An aircraft carrying 32 people was preparing for takeoff Wednesday night to Roanoke, Virginia, when its wing made contact with the fuselage of an aircraft arriving from Charlotte, North Carolina, with 61 people aboard, according to a statement from Delta.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear who was at fault, but air traffic control had instructed the Virginia-bound plane \u201cto hold short and yield to the other aircraft\u201d before the collision, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement.",
      "A flight attendant was taken to a hospital, according to a statement from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. One of the pilots told the tower that the flight attendant told him she hit her knee when the planes collided, according to audio that www.LiveATC.net posted. There were no reports of passengers injured, the airline said.",
      "\u201cTheir right wing clipped our nose and the cockpit. We have damage to our windscreen and ... some of our screens in here,\u201d a pilot said, according to the air traffic control audio.",
      "Images of the damage showed the broken wing on one plane while the other plane's cockpit window was shattered and its nose was deeply gouged in several places.",
      "The plane that had landed \u201cstopped, jerked, and jumped to the right,\u201d passenger William Lusk told ABC. \u201dEveryone went dead silent. And as everyone went dead silent, the pilot calmly came on and said, \u2018Hey, we've been in a crash, everyone remain calm.'\"",
      "Close calls like this could add to worries about aviation safety in the wake of recent crashes and near misses including the deadliest plane crash in the United States in decades, when an Army helicopter collided with an airliner preparing to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.",
      "Former NTSB and FAA crash investigator Jeff Guzzetti said that the ground controller lines up planes on taxiways and directs them where to go, but the pilots are expected to avoid other planes as they move at slow speeds while controllers focus on keeping the runways clear.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to have situational awareness about where your wings are poking out at and what they could hit as you\u2019re taxiing,\u201d said Guzzetti, who is now an aviation safety consultant. \u201cThey (controllers) expect the flight crews to see each other since they\u2019re taxiing at a slow speed. And the controller's main function is to make sure the runway is clear for takeoff and landings.\u201d",
      "Because this happened at night and planes typically turn off their nose lights while taxiing, it may have been more difficult for the pilots to see exactly where the other plane was, Guzzetti said. A plane's taxi lights are on the wings. The landing lights are used to improve visibility and help make sure other pilots can see the plane, but the FAA encourages pilots to be careful not to blind other pilots because landing lights can also impair night vision.",

      "Employers outside the government actually cut 32,000 more jobs than they added in September, according to the survey by ADP Research, with the Midwest particularly hard hit. The survey also revised down its numbers for employment in August, to a loss of 3,000 jobs from a previously reported gain of 54,000.",
      "Usually, traders on Wall Street wait for a more comprehensive U.S. government jobs report to suss out how the job market is doing. The U.S. government gets its data from a larger sample of employers than the ADP survey.",
      "But the next Labor Department report, scheduled for Friday, is likely to be delayed because of the shutdown of the U.S. government  that began just after midnight.",
      "The hope on Wall Street has been that the job market will continue to slow just enough to convince the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates, but not by so much that it brings a recession.",
      "That\u2019s a delicate balance to achieve, and every economic report from the U.S. government that gets delayed only increases the uncertainty about whether it\u2019s possible. Stocks have already run to records on expectations for coming cuts to rates, so a lack of them could send the market lower.",
      "In other dealings on Thursday, U.S. benchmark crude oil shed 11 cents to $61.67 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, edged down 11 cents to $65.24 per barrel.",
      "The U.S. dollar fell to 146.69 Japanese yen from 147.08 yen. The euro rose to $1.1761 from $1.1731.",
      "The price of gold seesawed between gains and losses after surging to fresh highs. As of Thursday, it was up $3.20 at $3,900.70 per ounce. The precious metal, often used as a safe haven for investments in times of uncertainty, has been steadily climbing for months, gaining more than 37% in the past year.",

      "HONOLULU -- Lawyers for a Hawaii real estate investor and broker who sued Shohei Ohtani and his agent denied any improper use of the star's likeness for a development project and alleged the agent was trying to deflect blame for cost overruns at the player's home.",
      "Ohtani and Nez Balelo of CAA Baseball were sued Aug. 8 in Hawaii Circuit Court for the First Circuit by developer Kevin J. Hayes Sr., real estate broker Tomoko Matsumoto, West Point Investment Corp. and Hapuna Estates Property Owners. They accused Ohtani and Balelo of \u201cabuse of power\u201d that allegedly resulted in tortious interference and unjust enrichment impacting a $240 million luxury housing development on the Big Island\u2019s coveted Hapuna Coast.",
      "Hayes and Matsumoto had been dropped from the development deal by Kingsbarn Realty Capital, the joint venture\u2019s majority owner.",

      "\u201cThe allegations as we clarified them make very clear that there was never a breach of the endorsement agreement, the video that was posted on the website promoting specifically this project was sent to Balelo and CAA and another adviser to Ohtani, Mark Daulton, and they were aware of it and never objected to it,\u201d said Josh Schiller, a lawyer for Hayes and the suing entities.",
      "In a motion to dismiss filed Sept. 14, attorneys for Ohtani and Balelo said \u201cplaintiffs exploited Ohtani\u2019s name and photograph to drum up traffic to a website that marketed plaintiffs\u2019 own side project development.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for Hayes and the plaintiffs claimed they kept Balelo and CAA informed.",

      "\u201cThe sudden demand that Kingsbarn terminate plaintiffs was instead a retaliatory measure against Hayes for resisting the constant and improper demands of Balelo and (Ohtani),\u201d the complaint added. \u201cDefendants further calculated that, with plaintiffs removed, they could more easily extract financial concessions from the project and enrich themselves at plaintiffs\u2019 expense.\"",

      "The Democratic member of the U.S. Surface Transportation Board that President Donald Trump fired ahead of the group considering the largest rail merger ever filed a lawsuit challenging his dismissal as illegal.",
      "Robert Primus, who had served on the board since 2001, said the White House never even gave him a reason for his Aug. 27 firing that threatens the independence of the five-member STB. His termination happened before the board got a chance to start reviewing Union Pacific's proposed $85 billion acquisition of Norfolk Southern to create the first true transcontinental railroad.",
      "\u201cOur country\u2019s supply chain demands that the board be independent and transparent. Congress mandated it 138 years ago,\" Primus said. \"Failure to do so will negatively affect the network: railroads, shippers, and rail labor alike, disrupting the supply chain and ultimately injecting instability into our nation\u2019s economy. This is dangerous, and wrong, and cannot not be allowed to happen.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to the lawsuit filed Tuesday, but the press office is running with a reduced staff in the midst of the ongoing government shutdown. At the time of the firing, the only reason offered publicly was as statement saying \u201cRobert Primus did not align with the President's America First agenda.\u201d",
      "But Primus' defenders led by Skye Perryman, who is the President and CEO of Democracy Forward, said this action ignores the way the STB was set up. Congress established that the only reasons someone should be fired from the STB was in cases of inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump continues to target members of independent boards, without cause, in violation of the law. Congress made clear when creating the Surface Transportation Board that the agency should be independent and above politics,\" Perryman said.",

      "Every rail worker union, the nonprofit Rail Passengers Association and Democratic members of Congress quickly condemned the firing when it happened. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin said at the time Primus was fired that it looked like Trump was trying to stack the board so it will rubber-stamp the Union Pacific merger.",
      "Since then, Trump has said the merger sounds good to him after he met with Union Pacific's CEO in the Oval Office last month.",
      "Primus was the only board member to oppose Canadian Pacific\u2019s acquisition of Kansas City Southern railroad when it was approved two years ago because he was concerned it would hurt competition, which remains a concern for him though he hasn't taken a position on the UP-NS deal. He was named board chairman last year by former President Joe Biden and led the board until Trump, after his election, elevated Republican Board member Patrick Fuchs to chairman.",

      "A U.S. government shutdown has begun, and it could impact travel plans, with potential airport delays and cancellations",
      "If a U.S. government shutdown goes on long enough, it could throw a wrench in travel plans, potentially leading to longer airport wait times, flight delays and even cancellations.",
      "The shutdown began Wednesday after President Donald Trump and Congress failed to reach a deal to continue funding government services and operations. That means a vast majority of employees who keep U.S. airports and air travel running are working without pay until the government reopens.",
      "\u201cThe longer a shutdown drags on, the more likely we are to see longer TSA lines, flight delays and cancellations, national parks in disrepair and unnecessary delays in modernizing travel infrastructure,\" Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association, warned in a statement.",

      "That's what happened in 2018 and 2019, when Trump led the country into its longest shutdown ever for 35 days during his first term.",
      "About three weeks into that shutdown, some unpaid security screeners started calling in sick, and air traffic controllers sued the government in a bid to get their paychecks. Miami International Airport had to temporarily close one of its terminals because TSA officers were calling in sick at twice the airport\u2019s usual rate.",
      "The latest shutdown is unfolding at a time when both the TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration are already facing staffing shortages, including a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",
      "If the system can\u2019t handle the number of flights that are scheduled, the FAA will slow down landings and take offs and passengers will see more delays and cancellations.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the union that represents air traffic controllers, said a shutdown weakens the aviation safety system by adding stress on controllers and taking away many of the workers who support them and maintain the outdated system they rely on.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re out there working right now with critical staffing \u2014 the lowest staffing we\u2019ve had in decades of only 10,800, where there should be 14,633. And on top of that, they\u2019re working with unreliable equipment,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "During the 35-day shutdown during Trump's first term, controllers in the busiest U.S. air traffic facilities reported working as much as 60 hours per week, and an increasing number of TSA agents also quit their jobs.",
      "\u201cThis is more than just an inconvenience to the traveler,\u201d Price said of the shutdown. \u201cThis is definitely going to bring up safety and security issues, if it really starts to go into the long term.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball\u2019s playoffs now move into the Division Series, which will include Shohei Ohtani's postseason pitching debut, an unwelcome reunion in Milwaukee, a matchup of teams that tied for the most wins in the American League, and a switch-hitting catcher who finished the season with 60 home runs.",
      "All four series begin Saturday, when two-way star Ohtani \u2014 already with two home runs this postseason after hitting a career-high 55 in the regular season \u2014 starts on the mound for the reigning World Series champion Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 at Philadelphia. He was recovering from elbow surgery while appearing only as a designated hitter last season, but has a 2.87 ERA in 14 starts since returning to pitching in mid-June.",
      "In the other National League series, the 97-win Brewers open at home against former manager Craig Counsell and the Chicago Cubs. Counsell has been booed lustily in Milwaukee ever since he left two years ago for the NL Central rival Cubs.",
      "AL East rivals Toronto and the New York Yankees both won 94 regular-season games. Star slugger Cal Raleigh and Seattle take on Detroit in the other American League series.",
      "The Dodgers were the only team to sweep its best-of-three Wild Card Series, winning at home against Cincinnati. The rest were decided Thursday, the first time MLB had three postseason elimination games on the same day: the Cubs beat San Diego; Detroit knocked out Cleveland; and the Yankees eliminated Boston.",
      "1. The Blue Jays and Yankees finished tied atop their division, but Toronto got the AL's top seed and a first-round bye because of its 8-5 edge in the season series. New York had to play a Wild Card Series against another division foe but beat Boston to advance. Toronto could still be without shortstop Bo Bichette, out since spraining his left knee Sept. 6, but Vladimir Guerrero Jr., George Springer and All-Star catcher Alejandro Kirk boost a solid lineup. Aaron Judge, who went 4 for 11 with one RBI against Boston, had a major league-leading .331 batting average with 53 homers and 114 RBIs in the regular season.2. Ohtani\u2019s 55 homers were second in the NL and one behind Kyle Schwarber, the Phillies DH he will face in the first inning after NL batting champion Trea Turner leads off for them. Ohtani pitched only 47 innings while building up his arm, but threw five no-hit innings against Philadelphia on Sept. 16. The Dodgers, who went 2-4 against Philadelphia this year, are in the NLDS for the 13th season in a row. During the 96-win Phillies\u2019 five-day layoff between games, more than 30,000 fans paid $10 to attend an intrasquad scrimmage at Citizens Bank Park. Philadelphia last won the World Series in 2008, after beating the Dodgers in a five-game National League Championship Series \u2014 just like the following year in their last postseason meeting.3. The Cubs advanced with their first postseason series victory since 2017, the year after winning the World Series. Milwaukee led the majors with 97 wins and won its second NL Central title in a row since Pat Murphy, who was on Counsell\u2019s staff, succeeded him as manager. The Brewers won the division by five games over Chicago, but the Cubs took the season series 7-6. Counsell is Milwaukee\u2019s winningest manager with 707 wins and three division titles from 2015-23. The Brewers had an NL-best 3.58 ERA with a staff led by All-Star pitchers Freddy Peralta, the NL leader with 17 wins, and closer Trevor Megill (6-3, 30 saves). The lineup with 2018 NL MVP Christian Yelich scored 806 runs, their most since 1999.4. Detroit blew a 15 1/2-game lead and lost the AL Central title to Cleveland last weekend, but the Tigers are still playing after beating the Guardians in the Wild Card Series. Tigers ace lefty Tarik Skubal, the reigning AL Cy Young Award winner who could win that prize again, was picked by Detroit in the ninth round of the 2018 amateur draft out of Seattle University, which is only a couple of miles from the Mariners' ballpark. AL West champion Seattle had some extra time off, but the status of All-Star right-hander Bryan Woo (15-7, 2.94 ERA) was still uncertain since he exited his last start Sept. 19 because of pectoral tightness.",

      "\u201cWe play great defense, but Dansby Swanson absolutely beat us with his glove this series,\u201d Shildt said.",
      "With Swanson leading the way, Chicago turned in another sharp defensive performance while eliminating San Diego with a clinching 3-1 victory on Thursday. In a three-game series that had only 11 runs, the Cubs won with their gloves more than their bats.",
      "\u201cWhen you can limit their chances because you catch the ball, it makes a difference,\u201d Swanson said, \u201cand I think that that was on display the last three days.\u201d",
      "Defense was part of Chicago's identity all season long, helping the Cubs to a 92-70 record and the top NL wild card.",

      "\u201cUltimately, it was very special. Kind of closing the door, winning this series.\u201d",
      "Dingler had 16 family members and friends at a Tigers-Guardians game earlier this season. On Thursday, it was only his parents and wife.",
      "Dingler went 8 for 22 in his last six regular-season games, but he was hitless in nine at-bats in the playoff series before coming to the plate with the score tied 1-all and two outs in the sixth.",
      "He got an elevated changeup on a 1-1 count from left-hander Joey Cantillo and launched it 401 feet into the bleachers in left-center to give the Tigers the lead.",
      "Dingler became the first Detroit batter to homer for his first postseason hit since Nick Castellanos in a 2014 Division Series against Baltimore.",
      "Dingler also joined Parker Meadows (2024 Wild Card Series) and Marty Castillo (1984 World Series) as the only rookies in franchise history to hit go-ahead home runs in the postseason.",
      "\u201cI was scratching and crawling a little bit. I was able to get a pitch to hit and do a little damage,\u201d Dingler said. \u201cThe team with the biggest momentum or the most momentum was the one that was going to carry on.\u201d",
      "Dingler went to Ohio State and was a second-round pick in the 2020 amateur draft. He made his major league debut last July and his first opening-day roster this season. He then became Detroit's everyday catcher when Jake Rogers got hurt early in the year and took advantage of the opportunity.",
      "Dingler, who turned 27 on Sept. 17, had a .278 batting average in 126 games along with 13 home runs and 57 RBIs. He also had nine three-hit games this season, tied for second-most among catchers in the majors.",

      "But some way, somehow, both teams made it to the best-of-seven championship series, which opens Friday, and those postseason escapes leave two opponents that aren't likely to back down regardless of the situation. The Aces are -125 series favorites, according to BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "Las Vegas' path to the finals has been anything but smooth. The Aces needed Young's rebound shot to beat the Storm in the deciding Game 3 first round. Then they were taken the distance by a Fever team that went into the playoffs without players such as Caitlin Clark and Sophie Cunningham, lost Kelsey Mitchell to injury in Game 5 and played OT without Aliyah Boston after she fouled out.",

They rallied to force overtime and win 89-83 and stun the Lynx to make the series 1-1.

      "The PGA of America president has finally apologized for the unruly crowd behavior at Bethpage Black during the Ryder Cup",
      "PGA of America president Don Rea Jr., who initially compared vitriolic comments at the Ryder Cup with what could be heard at a youth soccer game, finally apologized Thursday in an email to the 30,000-plus golf professionals he was elected to serve.",
      "Europe built a record lead after two days and held on for a 15-13 victory \u2014 its six in the last eight Ryder Cups \u2014 but the event was marred by a gallery that made it personal and profane.",
      "The PGA of America has been reeling from its lack of response to behavior at Bethpage Black, which began as early as Friday morning when a small section of fans chanted, \u201c(Expletive) you, Rory,\u201d upon seeing Rory McIlroy's image on a video screen from the practice range.",
      "It only got worse, with vulgar language directed at European players, video of a beer being slapped out of someone's hand toward McIlroy's wife, and a comedian hired to lead cheers on the first tee getting involved in the expletive-laden chant toward McIlroy.",
      "Rea said in a BBC interview Sunday morning, \u201cYou've got 50,000 people here that are really excited, and heck, you could go to a youth soccer game and get some people who say the wrong things.\u201d",
      "He went on to say the behavior was distracting American players because they had to spend energy helping to control the crowd.",
      "The Associated Press obtained his letter sent to PGA of America members that began, \u201cLet me begin with what we must own. While the competition was spirited \u2014 especially with the U.S. team\u2019s rally on Sunday afternoon \u2014 some fan behavior clearly crossed the line.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was disrespectful, inappropriate, and not representative of who we are as the PGA of America or as PGA of America golf professionals,\u201d Rea wrote. \u201cWe condemn that behavior unequivocally.\u201d",
      "The abuse was such that McIlroy began pushing back, telling one spectator to \u201cshut the (expletive) up\u201d during a foursomes match Saturday morning. McIlroy and Shane Lowry each gave it back to the gallery during their fourballs victory that afternoon.",
      "Rea also said during his BBC interview when asked directly about the abuse hurled toward McIlroy, \u201cI haven't heard some of that. I'm sure it happened. It happens when we're over in Rome on the other side, and Rory understands. Things like that are going to happen.\"",
      "Matt Fitzpatrick said about the Rome reference, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty offensive to European fans the fact that he said that, really.\u201d",
      "Lowry said the level of abuse directed at McIlroy's wife was \u201castonishing.\u201d",

      "Two-time Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya is ending her seven-year legal challenge against sex eligibility rules in track and field",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya is ending a seven-year legal challenge against sex eligibility rules in track and field, her lawyers said Thursday, despite winning a ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in July that appeared to have reignited one of sports' most contentious cases.",
      "Patrick Bracher, a lawyer for Semenya, said in an email to The Associated Press that they wouldn't take her appeal back to the Swiss supreme court, which was an option and what many presumed to be Semenya's next step after the European rights court ruling.",
      "\u201cCaster\u2019s legal challenge reached the highest possible court with a highly successful outcome and will not be taken further in the circumstances,\u201d Bracher wrote.",
      "Semenya is a two-time Olympic gold medallist in the 800 meters from South Africa who has been banned from running in her favorite race at major international meets like the Olympics and world championships since 2019 because she refused to follow the rules and take medication to artificially reduce her hormone levels.",
      "Since 2018, she has taken her legal battle against the rules enforced by track governing body World Athletics to three courts; the Switzerland-based highest court for sports, the Swiss Federal Tribunal and the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "She has argued that the rules infringed her rights. She lost her appeals at the Court of Arbitration for Sport and at the Swiss Federal Tribunal.",
      "However, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in July that she hadn't had a fair hearing at the Swiss tribunal and it hadn't properly considered some of the complex arguments. That opened an avenue for her to continue her challenge.",
      "Semenya was the world's dominant middle-distance runner and was unbeaten in more than 30 races when she was barred. Now 34, she has moved into coaching, with the regulations effectively ending her career.",
      "She has been the face of fiercely contentious sex eligibility rules in sports since she won the world championships as a teenager in 2009 and was forced to undergo sex verification tests. Semenya has one of a number of conditions known as differences in sex development, or DSD. She has the typical male XY chromosome pattern but also female physical traits and high levels of naturally occurring testosterone. DSD conditions are sometimes called intersex conditions.",
      "Semenya is not transgender despite her case often being conflated with the divisive debate over the participation of transgender athletes in female competitions. She was identified as female at birth, raised as a girl, and has always identified as female.",
      "World Athletics says Semenya and a small number of other DSD athletes in international track have testosterone levels in the male range, giving them an unfair advantage over other women because of the hormone's connection to muscle mass and cardio-vascular performance.",

      "How much advantage DSD athletes gain from testosterone has been disputed in one of the many complex details of Semenya's landmark case.",
      "Track and field introduced new rules governing women with high natural testosterone in 2011 in a move seen as a direct response to the arrival of Semenya. The regulations have been made stricter over the years and the latest rule change introduced earlier this year moves away from monitoring testosterone and requires women competing in international track to undergo a genetic test to check for the presence of a Y chromosome.",
      "If they fail the one-off genetic sex eligibility test, they are banned from female competitions. The new rules came into effect Sept. 1 ahead of last month's world championships.",
      "Bracher noted in his email to the AP that the current regulations are very different to those Semenya challenged in court when her case started seven years ago. But Semenya's recent victory at the European rights court might provide a basis for a new challenge by another athlete against the current regulations, he said.",
      "While Semenya's case made track and field the main battleground over sex eligibility for nearly two decades, other high-profile sports like swimming have moved to block women with DSD conditions from competing. Semenya's case was often seen as a precedent for other sports to introduce their own restrictions.",
      "Boxing was mired in a sex eligibility scandal at the Paris Olympics last year over the participation of Imane Khelif of Algeria and Lin Yu-ting of Taiwan after officials claimed they had previously failed unspecified sex verification tests.",
      "Boxing has now also introduced genetic sex tests and Khelif, who won a gold medal in Paris, has followed Semenya and appealed against them at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.",

      "With Brian Snitker stepping down in Atlanta, there are now eight major league teams with a managerial opening",
      "With Brian Snitker stepping down in Atlanta, there are now eight major league teams with a managerial opening. Five of those spots became vacant since the end of the season, and three teams have had interim managers in place for a while.",
      "With the dust settling, it's time to take a look at which of these jobs are the most attractive.",
      "It's a subjective exercise of course, and it depends on what a prospective manager values. Some teams can offer a talented current roster, while others might have a better long-term outlook. And of course, the quality of the front office and ownership plays a big role.",
      "The good: Atlanta has a lot more talent than your usual 76-win team, and that puts the Braves atop the list. There's good reason to believe they are poised for a rebound after Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. and Austin Riley each missed at least 60 games this year. Few teams can match Atlanta's reputation for consistent success over the past three-plus decades, and even since Bobby Cox departed in 2010, the Braves have needed only two managers \u2014 Snitker and Fredi Gonzalez.",
      "The bad: It's a tough division, and after winning 104 games in 2023, Atlanta declined to 89 before falling even further this year. So the Braves' of wealth of talent under team control may have already peaked.",
      "The good: There's still a chance for short-term success here after Texas led the major leagues in ERA for the first time in franchise history. The Rangers have veteran starters Jacob deGrom and Nathan Eovaldi signed beyond next season, along with former No. 2 overall pick Jack Leiter coming off a solid rookie season. Their retractable-roof home stadium, which stays mostly closed, has become more of a pitcher\u2019s ballpark.",
      "The bad: The front office has already indicated that the $241 million payroll is going down after the Rangers missed the playoffs without a winning record in both seasons since their only World Series championship in 2023. There is at least some uncertainly on how to proceed after four seasons with the half-billion dollar middle infield of shortstop Corey Seager and second baseman Marcus Semien. And outgoing manager Bruce Bochy is a tough act to follow.",
      "The good: A couple years ago, the Baltimore job would have ranked even higher after the Orioles won 101 games behind a young, cost-controlled core that could make any franchise envious. Now Baltimore has to rebound from a sub-.500 season, but there's still a lot of potential here with Gunnar Henderson in the middle of the infield and Kyle Bradish looking good down the stretch on the mound. The parade of prospects continued this year, with catcher Samuel Basallo arriving in August.",
      "The bad: Basallo is the only one of those young standouts to sign an extension so far, so it's possible the Orioles could lose Henderson and some others before too long. Also, several of Baltimore's young hitters regressed this year, meaning the future isn't as certain as it once seemed. After a successful rebuild, there are still questions about the franchise's ability to attract established stars, and the AL East can be brutal.",
      "The good: It's an organization with plenty of history, and the front office showed it was willing to go big when it traded for Rafael Devers. Throw in a beautiful ballpark and a market they now have all to themselves, and it feels like the Giants should never be all that far from contention.",
      "The bad: This job comes with a fair amount of pressure \u2014 witness Bob Melvin getting fired after just two seasons \u2014 and the Giants have to compete with the Dodgers in the NL West. Although Devers is a decent hitter to build around, the overall roster is decidedly average.",
      "The good: This ranking assumes some real potential in Washington's young players. As badly as this season went, James Wood, C.J. Abrams, Dylan Crews, Robert Hassell III and MacKenzie Gore \u2014 with Eli Willits on the way \u2014 is a group that could eventually win a lot of games. And there's plenty of room for the payroll to grow.",

      "The bad: Will the payroll grow? After a couple years attempting to sell the team, Mark Lerner and his family decided not to, and the Nationals have been reticent in their spending of late.",
      "The good: The AL Central is a forgiving spot: Nobody in the division has won more than 93 games since the Twins themselves won 101 in 2019. A market like Minnesota can compete with Detroit, Kansas City and Cleveland, and with the Twins coming off a deadline sell-off, this should be a relatively low-pressure situation initially.",
      "The bad: Like the Nationals, Twins ownership flirted with a sale before deciding against it. The team cut payroll after winning the division in 2023, with their regional television revenue taking a hit after the Diamond Sports Group bankruptcy.",
      "The good: It's a team that has been willing to spend in the past. That hasn't necessarily worked out \u2014 witness the Anthony Rendon contract \u2014 but it suggests under the right circumstances, money won't be an obstacle. And as bad as things have been recently, they did improve by nine games this year.",

This franchise has been a revolving door of managers since Mike Scioscia's departure.",
      "The good: Expectations should be low, and Denver can be lovely in the summer.",
      "The bad: The Rockies didn't set the record for losses this year, but make no mistake: They were one of the worst teams ever, posting a run differential that was the worst in modern history. They have only two top-100 prospects according to MLB Pipeline, and neither has reached Triple-A yet. Despite plenty of fan support and no competing big league teams nearby, the Rockies have never really built a sustained winner.",

      "ST. ANDREWS, Scotland -- Ryan Brehm made his Dunhill Links Championship debut with a 63 on the only course he didn't play in practice to share the lead. Tyrrell Hatton, Tommy Fleetwood and a Ryder Cup quartet of stars played on fumes and held up quite nicely Thursday.",

      "Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology\u2019s volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet\u2019s early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Former Cisco Systems CEO John Chambers learned all about technology's volatile highs and lows as a veteran of the internet's early boom days during the late 1990s and the ensuing meltdown that followed the mania.",
      "And now he is seeing potential signs of the cycle repeating with another transformative technology as a whirlwind of investments and excitement about artificial intelligence has propelled the stock market to new highs.",
      "Chambers took a similarly meteoric ride in his early days running Cisco, which had a market value of about $15 billion in 1995, when networking equipment suddenly became must-have components for the buildup of the internet. The feverish demand briefly turned the firm into the world's most valuable company \u2014 worth $550 billion in March 2000 \u2014 before the investment bubble burst. The crash caused Cisco's stock price to plunge more than 80% during a period that Chambers still recalls as the worst of his career.",
      "Cisco bounced back to deliver consistent financial growth to help establish Chambers as one of Silicon Valley's most respected leaders before he stepped down as CEO in 2015, but company's stock price has never approached the peak it reached a quarter century ago.",
      "While remaining Cisco's chairman emeritus, Chambers is now as fascinated by the AI's transformative powers as he once was by the internet revolution. Only this time he is advising CEOs as a venture capitalist investing in AI startups rather than running a company himself. Chambers, 76, recently discussed the promise and perils of the AI boom with The Associated Press. The interview has been edited for clarity.",
      "Q: Does the current AI mania remind you of the internet boom of the 1990s?",
      "A: Absolutely. There are a lot of parallels but there are also some spectacular differences. AI is moving at five times the speed and will produce three times the outcomes of the internet age. In the internet age, a startup would develop products for two years and then in year three, they would take that out into the market. Today, AI startups develop the product in a month and sometimes in a week, and then they bring it to market in one or two quarters.",
      "In the internet age, there was an irrational exuberance on a really large scale. In this AI one, there is a lot of tremendous optimism that does indicate a future bubble for certain companies. Is there going to be train wreck? Yes, for those that aren\u2019t able to translate the technology into a sustainable competitive advantage, how are you going to generate revenue after all the money you poured into it?",
      "Q: Do you think AI is going to eliminate a lot of jobs?",
      "A: It happened with the internet. The problem this time is that if I am right about AI moving at five times the speed of the internet, we are going to destroy jobs faster than we can replace them. Will we be able to replace them over time? Yes, but there is going to be a drought while we have to re-educate lots of people.",

      "A: It\u2019s the most uncertain time on a global basis, ever. I would argue that this is the new normal. With the speed the market is moving at now, you have to be able to reinvent yourself, which most CEOs and business leaders don\u2019t know how to do, especially with AI.",
      "Q: What\u2019s your view of how Big Tech has been working with President Donald Trump during his second term in office?",
      "A: Let\u2019s be realistic. Silicon Valley moved right, there shouldn\u2019t be any doubt. They did it for economic reasons. And practicality, they did it for their shareholders but also regulation was getting out of control. They weren\u2019t able to grow and China was plainly beating us.",
      "Q: How worried are you about China?",
      "A: I think China has full intention to win at the U.S.\u2019s expense. In China, there are no rules, there is no intellectual property, there are no issues about misusing the power. They intend to blow past militarily, economically, and in every other way. I do not view them as a partner, I view them as a serious competitor on all fronts and someone I don\u2019t trust. I think over time people are going to recognize it\u2019s in the U.S.\u2019s best interest and it\u2019s in China\u2019s best interest for us to get along. So go out 10 years, and that\u2019s the most likely outcome. But I think the next five years are going to be really bumpy and dangerous. We should have no illusions that they intend to crush us.",

      "In the wake of Jane Goodall's death, the many scientists and others influenced by her are promising to do their best to carry on her legacy",
      "In her 91 years, Jane Goodall transformed science and humanity's understanding of our closest living relatives on the planet \u2014 chimpanzees and other great apes. Her patient fieldwork and tireless advocacy for conservation inspired generations of future researchers and activists, especially women and young people, around the world.",
      "Her death on Wednesday set off a torrent of tributes for the famed primate researcher, with many people sharing stories of how Goodall and her work inspired their own careers. The tributes also included pledges to honor Goodall\u2019s memory by redoubling efforts to safeguard a planet that sorely needs it.",
      "\u201cJane Goodall is an icon \u2013 because she was the start of so much,\u201d said Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France.",
      "She recalled how many years ago Goodall answered a letter from a young aspiring researcher. \u201cI wrote her a letter asking how to become a primatologist. She sent back a handwritten letter and told me it will be hard, but I should try,\u201d Crockford said. \u201cFor me, she gave me my career.\u201d",
      "Goodall was one of three pioneering young women studying great apes in the 1960s and 1970s who began to revolutionize the way people understood just what was -- and wasn\u2019t -- unique about our own species. Sometimes called the \u201cTri-mates,\u201d Goodall, Dian Fossey and Birut\u00e9 Galdikas spent years documenting the intimate lives of chimpanzees in Tanzania, mountain gorillas in Rwanda, and orangutans in Indonesia, respectively.",
      "The projects they began have produced some of the longest-running studies about animal behavior in the world that are crucial to understanding such long-lived species. \u201cThese animals are like us, slow to mature and reproduce, and living for decades. We are still learning new things about them,\u201d said Tara Stoinski, a primatologist and president of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund. \u201cJane and Dian knew each other and learned from each other, and the scientists who continued their work continue to collaborate today.\u201d",
      "Goodall studied chimpanzees \u2014 as a species and as individuals. And she named them: David Greybeard, Flo, Fifi, Goliath. That was highly unconventional at the time, but Goodall\u2019s attention to individuals created space for scientists to observe and record differences in individual behaviors, preferences and even emotions.",
      "Catherine Hobaiter, a primatologist at St. Andrews University who was inspired by Goodall, recalled how Goodall carefully combined empathy and objectivity. Goodall liked to use a particular phrase, \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as happy,\u201d or \u201cIf they were human, we would describe them as friends \u2013- these two individuals together,\u201d Hobaiter said. Goodall didn\u2019t project precise feelings onto the chimpanzees, but nor did she deny the capacity of animals besides humans to have emotional lives.",
      "Goodall and her frequent collaborator, evolutionary biologist Marc Bekoff, had just finished the text of a forthcoming children's book, called \u201cEvery Elephant Has a Name,\u201d which will be published around early 2027.",
      "From the late 1980s until her death, Goodall spent less time in the field and more time on the road talking to students, teachers, diplomats, park rangers, presidents and many others around the world. She inspired countless others through her books. Her mission was to inspire action to protect the natural world.",
      "In 1991, she founded an organization called Roots & Shoots that grew to include chapters of young people in dozens of countries.",
      "Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist and founder of the nonprofit Saving Nature, recalled when he and Goodall were invited to speak to a congressional hearing about deforestation and extinction. Down the marble halls of the government building, \u201cthere was a huge line of teenage girls and their mothers just waiting to get inside the room to hear Jane speak,\u201d Pimm said Thursday. \u201cShe was mobbed everywhere she went -- she was just this incredible inspiration to people in general, particularly to young women.\u201d",
      "Goodall wanted everyone to find their voice, no matter their age or station, said Zanagee Artis, co-founder of the youth climate movement Zero Hour. \u201cI really appreciated how much Jane valued young people being in the room -- she really fostered intergenerational movement building,\u201d said Artis, who now works for the Natural Resources Defense Council.",

      "That includes Goodall\u2019s son and three grandchildren, who are an important part of the work of the Jane Goodall Institute and in their own endeavors, said Mary Lewis, a vice president at the institute who began working with the famed primatologist in 1990.",
      "Goodall\u2019s son, Hugo van Lawick, works on sustainable housing. He is currently in Rwanda. Grandson Merlin and granddaughter Angelo work with the institute, while grandson Nick is a photographer and filmmaker, Lewis said. \u201cShe has her own family legacy as well as the legacy through her institutes around the world,\u201d said Lewis.",
      "In addition to her famed research center in Tanzania and chimpanzee sanctuaries in other countries, including the Republic of Congo and South Africa, a new cultural center is expected to open in Tanzania late next year. There also are Jane Goodall Institutes in 26 countries, and communities are leading conservation projects in several countries, including an effort in Senegal to save critically endangered Western chimpanzees.",
      "But it is the institute\u2019s youth-led education program called Roots & Shoots that Goodall regarded as her enduring legacy because it is \u201cempowering new generations,\u201d Lewis said.",

      "They harvest in the Alentejo region, sometimes called the \u201cTuscany of Portugal\u201d for its rolling vineyards, olive groves and forests that supply cork for the wines. In this vineyard about a 90-minute drive east of Lisbon, the cool autumn night carries the smell of ripe fruit. The workers' laughter blends with the sound of rustling leaves.",
      "The night harvest is a time-honored practice in viticulture, meant to preserve the freshness of grapes and shield them from the adverse effects of daytime heat, sunlight and oxidation. As summers in Portugal grow longer, hotter and more unpredictable \u2014 in part due to climate change \u2014 the practice has become more common here.",
      "B\u00e1rbara Monteiro, co-owner and manager of the Herdade Da Fonte Santa vineyard said she struggled at first to convince her harvesters to work at night \u2014 midnight to 8 a.m. They began doing so in 2019.",
      "\u201cToday, we can say they actually prefer this schedule, as they can often work almost another day, enjoy the day, and avoid the extreme heat we often experience here,\u201d she said.",
      "The wine harvest in Spain, Italy and Portugal generally takes place between late August and October, with variations based on the region, type of grapes and weather conditions.",
      "Some vineyards have been harvesting at night for years. In parts of Italy, others have for more than a decade. The El Coto de Rioja vineyard in Spain\u2019s famed La Rioja region opts for early morning harvests, beginning at 5 or 6 a.m., according to C\u00e9sar Fern\u00e1ndez, the vineyard's technical director and winemaker.",

      "Grapes are naturally sensitive to temperature shifts. Warmer weather can make them reach sugar maturity before developing a full flavor and ripeness, leading to higher alcohol levels but less complex wines. Intense heat also speeds up acid loss and can trigger early fermentation as wild yeasts and bacteria become more active.",
      "By harvesting at night, vintners can lock in more vibrant flavors that improve the quality of the wine produced.",

      "NEW YORK -- It's official: AOL's dial-up internet has taken its last bow.",
      "AOL previously confirmed it would be pulling the plug on Tuesday (Sept. 30) \u2014 writing in a brief update on its support site last month that it \u201croutinely evaluates\" its offerings and had decided to discontinue dial-up, as well as associated software \u201coptimized for older operating systems,\u201d from its plans.",

      "AOL, formerly America Online, introduced many households to the World Wide Web for the first time when its dial-up service launched decades ago, rising to prominence particularly in the 90s and early 2000s.",
      "The creaky door to the internet was characterized by a once-ubiquitous series of beeps and buzzes heard over the phone line used to connect your computer online \u2014 along with frustrations of being kicked off the web if anyone else at home needed the landline for another call, and an endless bombardment of CDs mailed out by AOL to advertise free trials.",
      "Eventually, broadband and wireless offerings emerged and rose to dominance, doing away with dial-up's quirks for most people accessing the internet today \u2014 but not everyone.",
      "A handful of consumers have continued to rely on internet services connected over telephone lines. In the U.S., according to Census Bureau data, an estimated 163,401 households were using dial-up alone to get online in 2023, representing just over 0.13% of all homes with internet subscriptions nationwide.",

      "Microsoft retired video calling service Skype just earlier this year \u2014 as well as Internet Explorer back in 2022. And in 2017, AOL discontinued its Instant Messenger \u2014 a chat platform that was once lauded as the biggest trend in online communication since email when it was founded in 1997, but later struggled to ward off rivals.",

      "Before it was America Online, AOL was founded as Quantum Computer Services in 1985. It soon rebranded and hit the public market in 1991. Near the height of the dot-com boom, AOL's market value reached nearly $164 billion in 2000. But tumultuous years followed, and that valuation plummeted as the once-tech pioneer bounced between multiple owners. After a disastrous merger with Time Warner Inc., Verizon acquired AOL \u2014 which later sold AOL, along with Yahoo, to a private equity firm.",

      "\u201cBeing habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" said the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study.",
      "An international team decided to launch a fresh analysis of tiny grains of ice encountered as Cassini flew through the moon's geysers. The grains were young compared with the much older geyser particles that ended up in one of Saturn\u2019s outermost rings.",
      "These new grains collided with Cassini\u2019s cosmic dust analyzer at 40,000 mph (64,800 kph), faster than the old ones. The increased speed provided a clearer view of the chemical compounds present, the scientists noted.",
      "Organic molecules already had been spotted in the old geyser grains, but their age raised questions as to whether they had been altered over the years by space radiation.",
      "Scientists found some of the same molecules in the fresh grains, confirming they came from the moon\u2019s underground sea, as well as new chemical compounds. The findings were published in Nature Astronomy.",
      "An ice-encapsulated water world barely 310 miles (500 kilometers) across with a rocky core, Enceladus is suspected of having hydrothermal vents on its ocean floor, quite possibly like those in the Arctic. The moon's jets of water vapor and frozen particles can stretch thousands of miles (kilometers) into space.",

      "More online platforms are giving secondhand shopping a digital upgrade, rolling out features like livestream shopping and AI-powered search to make thrifting faster and more exciting.",
      "Although choosing secondhand over new is often the more sustainable option, experts say it\u2019s not a license to overconsume. They warn that resale has its limits, since buying more than you need still fuels waste, and shopping online can add emissions from servers and shipping, thrifted or not.",
      "Here's how industry experts and fashion-forward shoppers shop secondhand sustainably \u2014 and how to find quality pieces that last while looking cool, too.",
      "At eBay\u2019s secondhand runway shows in New York and London, models wore pre-loved designer pieces that guests could shop live. Secondhand items like those make up 40% of the company's sales, said Alexis Hoopes, eBay\u2019s vice president of fashion.",
      "\u201cOne of our big priorities is making secondhand just as good as shopping in the primary market,\" she said.",
      "ThredUp and The RealReal have reported record sales this year, signaling that the online resale market is growing quickly. Live-auction apps like Whatnot are giving shoppers more platforms to bid on used clothing.",
      "Shoppers navigating growing online options with an eye toward sustainability can still end up buying more than they need.",
      "\u201cPeople who buy secondhand clothing were found to buy more clothing than people who don\u2019t,\u201d said Meital Peleg Mizrachi, a postdoctoral fellow at Yale University who researches textile waste. \u201cNot only that, they tend to get rid of those clothes faster than other consumers. So they\u2019re ending up creating more textile waste because they\u2019re buying more and using that clothing for a shorter period of time.\u201d",
      "Less than 20% of clothing donations to charities are resold in their stores, according to the Council for Textile Recycling. The rest is downcycled, exported \u2014 often to countries in the Global South \u2014 or ultimately discarded in landfills.",
      "Online resale also generates emissions from shipping and packaging, and running massive e-commerce platforms consumes energy, all factors that need to be considered, said Alana James, a fashion professor at Northumbria University. But all of that pales in comparison to the environmental impact of producing a new garment, she said.",
      "Experts say truly sustainable fashion requires breaking away from the fast-fashion mindset \u2014 the constant pressure to \u201cbuy now\u201d and the manufactured sense of scarcity that fuels overconsumption.",
      "\u201cHaul\u201d culture \u2014 the social media trend of showing off massive shopping sprees \u2014 shows overconsumption in a new way, said Katrina Caspelich, communications director for Remake, an advocacy group for human rights and climate justice in fashion.",
      "\u201cResponsible secondhand shopping means choosing pieces you\u2019ll truly wear, investing in quality and resisting the pull of endless trend cycles,\" she said.",
      "It can be difficult to determine quality when shopping online, but asking the seller about the garment\u2019s composition can help, said Wisdom Kaye, a menswear content creator.",
      "Natural fabrics are a good place to start, said Caspelich.",
      "\u201cLook for silk, cotton, bamboo \u2014 things that breathe and last \u2014 versus synthetics like polyester or nylon,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Scientists warn that &ldquo;flying rivers&rdquo; &mdash; invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon &mdash; are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
    "story": [
      "Scientists warn that \u201cflying rivers\u201d \u2014 invisible streams of moisture that carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean westward across the Amazon \u2014 are weakening as deforestation and climate change advance",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Droughts have withered crops in Peru, fires have scorched the Amazon and hydroelectric dams in Ecuador have struggled to keep the lights on as rivers dry up. Scientists say the cause may lie high above the rainforest, where invisible \u201cflying rivers\u201d carry rain from the Atlantic Ocean across South America.",
      "New analysis warns that relentless deforestation is disrupting that water flow and suggests that continuing tree loss will worsen droughts in the southwestern Amazon and could eventually trigger those regions to shift from rainforest to drier savanna \u2014 grassland with far fewer trees.",
      "\u201cThese are the forces that actually create and sustain the Amazon rainforest,\u201d said Matt Finer, a senior researcher with Amazon Conservation\u2019s Monitoring of the Andean Amazon Project (MAAP), which tracks deforestation and climate threats across the basin and carried out the analysis.",
      "\u201cIf you break that pump by cutting down too much forest, the rains stop reaching where they need to go.\u201d",
      "Most of the Amazon\u2019s rainfall starts over the Atlantic Ocean. Moist air is pushed inland by steady winds that blow west along the equator, known as the trade winds. The forest then acts like a pump, effectively relaying the water thousands of miles westward as the trees absorb water, then release it back into the air.",
      "Brazilian climate scientist Carlos Nobre was among the early researchers who calculated how much of the water vapor from the Atlantic would move through and eventually out of the Amazon basin. He and colleagues coined the \u201cflying rivers\u201d term at a 2006 scientific meeting, and interest grew as scientists warned that a weakening of the rivers could push the Amazon into a tipping point where rainforest would turn to savanna.",
      "That's important because the Amazon rainforest is a vast storehouse for the carbon dioxide that largely drives the world's warming. Such a shift would devastate wildlife and Indigenous communities and threaten farming, water supplies and weather stability far beyond the region.",
      "The analysis by Finer's group found that southern Peru and northern Bolivia are especially vulnerable. During the dry season, flying rivers sweep across southern Brazil before reaching the Andes \u2014 precisely where deforestation is most intense. The loss of trees means less water vapor is carried westward, raising the risk of drought in iconic protected areas such as Peru\u2019s Manu National Park.",
      "\u201cPeru can do everything right to protect a place like Manu,\u201d Finer said. \u201cBut if deforestation keeps cutting into the pump in Brazil, the rains that sustain it may never arrive.\u201d",
      "Nobre said as much as 50% of rainfall in the western Amazon near the Andes depends on the flying rivers.",
      "Corine Vriesendorp, Amazon Conservation\u2019s director of science based in Cusco, Peru, said the changes are already visible.",
      "\u201cThe last two years have brought the driest conditions the Amazon has ever seen,\u201d Vriesendorp said. \u201cEcological calendars that Indigenous communities use \u2014 when to plant, when to fish, when animals reproduce \u2014 are increasingly out of sync. Having less and more unpredictable rain will have an even bigger impact on their lives than climate change is already having.\u201d",
      "Farmers face failed harvests, Indigenous families struggle with disrupted fishing and hunting seasons and cities that rely on hydroelectric power see outages as the rivers that provide the power dry up.",
      "MAAP researchers found that rainfall patterns depend on when and where the flying rivers cross the basin. In the wet season, their northern route flows mostly over intact forests in Guyana, Suriname and northern Brazil, keeping the system strong.",

      "But in the dry season \u2014 when forests are already stressed by heat \u2014 the aerial rivers cut across southern Brazil, where deforestation fronts spread along highways and farms and there simply are fewer trees to help move the moisture along.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during the dry months, when the forest most needs water, that the flying rivers are most disrupted,\u201d Finer said.",
      "Finer pointed to roads that can accelerate deforestation, noting that the controversial BR-319 highway in Brazil \u2014 a project to pave a road through one of the last intact parts of the southern Amazon \u2014 could create an entirely new deforestation front.",
      "For years, scientists have warned about the Amazon tipping toward savannah. Finer said the new study complicates that picture.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a single, all-at-once collapse,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain areas, like the southwest Amazon, are more vulnerable and will feel the impacts first. And we\u2019re already seeing early signs of rainfall reduction downwind of deforested areas.\u201d",
      "Nobre said the risks are stark. Amazon forests have already lost about 17% of their cover, mostly to cattle and soy. Those ecosystems recycle far less water.",
      "\u201cThe dry season is now five weeks longer than it was 45 years ago, with 20 to 30% less rainfall,\u201d he said. \u201cIf deforestation exceeds 20 to 25% and warming reaches 2 degrees Celsius, there\u2019s no way to prevent the Amazon from reaching the tipping point.\u201d",
      "Protecting intact forests, supporting Indigenous land rights and restoring deforested areas are the clearest paths forward, researchers say.",
      "\u201cTo avoid collapse we need zero deforestation, degradation and fires \u2014 immediately,\u201d Nobre said. \u201cAnd we must begin large-scale forest restoration, not less than half a million square kilometers. If we do that, and keep global warming below 2 degrees, we can still save the Amazon.\u201d",
      "Finer said governments should consider new conservation categories specifically designed to protect flying rivers \u2014 safeguarding not just land but the atmospheric flows that make the rainforest possible.",
      "For Vriesendorp, that means regional cooperation. She praised Peru for creating vast parks and Indigenous reserves in the southeast, including Manu National Park. But, she said, \u201cthis can\u2019t be solved by one country alone. Peru depends on Brazil, and Brazil depends on its neighbors. We need basin-wide solutions.\u201d",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "OpenAI has announced new parental controls for ChatGPT to make it safer for teens",
      "LONDON -- OpenAI said Monday it's adding parental controls to ChatGPT that are designed to provide teen users of the popular platform with a safer and more \u201cage-appropriate\u201d experience.",
      "The company is taking action after AI chatbot safety for young users has hit the headlines. The technology's dangers have been recently highlighted by a number of cases in which teenagers took their lives after interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has even opened an inquiry into several tech companies about the potential harms to children and teenagers who use their AI chatbots as companions.",
      "In a blog post posted Monday, OpenAI outlined the new controls for parents. Here is a breakdown:",
      "The parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.",
      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

      "Parents are getting a control panel where they can adjust a range of settings as well as switch off the restrictions on sensitive content mentioned above.",
      "For example, does your teen stay up way past bedtime to use ChatGPT? Parents can set a quiet time when the chatbot can't be used.",
      "Other settings include turning off the AI's memory so conversations can't be saved and won't be used in future responses; turning off the ability to generate or edit images; turning off voice mode; and opting out of having chats used to train ChatGPT's AI models.",
      "OpenAI is also being more proactive when it comes to letting parents know that their child might be in distress.",
      "It's setting up a new notification system to inform them when something might be \u201cseriously wrong\u201d and a teen user might be thinking about harming themselves.",
      "A small team of specialists will review the situation and, in the rare case that there are \u201csigns of acute distress,\u201d they'll notify parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone \u2014 unless the parent has opted out.",
      "OpenAI said it will protect the teen's privacy by only sharing the information needed for parents or emergency responders to provide help.",
      "\u201cNo system is perfect, and we know we might sometimes raise an alarm when there isn\u2019t real danger, but we think it\u2019s better to act and alert a parent so they can step in than to stay silent,\u201d the company said.",

      "Prosecutors accused Sean Combs of downplaying his alleged violence, despite his lawyers openly conceding during trial that he was violent with two of his exes.",
      "\"He owned that violence only insofar as it benefited him,\" prosecutor Christy Slavik said.",
      "\"The violence in this case was uncontested,\" Slavik said. \"The evidence of what the defendant did was overwhelming.\"",
      "Slavik emphasized what she said was \"life-altering\" violence that Combs\u2019 girlfriends Cassie Ventura and a woman who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane\" testified at trial, as well as Combs\u2019 allegedly abusive behavior towards his employees.",
      "\"He hit her, he kicked her, he threw her into walls, he stomped on her face, he dragged her by the hair,\" Slavik said of Ventura, who she said was \"treated like an animal.\"",
      "\"Once is bad enough,\" she said. \"Dozens and dozens of times is something the public must be defended from.\"",
      "\"This is not a person who has accepted responsibility,\" she said.",
      "Slavik also pushed back against the defense argument that Combs\u2019 relationships with \"Jane\" and Ventura were mutually harmful.",
      "\"The court heard Cassie engaging in a 'freak-off' while he was overdosing on drugs. What is mutual about that?\" Slavik said. \"There is nothing mutual about that.\"",
      "Even if the judge removed the alleged violence, Slavik argued that a significant sentence would still be justified. Prosecutors argued that the most comparable case for Combs\u2019 conduct is a 2023 conviction of a movie producer who ran an international prostitution business. The defendant in that case received a five-year prison sentence.",
      "\"Even prostitution cases that don\u2019t involve violence get significant sentences in this district,\" she said.",
      "Prosecutor urges harsh sentence for Combs, says he did 'horrible things'",
      "A federal prosecutor urged Judge Arun Subramanian to impose a harsh sentence to punish Sean Combs not only for transporting male escorts across state lines for prostitution but also for \u201cstaggering\u201d violence.",
      "\u201cThe defense has tried to turn this into a minor violation in a sex, drugs and rock and roll lifestyle,\u201d the prosecutor, Christy Slavik, said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear: This isn\u2019t just a case about 'freak offs' or hotel nights. It\u2019s not just a case about sex. It\u2019s a case about real victims who suffered real harm at the hands of the defendant.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201cdid horrible things\u201d to Cassie Ventura and to \u201cJane\u201d who were in \u201cabusive\u201d relationships with him.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a case about transportation for prostitution. It\u2019s a case about transportation for prostitution and violence,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Slavik cast doubt on Combs\u2019 sincerity when he wrote to the judge that he accepted \u201cresponsibility and accountability\u201d for his actions, noting a character letter received that said Combs has booked speaking engagements in Miami for next week.",
      "\u201cThat is the opposite of demonstrating respect for the law,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Prosecutors have urged the judge to impose a sentence of 11 years in prison. Judge Subramanian noted sentencing guidelines called for a sentence between 5 and 7 years. The judge retains discretion to vary the sentence up or down.",
      "Judge says Combs is not remorseful for prostitution-related conduct",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian said he does not believe Sean Combs is taking full responsibility for his prostitution-related conduct.",
      "\"Combs has challenged his factual guilt full-throatedly,\" Subramanian said. He said the music mogul has not demonstrated remorse for the crimes for which he was convicted.",
      "Combs was found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution in connection with his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura, and guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution in connection with another ex-girlfriend, who testified under the pseudonym \"Jane.\"",
      "Subramanian also said he will consider some of the conduct for which Combs was acquitted when he imposes his sentence.",
      "Combs was found not guilty of racketeering conspiracy, the most serious charge. He was also found not guilty of both charges of sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion.",
      "\"The court can consider acquitted conduct for any reason other than changing the guidelines range,\" the judge said.",
      "While the acquitted counts cannot be considered to determine Combs\u2019 possible sentencing range, Subramanian said the testimony and evidence related to those counts are relevant context to demonstrate the force Combs used to carry out the prostitution-related crimes.",
      "\"There is no doubt that this evidence counts as coercion,\" he added. \"There were threats of bodily harm in this case.\"",
      "Subramanian also said that he plans to consider as victims in this case the seven escorts who Combs said he paid for entertainment. The judge said Combs was clearly the organizer of \u201cfreak-offs\u201d and hotel nights and paid for the escorts, and should be responsible for the conduct.",
      "\"The definition of victim is expansive,\" he said.",
      "Earlier in the hearing, prosecutors sought to push back on defense lawyers\u2019 attempt to have multiple people testify about Combs\u2019 character during the sentencing, arguing it distracts from the victims in the case.",
      "\"The defense is trying to drown out the voice of victims in favor of character witnesses,\" a prosecutor argued.",
      "Subramanian will allow Combs\u2019 children and pastor to speak.",
      "Combs sentencing hearing begins, 'Mia' will not give a statement",
      "Sean Combs entered the courtroom for his sentencing hearing Friday wearing dark pants and a light-colored sweater over a white button-down. He shook hands with some of his attorneys, hugged others and gestured toward his family crammed into the second and third rows of the gallery.",
      "\"Good morning judge,\" Combs said when greeted by Judge Arun Subramanian.",
      "Subramanian said he receive \"a lot\" of materials ahead of time, including the letter from Combs himself, the video the defense intends to play and an evaluation of the 6-week course Combs taught to fellow inmates at MDC-Brooklyn.",
      "There will be no victim impact statements after a former Combs assistant who testified under the pseudonym \u201cMia\u201d bowed out.",
      "\"This morning the government learned 'Mia' no longer wishes to address the court here today,\" prosecutor Christy Slavik said, adding that a \"bullying\" letter from the defense was part of her reasoning.",
      "\"The tone of the defense's letter was inappropriate,\" Subramanian said. \"That should not be done again.\"",
      "In addition to Combs, two or three of his children and a pastor intend to speak ahead of the imposition of the sentence. Doctors who evaluated Combs are prepared to speak if necessary, defense attorney Brian Steel said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 White House budget director Russ Vought said the Trump administration will withhold $2.1 billion for Chicago infrastructure projects, expanding funding fights that have targeted Democratic areas during the government shutdown.",
      "The pause affects a long-awaited plan to extend the city\u2019s Red Line train. Vought wrote on social media Friday that the money was \u201cput on hold to ensure funding is not flowing via race-based contracting.\u201d",
      "Vought made a similar announcement earlier this week involving New York, where he said $18 billion for infrastructure would be paused, including funding for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River.",
      "Losing the money would be a significant setback for Chicago\u2019s transportation plans. The Red Line extension is slated to add four train stops on the city\u2019s South Side, improving access for disadvantaged communities.",
      "In addition, a broader modernization project for the Red and Purple lines, which Vought said was also being targeted, is intended to upgrade stations and remove a bottleneck where different lines intersect.",
      "President Donald Trump has embraced Vought\u2019s tactics. On Thursday night, he posted a video depicting him as the reaper, wearing a hood and holding a scythe.",
      "In New York's case, Trump\u2019s Transportation Department said it had been reviewing whether any \u201cunconstitutional practices\u201d were occurring in the two massive infrastructure projects but that the government shutdown, which began Wednesday, had forced it to furlough the staffers conducting the review.",

      "Originally charged with first-degree murder, Sweeney instead pleaded guilty in August to lesser second-degree murder charges. At a sentencing hearing Friday, defense lawyers will seek a prison term of 40 years to life, based in part on the \u201cimmeasurable trauma\u201d Sweeney suffered as a child, including a mother who \u201cdragged him through drug dens and a succession of abusive father figures.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are asking the court to grant Eric some measure of mercy,\u201d attorneys Lauren Prusiner and Morgan Taggart-Hampton wrote in a sentencing memorandum made public Thursday.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking consecutive sentences of 35 years to life for Kassandra Sweeney\u2019s death and 40 years to life for each of the boys\u2019 deaths, with up to 18 years suspended if goals related to education, mental health treatment and good behavior are met.",
      "\u201cBenjamin and Mason embody the reason why crimes against children deserve the harshest of penal sanctions. They did absolutely nothing wrong, they were innocent and utterly blameless for what the defendant did,\u201d Assistant Attorney General Bethany Durand wrote in her sentencing memo. \u201cTheir murders deserve separate, consecutive sentences.\u201d",
      "Kassandra Sweeney, a nursing assistant, worked nights so she could care for her boys during the day. On the morning of the killings, she had fixed them a snack and was recording videos of them playing and laughing to send to her husband. Four minutes after she sent the last video, all three were shot in the head, Benjamin through the hood of the dinosaur costume he was wearing.",
      "Sweeney later told police he was in the basement when he heard something break upstairs, a man with a deep voice yelling and multiple \u201cpops,\u201d according to court documents. He said he went upstairs and found his sister-in-law and nephews on the floor bleeding and then took Kassandra\u2019s cellphone and keys and drove away. He then called his brother, who called police.",

      "The Trump administration is tapping National Guard and Army Reserve lawyers to be temporary immigration judges after firing dozens of existing judges",
      "SAN DIEGO -- SAN DIEGO (AP) \u2014 The Trump administration is tapping National Guard and Army Reserve lawyers to be temporary immigration judges after firing dozens of existing judges, the latest step in a broader plan that experts warn could harm immigration courts and the military justice system.",
      "Training for the first group of Army lawyers begins Monday and training for the second group is expected to start in the spring, several former and current military reserve lawyers said they were told. Roughly 100 Army Reserve lawyers are expected to participate, with 50 beginning a nearly six-month assignment immediately after their training, according to a Sept. 3 email sent to an Army Reserve attorney and reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The administration wants to bring in as many as 600 military-trained attorneys to help make decisions about which immigrants can stay in the country. Advocates are alarmed by the move to use military lawyers to bolster staffing in the backlogged immigration courts as President Donald Trump's administration ramps up immigration arrests.",
      "Those courts have yearslong waits for hearings, and the number of pending cases has more than doubled in the past four years to 3.4 million.",
      "Both the Army and National Guard said they hope to fill the assignments with volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis assignment provides the opportunity to gain judicial experience in a high tempo, nationally significant setting,\u201d an email sent to members of the Army\u2019s Reserve Legal Command stated, adding that locations and other details will be released later.",
      "A notification seeking volunteers sent Sept. 6 to active-duty and reserve National Guard members said \u201cideal candidates will possess experience in administrative law, immigration law, service as a military judge\u201d or a related field. Applicants should have sound judgment, impartiality and a \u201csuitable temperament for the role,\u201d it said.",
      "The Trump administration increasingly has turned to the military to support its crackdown on illegal immigration. That has included troops patrolling the U.S.-Mexico border, National Guard members being sent into U.S. cities to support immigration enforcement efforts, housing people awaiting deportation on military bases, and using military aircraft to carry out deportations.",
      "Immigration judges each manage hundreds or thousands of cases, deciding who gets asylum and green cards to stay in the U.S. Their rulings shape both the lives of immigrant families and the success of Trump\u2019s crackdown.",
      "Some immigration and military law experts are concerned the reservists will be put in the job without enough training or experience after more than 100 immigration judges were fired or left.",
      "With only about 600 immigration judges remaining, the Pentagon move would double their ranks. Trump\u2019s sweeping new tax and spending law provided $170 billion for immigration enforcement, including the hiring of 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees, but it caps the number of permanent immigration judges at 800.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re letting a lot of experienced judges go, terminating them with no notice, and yet they claim that there\u2019s a shortage so they need to have these military JAG officers step in and take over,\u201d said Margaret Stock, a retired Army lieutenant colonel and immigration lawyer.",
      "Of particular concern, the administration is not requiring experience as an administrative law judge or in immigration law as in the past, she said. Stock has taught seminars on immigration law at West Point but said military lawyers learn only a minimal amount to be able to help fellow service members with things like visas for spouses or children.",
      "\u201cImmigration law is super technical and complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse than tax law, and it\u2019s constantly changing. And it has its own terminology, its own rules that don\u2019t make any sense.\u201d",
      "Immigration judges come from a range of legal backgrounds, including the military, the Justice Department, immigration enforcement agencies, and private practice. The government previously required applicants to have seven years' experience before undergoing a lengthy hiring process, then six weeks of training followed by a two-year probation period.",
      "Until now, temporary judges needed 10 years of legal experience in immigration, and were often retired immigration judges, according to the government's rule laying out the new plan.",
      "The Defense Department did not return an email seeking comment. The Executive Office for Immigration Review, which runs the immigration courts, declined to comment. In the rule, the agency wrote that many successful immigration judges had little experience in immigration law before taking the job.",

They study at accredited law schools and pass the bar exam before going into a military law program for just over two months. They sometimes work as special assistants to U.S. attorneys and gather evidence to prosecute criminal cases, much like civilian prosecutors do, said Mark Nevitt, a former Navy JAG and associate professor at Emory University School of Law.",
      "\u201cThey are some of the greatest lawyers you\u2019ll meet in the national security world,\u201d but this will require they \u201cget up to speed pretty quickly on a complex body of law and then adjudicate matters and claims as a judge,\u201d Nevitt said.",
      "Matt Biggs, president of a federal employee union that represents immigration judges, said tapping lawyers with little or no immigration experience to hear these complex, high-stakes cases will likely do more harm than good.",
      "\u201cIt will lead to more appeals of decisions. It will further increase the backlog. It\u2019s going to be an inefficient and costly endeavor,\u201d Biggs said. \u201cIt sets a dangerous precedent in this country when it comes to due process protections.\u201d",
      "Gregory Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association said the Justice Department is \u201cwatering down the qualifications of those it will empower to make life-or-death decisions.\u201d",
      "He also worries the administration will hold too much sway over the temporary hires. The permanent judges are government employees with civil service protections.",
      "Some Democratic senators have warned the Pentagon plan may violate the Posse Comitatus Act, which bans service members from carrying out law enforcement duties, and fear taking away the JAGs could harm the military justice system. They sent a letter to the offices of the top military lawyers for the four services, asking where the roughly 600 lawyers will be coming from and what legal analysis the military has conducted.",
      "A Pentagon memo describing the plan said the appointments should be for no longer than six months. The memo also said the Justice Department would be responsible for ensuring the military lawyers don't violate the Posse Comitatus Act.",
      "If the military lawyers serve entirely under civilian personnel then it could be legal, Nevitt said, but it's unclear.",
      "Some immigrant advocates believe the administration is presuming military lawyers are more likely to deny cases to meet Trump\u2019s deportation goals.",
      "But Greg Rinckey, a former Army lawyer who is now in private practice, said that assumption is wrong.",

      "The death comes on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks \u201cgenerally\u201d open, with limited operations and closed visitors centers, according to the National Park Service.

      "The Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Washington state produced plutonium for most of America's nuclear arsenal through the end of the Cold War",
      "SEATTLE -- For much of the 20th century, a sprawling complex in the desert of southeastern Washington state turned out most of the plutonium used in the nation\u2019s nuclear arsenal, from the first atomic bomb to the arms race that fueled the Cold War.",
      "Now, after decades of planning and billions of dollars of investment, the site is turning liquid nuclear and chemical waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation into a much safer substance: glass.",
      "State regulators on Wednesday issued the final permit Hanford needed for workers to remove more waste from often-leaky underground tanks, mix it in a crucible with additives, and heat it above 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,000 Celsius). The mixture then cools in stainless steel vats and solidifies into glass \u2014 still radioactive, but far more stable to keep in storage, and less likely to seep into the soil or the nearby Columbia River.",
      "The long-awaited development is a key step in cleaning up the nation's most polluted nuclear waste site. Construction on the Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant began in 2002.",
      "\u201cWe are at the precipice of a really significant moment in Hanford\u2019s history,\u201d said Casey Sixkiller, director of the Washington State Department of Ecology, in a video interview.",
      "The roughly 600-square-mile (1500-square-km) reservation is near the confluence of two of the Pacific Northwest\u2019s most significant rivers, the Snake and the Columbia, in an area important to Native American tribes for millennia.",
      "Wartime planners selected the area because it was isolated and had access to cold water and hydroelectric power. In early 1943, the U.S. government seized the land for a secret project, displacing roughly 2,000 residents, including farmers.",
      "Tens of thousands of workers then responded to newspaper ads around the country promising good jobs to support the Allied effort to defeat Nazi Germany and Japan in World War II, and a new company town arose in the desert.",
      "Most of the workers had no idea they were involved in building the world's first full-scale plutonium production reactor until the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, and President Harry S. Truman announced the existence of the Manhattan Project to the world.",
      "Hanford would grow to include nine nuclear reactors churning out plutonium for the nation's nuclear arsenal. The last of these was shut down in 1987. Two years later, Washington state, the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached an agreement to clean up the site.",
      "Seven of the nine reactors have been \u201ccocooned\u201d to prevent contamination from escaping until radiation levels drop enough to allow for dismantling, near the end of the century.",
      "There are also 177 giant underground tanks that hold some 56 million gallons (212 million liters) of highly radioactive and chemically hazardous waste. Those tanks are well past their projected lifespan of 25 years. More than one-third have leaked in the past, and three are currently leaking.",
      "During its years producing plutonium for nuclear weapons, Hanford dumped effluent directly into the Columbia River and into ineffective containment ponds, polluting the surrounding groundwater and contaminating the food chain of wildlife that depends on it, according to a 2013 government assessment.",

There are plans for two facilities at Hanford: the one now approved to process low-level nuclear waste after repeated delays, and an adjacent facility for the high-level waste that remains under construction.",
      "More than $30 billion has been spent on the plants so far. The U.S. Department of Energy, which oversees Hanford, has faced an Oct. 15 deadline to have turned some of its stored waste into glass, per a cleanup schedule and consent decree involving the EPA and Washington state.",
      "The first waste to be mixed with glass will include pretreated radioactive cesium and strontium, according to a statement from the Department of Energy.",
      "The Energy Department fired Roger Jarrell, its main overseer of the Hanford cleanup, earlier this month, prompting concerns about the Trump administration's commitment. Democratic Sen. Patty Murray said Energy Secretary Chris Wright told her by phone that he was looking to stall the vitrification operations.",
      "That prompted outrage from Washington state officials. Gov. Bob Ferguson, joined at a news conference by tribal leaders and labor representatives, threatened legal action.",

      "A new study shows that the world's most damaging wildfires are happening four times more often now compared to the 1980s",
      "WASHINGTON -- Earth\u2019s nastiest and costliest wildfires are blazing four times more often now than they did in the 1980s because of human-caused climate change and people moving closer to wildlands, a new study found.",
      "A study in the journal Science looks at global wildfires, not by acres burned which is the most common measuring stick, but by the harder to calculate economic and human damage they cause. The study concluded there has been a \u201cclimate-linked escalation of societally disastrous wildfires.\u201d",
      "A team of Australian, American and German fire scientists calculated the 200 most damaging fires since 1980 based on the percentage of damage to the country's Gross Domestic Product at the time, taking inflation into account. The frequency of these events has increased about 4.4 times from 1980 to 2023, said study lead author Calum Cunningham, a pyrogeographer at the Fire Centre at the University of Tasmania in Australia.",
      "\u201cIt shows beyond a shadow of a doubt that we do have a major wildfire crisis on our hands,\u201d Cunningham said.",
      "About 43% of the 200 most damaging fires occurred in the last 10 years of the study. In the 1980s, the globe averaged two of these catastrophic fires a year and a few times hit four a year. From 2014 to 2023, the world averaged nearly nine a year, including 13 in 2021. It noted that the count of these devastating infernos sharply increased in 2015, which \u201ccoincided with increasingly extreme climatic conditions.\u201d Though the study date ended in 2023, the last two years have been even more extreme, Cunningham said.",
      "Europe and North America lead in the number of these economically damaging fires. It's especially worse in the Mediterranean around Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal and in the Western United States around California, because of the climate prone to sudden dryness, worsened by global warming, Cunningham said.",
      "The researchers also found a tripling in how often a single fire killed at least 10 people, such as 2018's Paradise fire, 2023's Lahaina fire and those in Los Angeles in 2025.",
      "Cunningham said often researchers look at how many acres a fire burns as a measuring stick, but he called that flawed because it really doesn't show the effect on people, with area not mattering as much as economics and lives. Hawaii's Lahaina fire wasn't big, but it burned a lot of buildings and killed a lot of people so it was more meaningful than one in sparsely populated regions, he said.",
      "\u201cWe need to be targeting the fires that matter. And those are the fires that cause major ecological destruction because they\u2019re burning too intensely,\u201d Cunningham said.",
      "But economic data is difficult to get with many countries keeping that information private, preventing global trends and totals from being calculated. So Cunningham and colleagues were able to get more than 40 years of global economic date from insurance giant Munich Re and then combine it with the public database from International Disaster Database, which isn't as complete but is collected by the Catholic University of Louvain in Belgium.",
      "The study looked at \u201cfire weather\u201d which is hot, dry and windy conditions that make extreme fires more likely and more dangerous and found that those conditions are increasing, creating a connection to the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.",

      "If there was no human-caused climate change, the world would still have devastating fires, but not as many, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re loading the dice in a sense by increasing temperatures.\u201d",
      "There are other factors. People are moving closer to fire-prone areas, called the wildland-urban interface, Cunningham said. And society is not getting a handle on dead foliage that becomes fuel, he said. But those factors are harder to quantify compared to climate change, he said.",
      "\"This is an innovative study in terms of the data sources employed, and it mostly confirms common sense expectations: fires causing major fatalities and economic damage tend to be those in densely populated areas and to occur during the extreme fire weather conditions that are becoming more common due to climate change,\" said Jacob Bendix, a geography and environment professor at Syracuse University who studies fires, but wasn't part of this research team.",
      "Not only does the study makes sense, but it's a bad sign for the future, said Mike Flannigan, a fire researcher at Thompson Rivers University in Canada. Flannigan, who wasn't part of research, said: \"As the frequency and intensity of extreme fire weather and drought increases the likelihood of disastrous fires increases so we need to do more to be better prepared.\"",

      "Shutdowns of the federal government usually don\u2019t leave much economic damage",
      "WASHINGTON -- Shutdowns of the federal government usually don't leave much economic damage. But the one that started Wednesday looks riskier, not least because President Donald Trump is threatening to use the standoff to permanently eliminate thousands of government jobs and the state of the economy is already precarious.",
      "For now, financial markets are shrugging off the impasse as just the latest failure of Republicans and Democrats to agree on a budget and keep the government running.",
      "\u201cEveryone seems quite complacent about the shutdown, assuming the Democrats and Republicans will come to terms and life will go on, as has been the case in past shutdowns,\u201d the independent economist Ed Yardeni wrote in a commentary Thursday. \"History could certainly repeat, especially with a man known for dealmaking sitting in the Oval Office.''",
      "But given the chasm separating the two political parties, Yardeni added, \"the lack of caution is somewhat surprising.''",
      "The U.S. government has now shut down 21 times in the past half century. The last of those shutdowns was the longest \u2014 stretching five weeks in December 2018 into January 2019 during Trump's first term.",
      "Even that one barely left a mark on the world's biggest economy: The Congressional Budget Office estimates that it shaved just 0.02% off 2019 U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services.",
      "The economic impact of shutdowns is usually fleeting. Federal workers get furloughed and the federal government delays some spending while they last. When they\u2019re over, federal workers go back to their jobs and collect back pay, and the government belatedly spends the money it had withheld. It\u2019s pretty much a wash.",
      "\u201cGovernment shutdowns are inconvenient and messy,\u2033 said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at the investment firm Global X. \u201dBut there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy. Typically, the lost economic activity, if meaningful in the first place, is recovered in the following quarter.\u2033",
      "Government benefit payments that provide crucial income support for millions of Americans, such as Social Security, and health care programs such as Medicare, won\u2019t be disrupted by the shutdown.",
      "Data from previous shutdowns have shown little impact on U.S. GDP unless they are extended, according to CBO Director Phillip Swagel. \u201cThe impact is not immediate, but over time, there is a negative impact of a shutdown on the economy,\u201d he recently told The Associated Press.",
      "The damage could be worse this go-around.",
      "First, some government agencies dodged the 2018-2019 shutdown because they'd received funding in advance and could just continue operating. That hasn't happened this time: The CBO estimates that about 750,000 federal employees could be temporarily laid off.",
      "Trump is also considering something more destructive: His budget office has threatened the mass firing of federal workers this time, not just putting them on temporary furlough.",

They\u2019re going to be Democrats,\" the president said Tuesday.",
      "Thomas Ryan of Capital Economics wrote in a commentary that \u201cit is reasonable to assume that (Trump\u2019s mass layoff threat) is political bluster, aimed at pressuring Democrats to approve a funding extension without concessions.\u201d But, he added, \u201cif followed through, it could have longer-term consequences, prolonging government downsizing and keeping the sector as a drag on payrolls into next year.\"",
      "Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, estimates that the shutdown and temporary loss of income for federal workers could shave 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points from the nation's annual growth rate in the fourth quarter for each week the government is closed. Some of that will be recovered once it reopens.",
      "\u201cThe economic costs of government shutdowns are normally minimal unless they last for several weeks,\u201d Sweet wrote.",
      "The showdown also comes at a time when the job market is already under strain, damaged by the lingering effects of high interest rates and uncertainty around Trump's erratic campaign to slap taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and on specific products \u2014 from copper to foreign films.",
      "Labor Department revisions earlier this month showed that the economy created 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year that ended in March. That meant that employers added an average of fewer than 71,000 new jobs a month over that period, not the 147,000 first reported. Since March, job creation has slowed even more \u2014 to an average 53,000 a month. During the 2021-2023 hiring boom that followed COVID-19 lockdowns, by contrast, the economy was creating 400,000 jobs a month.",
      "The September jobs report was supposed to come out Friday \u2014 forecasters had expected to see 50,000 new jobs last month \u2014 but has been delayed indefinitely by the shutdown.",
      "The economy is sending mixed signals, however. GDP growth came in at a strong 3.8% annual pace from April through June, reversing a 0.6% drop in the first three months of the year. But it's not yet clear if that solid growth can continue, or if it will spur a rebound in hiring.",
      "\u201cThe economy is very much on a \u2018knife\u2019s edge,\u2019\u201d said Michael Linden, senior policy fellow at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cThe economic data is pointing in different directions right now. Second-quarter GDP growth was strong, but how much of that was merely a bounce back from incredibly weak first quarter GDP is hard to know. What we know for sure is that the economy is creating fewer jobs, wage growth is slowing, and middle-class consumers are feeling pinched.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is asking nine major universities to commit to President Donald Trump\u2019s political priorities in exchange for more favorable access to federal money.",
      "Universities were asked to sign a \u201cCompact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education\u201d committing them to adopt the White House\u2019s vision for America\u2019s campuses. It asks the schools to accept the government\u2019s priorities on admissions, women\u2019s sports, free speech, student discipline and college affordability, among other topics.",
      "Signing on would give universities priority access to some federal grants, but government money would not be limited solely to those schools, according to a White House official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the plan and spoke on condition of anonymity. Colleges that agree would also have priority access to White House events and discussions with officials.",
      "The compact, obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, asks universities to accept the government\u2019s definition of gender and apply it to campus bathrooms, locker rooms and women\u2019s sports teams. It asks colleges to stop considering race, gender and a wide range of other student demographics in the admissions process and to require undergraduate applicants to take the SAT or ACT.",
      "The 10-page proposed agreement was sent Wednesday to some of the most selective public and private universities: Vanderbilt, the University of Pennsylvania, Dartmouth College, the University of Southern California, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Texas, the University of Arizona, Brown University and the University of Virginia. It was not clear how these schools were selected or why, and whether similar offers might go out to other colleges.",
      "Leaders of the Texas system were \u201chonored\u201d that the Austin campus was chosen to be a part of the compact and its \u201cpotential funding advantages,\u201d according to a statement from Kevin Eltife, chair of the Board of Regents. \u201cToday we welcome the new opportunity presented to us and we look forward to working with the Trump Administration on it,\u201d Eltife said.",
      "Representatives from the other colleges did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The administration has used its control of federal funding as leverage at several other colleges, cutting off research money at schools including Harvard and Columbia as it has sought changes to the schools' governance and policies.",
      "Under the compact, international enrollment would have to be capped at 15% of a college\u2019s undergraduate student body \u2014 many elite schools are now above that \u2014 and no more than 5% could come from a single country.",

      "Despite Goodall\u2019s enduring passion to observe wild animals in Africa, she didn\u2019t have a college degree when she arrived there in 1957, starting as an assistant secretary at a natural history museum in Nairobi.",
      "Famed anthropologist and paleontologist Louis Leakey gave her the job and later invited her to search for fossils with him and his wife at the Olduvai Gorge. After seeing her grit and determination, Leakey asked if she would be interested in studying chimpanzees in what is now Tanzania.",

      "It wasn\u2019t until 1966 that she earned a Ph.D. in ethology \u2014 becoming one of the few people admitted to University of Cambridge as a Ph.D. candidate without a college degree.",
      "While first studying chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1960s, Goodall didn\u2019t spend her days simply observing the animals from afar and giving them numbers like other scientists.",
      "She immersed herself in every aspect of their lives, feeding them and giving them names and forming what can only be described as personal relationships with them. The approach was criticized by some scientists who saw it as an alarming lack of scientific detachment.",
      "Goodall documented chimpanzees in a wide array of activities widely believed at the time to be exclusive to humans, including showing their ruthlessly violent side during what she described as \u201cwarfare.\u201d",
      "She described seeing a group systematically hunt down and kill members of a smaller group over the course of four years. The war ended only after every member of the smaller group was dead.",
      "\u201cIt was a shock to find that they could show such brutal behavior,\u201d she said in 2003. \u201cThat made them seem even more like us then I thought before.\u201d",

      "Since Goodall could crawl, she\u2019d had a fascination with animals. When she bought her first book at the age of 10 \u2014 Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 \u201cTarzan of the Apes\u201d \u2014 her vision for the future started to solidify. She planned to travel to Africa and live with the wild animals.",

      "Karen Attiah, a former opinion columnist at The Washington Post, says she was fired after social media posts expressing concerns about gun violence and rhetoric against Black women",
      "As the founding global opinion editor for The Washington Post, Karen Attiah believed her job had always been about assessing world affairs in a way that elevated a diverse range of perspectives.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not just a columnist,\u201d she recently said.",
      "But last week, the Post\u2019s only Black female opinion writer revealed she had been fired over posts on Bluesky about violent white men in the wake of Charlie Kirk\u2019s killing that the newspaper said violated its social media policy. After offering what she called an \u201chonest reflection on the state of violence in America,\u201d her 11 years at the Post came to an abrupt end.",
      "\u201cBeing pushed out of the Washington Post for expressing myself \u2014 for not even expressing myself, for doing my job as a journalist \u2014 is really a deep, sort of cruel 180,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "The firing of Attiah, the last Black full-time member on the Post\u2019s opinion desk, worries media professionals and advocacy organizations about the wider implications for journalistic freedom and diversity. The potential fallout, they say, could make journalists of color hesitant to express opinions or address injustices, effectively muting those perspectives.",
      "The National Association of Black Journalists, the nation's largest professional advocacy organization for journalists of color, said Tuesday that Attiah's firing had \u201craised an alarm about the erosion of Black voices across the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe absence of Black journalists doesn\u2019t just harm us \u2014 it impoverishes the entire profession,\" said NABJ President Errin Haines. \"When our voices are missing, stories go untold, perspectives go unchallenged, and the truth remains incomplete.\u201d",
      "After a meeting Monday with Washington Post Executive Editor Matt Murray, NABJ leadership said it had assurances that the news outlet is working to retain diversity among its staff and to expand access to careers for journalists of color.",
      "A Washington Post spokesperson declined the AP\u2019s request to comment on Attiah\u2019s firing. Attiah has announced plans to dispute the Post\u2019s decision in court.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more sort of about this chilling precedent that it sets for journalists, for educators, for researchers, for anyone who writes on gender and violence. If they think it\u2019s going to stop with me just because I was a Black woman saying this, it never stops with just Black people,\u201d Attiah said.",
      "Attiah\u2019s firing comes among dozens of others across various professions stemming from comments about Kirk's assassination, igniting a debate over First Amendment rights as President Donald Trump has vowed retribution for remarks he considers disparaging.",
      "\"The removal of vital voices like Karen Attiah\u2019s \u2014 whose reporting helps our communities understand the political context we\u2019re in \u2014 is a dangerous and deliberate act of erasure by media owners,\u201d the Media 2070 Project, a nonpartisan organization advocating for a free press and exchange of ideas, said in a statement.",
      "The president of the Washington Association of Black Journalists, of which Attiah is a member, said the firing is a \u201cchilling moment in news media,\u201d particularly for Black journalists, whose voices have historically been targeted.",
      "\u201cThis firing sends a message to other Black journalists and writers that our perspectives aren\u2019t valued unless we align with the status quo,\u201d WABJ President Philip Lewis told the AP.",
      "For many media diversity advocates, Attiah\u2019s firing reflects a history of excluding Black women and their perspectives from white owned and run news outlets \u2014 like journalist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, whose reporting on lynchings of Black Americans in the 1890s was dismissed and attacked by mainstream papers.",
      "\u201cOften, it\u2019s the people who get left out of the frame and left out of the division of the nation that are the ones saying, \u2018Actually, we can think about this better,\u2019\u201d said Khadijah Costley White, associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, who specializes in writing and commentary on race, social movements, news and politics.",

      "Eric Deggans, the Knight Chair in Journalism and Media Ethics at Washington and Lee University, said the Post\u2019s loss of Attiah is glaring at a time when \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of other public figures out there criticizing Black women unfairly.\u201d",

      "According to the Pew Research Center\u2019s most recent survey of the news media, just 6% of all reporting journalists were Black in 2022, even though 12% of the U.S. total population is Black. By comparison, 76% of all reporting journalists were white, though the white population makes up 61% of the U.S. total.",
      "Diversity can help encourage public debate, according to University of Michigan journalism professor Daniel K. Brown, an analyst of media representation and narrative change. Opinion pieces often attract more social engagement because they\u2019re clear, singular viewpoints that help readers understand what is happening and spark discussion, he said.",
      "\u201cProbably one of the biggest consequences of not having lots of diversity in this space \u2014 or more diversity in the space \u2014 is its potential to also just misinform the public, which is already a little confused about what opinion writing is and what it\u2019s supposed to do in the first place,\u201d Brown said.",
      "But a columnist\u2019s personal social media presence and institutional role can also create tensions or jeopardize an outlet\u2019s credibility and trust with the public, said Daniel Kreiss, a professor of political communication at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He suggests that being transparent about one\u2019s personal views allows the public to understand the lens through which the opinion columnist is writing.",
      "\u201cPublic opinion is not a static thing,\u201d Kreiss said. \u201cIt changes when people bring arguments and ideas into the public sphere \u2014 whether by persuading others, winning supporters, or simply prompting people to consider something they\u2019ve never thought about before.\u201d",
      "Attiah said she has been consistent about her views on issues of race and has been making appearances since her firing to share her perspective on the current political climate.",
      "\u201cI hate to be Debbie Dark Cloud, but if you think things are really bad, they can and they will, and they\u2019re trying to make it worse,\u201d Attiah said during a panel on Black women in media at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual conference last week.",
      "But Attiah also struck a note of optimism about the potential the moment brings for Black thinkers, leaders and organizers.",
      "\u201cI think this is also a time for profound creativity, being like water rising and like water moving around the cracks and actually, over time, eroding and undoing,\u201d she said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump has seized on the government shutdown as an opportunity to reshape the federal workforce and punish detractors, by threatening mass firings of workers and suggesting \u201cirreversible\u201d cuts to programs important to Democrats.",
      "Rather than simply furlough employees, as is usually done during any lapse of funds, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said layoffs were \u201cimminent.\u201d The Office of Management and Budget announced it was putting on hold roughly $18 billion of infrastructure funds for New York's subway and Hudson Tunnel projects \u2014 in the hometown of the Democratic leaders of the U.S. House and Senate.",
      "Trump has marveled over the handiwork of his budget director.",
      "\u201cHe can trim the budget to a level that you couldn\u2019t do any other way,\" the president said at the start of the week of OMB Director Russ Vought, who was also a chief architect of the Project 2025 conservative policy book.",
      "\"So they're taking a risk by having a shutdown,\u201d Trump said during an event at the White House.",
      "Thursday is day two of the shutdown, and already the dial is turned high. The aggressive approach coming from the Trump administration is what certain lawmakers and budget observers feared if Congress, which has the responsibility to pass legislation to fund government, failed to do its work and relinquished control to the White House.",
      "Vought, in a private conference call with House GOP lawmakers Wednesday afternoon, told them of layoffs starting in the next day or two. It\u2019s an extension of the Department of Government Efficiency work under Elon Musk that slashed through the federal government at the start of the year.",
      "\u201cThese are all things that the Trump administration has been doing since January 20th,\u201d said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, referring to the president\u2019s first day in office. \u201cThe cruelty is the point.\u201d",
      "With no easy endgame at hand, the standoff risks dragging deeper into October, when federal workers who remain on the job will begin missing paychecks. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated roughly 750,000 federal workers would be furloughed on any given day during the shutdown, a loss of $400 million daily in wages.",
      "The economic effects could spill over into the broader economy. Past shutdowns saw \u201creduced aggregate demand in the private sector for goods and services, pushing down GDP,\u201d the CBO said.",
      "\"Stalled federal spending on goods and services led to a loss of private-sector income that further reduced demand for other goods and services in the economy,\" it said. Overall CBO said there was a \u201cdampening of economic output,\u201d but that reversed once people returned to work.",
      "\u201cThe longer this goes on, the more pain will be inflicted,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., \u201cbecause it is inevitable when the government shuts down.\u201d",

      "That would ensure Trump's immigration enforcement and mass deportation agenda is uninterrupted. But employees who remain on the job at many other agencies will have to wait for government to reopen before they get a paycheck.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

      "The trend involves children and teens imitating a scene from the hit streaming movie by eating hot instant noodles, but doctors say it has become dangerous.",
      "Injuries are coming from both the temperature of the noodles and hot water being spilled, Dr. Colleen Ryan, a burn care specialist at Shriners Children's Boston and Harvard Medical School surgery professor, told CBS News.",
      "\"Most of the time, it's when the children open the microwave themselves. Microwave is usually up high, and they reach in and it's a little too hot for them,\" she said, adding the clinic has been seeing two to three burn cases a week from the trend.",
      "Not only is a burn painful, but they can leave a lifelong scar and cause emotional distress, Ryan said.",
      "The American Burn Association says a scalding injury for adults can occur after contact with 155 degree water for one second, but children's skin is thinner, making it easier to burn. A recent study at the University of Chicago found 31% of childhood scald admissions were caused by instant noodles.",
      "Ryan said post-burn first aid is important.",
      "\"20 minutes of cool water,\" she advised. \"Then you need to call for help.\"",

Although she she says she has good insurance, it has repeatedly failed to cover the specialty medication her doctor prescribed to slow the progression of her disease. In 2024, when her physician recommended a treatment that could help, she says her insurance company denied coverage three times. She was only approved after the Maryland attorney general intervened.",

      "Planned Parenthood's two clinics in Louisiana closed on Tuesday over challenges that the organization said made it unfeasible to operate there.",
      "The clinics were in Baton Rouge and New Orleans.",
      "The president of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast said the closures were forced by \"compounding political attacks that have dismantled public health infrastructure, (and) blocked patients from care.\"",
      "The closures follow a court ruling last month that affected the clinics' ability to accept Medicaid reimbursements for providing patient care, by clearing the way for a provision of President Trump's tax and spending bill to be implemented.",
      "\"A federal court has allowed the Trump administration's 'defunding' of Planned Parenthood to take effect, blocking patients with Medicaid from accessing care in our health centers,\" the organization said in mid-September.",
      "Planned Parenthood said \u2060Texas has barred the organization from the state's Medicaid program since 2021, but that the latest ruling means Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast can no longer accept Medicaid in its Louisiana health centers.\u2060",
      "Planned Parenthood has warned of other possible closures nationwide amid Medicaid funding cuts in Mr. Trump's spending and tax bill, which instructs the government to halt Medicaid payments for a year to certain abortion providers.",
      "But while many Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the clinics in Louisiana that closed had not offered abortion services at any time in their 40-year history, according to the New Orleans Health Department. Planned Parenthood has never had a license to perform abortions in Louisiana, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Last year, the clinic in New Orleans served about 16,000 patients for sexually transmitted infection care and testing, and almost 9,000 patients for family planning care, including birth control and pregnancy tests, according to Planned Parenthood data provided by the New Orleans Health Department.",
      "\"We know that Planned Parenthood New Orleans on Claiborne Avenue served tens of thousands of patients a year with sexual and reproductive health services, and that clinic was important, because it was open access for people who were uninsured or underinsured people who didn't feel comfortable going elsewhere,\" said Jeannie Donovan, deputy director of population health and disease prevention at the New Orleans Health Department. \"It served a real need in our community.\"",
      "Donovan said her department has been working hard to fill the gap for people who relied on the New Orleans clinic for health care needs, creating new maps and databases for patients to find new primary care options.",
      "The clinics in New Orleans and Baton Rouge provided nearly 30,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections, as well 1,800 cancer screenings and 655 ultrasounds. They saw 14,400 visits for birth control, the AP reported.",
      "\"While this chapter closes, community leaders and stakeholders continue to explore possible pathways to carry forward the mission of advancing sexual and reproductive health and rights in Louisiana,\" said Melaney Linton, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, in a statement to CBS News. \"Though that future will not be possible through PPGC, the need remains urgent, and this fight is not over.\"",
      "Some, however, cheered the closures. Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said on social media Tuesday, \"This is a win for babies, a win for mothers, and a win for LIFE!\"",
      "\"Planned Parenthood built its business around promoting death,\" said Attorney General Liz Murrill. \"Louisiana proudly stands for life. We will always protect women and babies here in our State.\"",
      "Planned Parenthood said in July that 200 clinics \u2014 of about 600 \u2014 across the U.S. are also at risk of closing as a result of federal policy changes and funding cuts, although the organization is trying to have its funding restored through the courts.",
      "Last week, Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin announced it would stop scheduling abortions, and the Arizona affiliate announced it would stop providing care to people covered by Medicaid. Those changes come after five clinics in California, as well as eight in Iowa and Minnesota, closed their doors earlier this year.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 15:10:37 -0400",
    "summary": "With time running out to avert a government shutdown, millions of Americans who get health insurance under the Affordable Care Act could soon face sharply higher premiums.",
    "story": [
      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",
      "\"Being proactive will help minimize financial surprises,\" Norris said.",

      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",

The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",
      "According to a White House official, a letter outlining the plan and a copy of the agreement were sent on Wednesday to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas, University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.",
      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",
      "A copy of the letter sent to universities obtained by CBS News notes that schools that agree to the compact will receive \"allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.\"",
      "The letter is signed by Mailman; Secretary of Education Linda McMahon; and Vince Haley, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. It asks for written comments from the universities by \"no later than October 20.\"",
      "\"After receiving feedback, schools that show clear alignment and a strong readiness to champion this effort will be invited to the White House to finalize language and be initial signatories,\" the letter says. \"We are aiming to have a signed agreement by no later than November 21, 2025.\"",
      "The Department of Education did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Prioritizing U.S. students",
      "A University of Virginia spokesperson said its interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has created a working group to advise him on how to respond to the letter. \"The University has not yet made any decision regarding the compact,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The University of Southern California said it is reviewing the letter. In a statement to CBS News, Vanderbilt said that \"We look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.\" MIT acknowledged receiving the material but declined further comment.",
      "The other universities did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the Harvard funding freeze was illegal.",

    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 11:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",

That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",

      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",

      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",

      "The government shutdown could lead to more job cuts, with the White House Office of Management and Budget last week\u00a0telling federal agencies\u00a0to consider layoffs during a closure.",
      "The report comes as the monthly government jobs report, scheduled to be released on Oct. 3, is likely to be delayed due to this week's\u00a0government shutdown. Economists are forecasting that employers added 50,000 jobs last month, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "In the absence of the government's monthly jobs report, other measures of the labor market's health are drawing more attention from economists. On Wednesday, ADP said that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs in September.",
      "However, some signs suggest that the pace of layoffs is easing, with Challenger's data showing that businesses announced roughly 54,000 job cuts in September, a 37% drop from the nearly 86,000 cuts announced in August.",
      "The Federal Reserve is monitoring the labor market for signs of weakness, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month citing the headwinds facing workers as the primary reason the central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by\u00a00.25 percentage points. The Fed is penciling in two additional rate cuts for the remainder of 2025.",
      "A decline in borrowing costs for businesses and consumers could help bolster the job market, Challenger said. As interest rates fall, businesses have more flexibility to expand and hire more workers.",
      "\"Right now, we're dealing with a stagnating labor market, cost increases and a transformative new technology. With rate cuts on the way, we may see some stabilizing in the job market in the fourth quarter, but other factors could keep employers planning layoffs or holding off hiring,\" Challenger said.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 18:19:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Data shows government shutdowns tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader U.S. economy.",
    "story": [
      "Stocks closed at record highs Wednesday despite a U.S. government shutdown\u00a0expected to idle hundreds of thousands of workers and hobble federal agencies charged with dispensing a range of critical services. So why do investors seem unfazed?",
      "Although shutdowns have serious, real-world consequences for millions of Americans, data shows they tend to have a modest impact on financial markets and the broader economy, especially if the closure is brief.",
      "\"Most of the economic activity is delayed and usually gets made up shortly after a shutdown ends,\" Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, told CBS News. \"So I can't imagine this will be anything terribly disruptive for the equity markets.\"",
      "Over the previous 22 shutdowns the U.S. has seen since 1976, the S&P 500 rose during some of the closures while falling at other times. Overall, the stock index gained an average of 0.3% during the episodes, according to an analysis from Carson Group (see chart).",
      "What's more, the stock index jumped 13% on average in the 12 months following the shutdowns, the asset management firm found.",
      "\"Government shutdowns are inconvenient and messy, but there is little evidence that they have a significant impact on the economy,\" said Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in a report.",
      "During the longest shutdown in U.S. history, which started in December 2018 and extended into January of the following year, some 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or worked without pay. That put many employees under severe financial pressure, driving some to food banks and others to launch online fundraising campaigns.",
      "Yet for the $30 trillion U.S. economy as a whole, that lost income amounted to a drop in the bucket, noted Thomas Ryan, North America economist at investment advisory firm Capital Economics. Consumption across the U.S. dipped for the two months the government remained partially shuttered, but quickly recovered.",
      "With Wall Street shrugging off the headlines on Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed up 0.3%, topping the all-time high it set last week. The blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished in record territory.",
      "Why this time could be different",
      "The caveat? History is a guide \u2014 not a guarantee that events will follow the same script. The political dynamics driving the latest meltdown in Congress obviously differ from those that shaped previous eras, making it hard to predict how long the latest shutdown will last. An impasse lasting a month or more would fuel market uncertainty and could shake investor confidence, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Right now uncertainty is picking up again with new tariffs announced last week, and this just adds to it, which can paralyze growth for the foreseeable future,\" economist Daniel Altman and author of newsletter High Yield Economics, told CBS News. \"It makes it harder for stocks to continue rising if nobody knows what the fiscal picture is going to be like for the next year.\"",
      "If the shutdown drags on, companies could also press pause on making investment and hiring decisions, which would weigh on stock prices, Altman said.",
      "The latest closure will have another immediate impact that could fray investor nerves \u2014 halting the flow of economic reports that experts use to assess everything from the rate of inflation to the pace of job growth. Without critical data, investors could start to feel like they are \"flying blind,\" Vital Knowledge market analyst Adam Crisafulli said in a report.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",
      "A post shared by Tilly Norwood (@tillynorwood)",
      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 15:09:13 -0400",
    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "summary": "A federal district ruled in September that President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors was likely illegal.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will hear arguments in January on whether President Trump can fire Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "The high court said in a brief unsigned order that it is not yet acting on Mr. Trump's request for emergency relief. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court last month to freeze a lower court order that found Cook's purported removal was likely illegal and allowed her to remain a Fed governor.",
      "By deferring a decision on the president's bid for emergency relief, Cook can remain in her position on the Fed's Board of Governors for now.",
      "Cook participated in a two-day meeting of the Fed's interest-rate-setting committee last month, which culminated with the central bank announcing its first cut to its benchmark interest rate in nine months. The panel will meet next in October and December.",
      "Her lawyers warned the Supreme Court that allowing Mr. Trump to remove Cook from the board of governors even for a brief period would have severe consequences, risking chaos and disruption of financial markets.",
      "Accepting the president's argument, Cook's lawyers said, \"would eviscerate the Federal Reserve's longstanding independence, upend financial markets, and create a blueprint for future presidents to direct monetary policy based on their political agendas and election calendars.\"",
      "But they warned it would also open the Fed up to political influence. Granting Mr. Trump the emergency relief he sought would \"sound the death knell\" for the Fed's independence\" and transform it into a body that is \"subservient to the President's will,\" Cook's lawyers wrote.",
      "Cook's attorneys, Abbe Lowell and Norm Eisen, said in a statement that the order \"rightly allows Governor Cook to continue in her role on the Federal Reserve Board, and we look forward to further proceedings consistent with the Court's order.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in response to the Supreme Court's move that \"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. We look forward to ultimate victory after presenting our oral arguments before the Supreme Court in January.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook from the Fed board in August and her subsequent lawsuit arguing the removal broke the law set up a major test of his authority to oust key officials at the central bank. The president has criticized the Fed for not lowering interest rates sooner and is seeking to put his stamp on the seven-member board.",
      "The Senate confirmed Stephen Miran, an adviser to Mr. Trump, to the board of governors last month. Miran chaired the White House's Council of Economic Advisers and is taking an unpaid leave of absence from that job while serving on the Fed board, an unusual move.",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts to oust Cook are unprecedented, as no president has attempted to remove a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history. Critics of the move have warned that the effort harms the Fed's independence and could destabilize markets.",
      "In announcing his decision to fire her, the president claimed Cook made misrepresentations on mortgage documents in 2021, before she was appointed to the board of governors, by claiming two different properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Atlanta as her principal residence in order to gain more favorable lending terms.",
      "Cook's lawyers have said she \"did not ever commit mortgage fraud,\" and she has not been charged with any wrongdoing. They called the allegations \"flimsy\" and \"unproven.\" Reuters reported\u00a0that a loan estimate for the property in Atlanta, dated May 28, 2021, showed that Cook declared that residence as a \"vacation home.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said the alleged misstatements gave him \"sufficient cause\" to remove Cook from the Fed board.",
      "\"That the Federal Reserve Board plays a uniquely important role in the American economy only heightens the government's and the public's interest in ensuring that an ethically compromised member does not continue wielding its vast powers,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a request for emergency relief to the Supreme Court.",
      "He continued: \"Put simply, the President may reasonably determine that interest rates paid by the American people should not be set by a Governor who appears to have lied about facts material to the interest rates she secured for herself \u2014 and refuses to explain the apparent misrepresentations.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled last month that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her removal. The judge said the president's reason for ousting Cook rests on alleged actions before she joined the Fed board, and found the requirement that Fed governors can only be removed \"for cause\" covers only conduct while in-office.",
      "Cook joined the Fed board in 2022 and was reappointed by President Biden to a 14-year-term that is set to end in 2038.",
      "Cobb also ruled that Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before her removal.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the district judge's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which voted 2-1 to decline its request to let Mr. Trump fire Cook.",
      "The two-judge majority agreed that Cook did not receive adequate process before her removal. It did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, the Trump administration said it is not challenging the constitutionality of the for-cause removal restriction for Fed governors enacted by Congress.",
      "But Cook's lawyers said there must be \"some meaningful check\" on the president's ability to remove her.",
      "\"Otherwise, any president could remove any governor based on any charge of wrongdoing, however flawed,\" they wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"That regime is not what Congress envisioned when it protected the Federal Reserve Board from presidential control. That regime is not what this Court envisioned when it went out of its way to single out the Board as a unique institution with a unique history of independence.\"",
      "Cook is one of several Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies that Mr. Trump has moved to fire since returning to the White House. The Supreme Court has so far allowed the president to oust members of the National Labor Relations Board, Merit Systems Protection Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission and Federal Trade Commission without cause.",
      "It will hear arguments in December on the constitutionality of removal protections for FTC commissioners and whether to overturn a key 1935 decision that allowed Congress to insulate certain independent agencies from political pressure. The case tests the scope of the president's removal authority.",
      "But the high court in May suggested the Fed is different from those agencies because it is a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",

      "This week, Spirit Airlines will end service to nearly a dozen cities. The bankrupt low-cost carrier is cutting staff, grounding planes and slashing its flight schedule as it searches for a route back to profitability.",
      "Spirit will drop service to 11 cities the week of Oct. 2 in the western and southern U.S. The cities where service is impacted include: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California.",

      "\"Spirit is the incredible shrinking airline right now and unless there are other low cost airlines that compete with Spirit on these routes, consumers should expect to pay more,\" Harteveldt said.",
      "Recently, United announced it would add 15 new routes hoping to capitalize on Spirits' cuts.",
      "\"I think there's always going to be robust competition particularly for price driven customers. Some airlines will fail. Some new ones will come up. It's not just about price, it's about the value and what you get for it,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said.",

    "story": [
      "The ADP National Employment Report, a measure of private employment in the U.S., said on Wednesday that payrolls at private employers declined by 32,000 jobs last month, signaling the labor market continued to face headwinds in September.",
      "More attention may be given to the ADP data this week because the government's monthly jobs report, scheduled for release on Friday, Oct. 3, could be delayed due to the government shutdown that began today, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which issues the federal monthly jobs report, noted in a statement that it has halted data releases \"due to the suspension of Federal government services.\" It added, \"The last update to the site was Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025. Updates to the site will start again when the Federal government resumes operations.\"",
      "The ADP report, which is based on payroll data from more than 26 million U.S. employees, comes as the U.S. economy expanded at a stronger-than-expected rate in the second quarter. At the same time, the government's monthly jobs reports this summer have shown disappointing job growth as some businesses are holding off on hiring amid economic challenges such as tariffs and artificial intelligence.",
      "\"This is the latest data point signaling a fairly dramatic softening in labor momentum as companies aggressively dial back on hiring,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said in a report.",
      "September's ADP decline represents the largest since March 2023, according to Capital Economics.",
      "The government jobs report, issued by the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, is expected to show that employers hired 50,000 people last month, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. Given the government shutdown, it's unclear whether the report will be issued Friday, or, if not, how long it might be delayed.",
      "The ADP report differs from the BLS monthly jobs report in that it only tracks employment at private businesses, while the government data covers both private employers and public sector hiring at local, state and federal levels. As a result, the two reports can differ significantly, and the ADP report doesn't always foreshadow the BLS' monthly data.",
      "\"Although there is only a passing correlation between monthly changes in the ADP measure of private payrolls and the official non-farm payrolls estimates, the plunge in the former in September is a concern, particularly since the government shutdown could delay the release of the official employment data,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, sad in a report Wednesday.",
      "The Federal Reserve is scheduled to make its next interest-rate decision on Oct. 29, with most economists forecasting a cut of 0.25 percentage points, according to CME FedWatch. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark rate by that amount at its meeting last month, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell citing weaker labor market conditions as a reason for the move to ease borrowing costs.",
      "\"If the shutdown drags on, the weakness in the ADP will be all the Fed has to go on as it considers another rate cut at the FOMC meeting late this month,\" Brown said.",
      "Most of the weakness last month was due to small and midsize businesses shedding jobs, while large employers \u2014 those with more than 500 workers \u2014 added 33,000 employees in September, ADP said.",

    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 11:17:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S.\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email.",

      "A government shutdown on Wednesday could have the potential to disrupt a multitude of federal activities \u2014 but people with student loans are expected to continue making their repayments, according to the U.S. Department of Education.",
      "People with student loans \"will still be required to make payments on their outstanding student debt,\" the Education Department said in a Sept. 28 contingency plan for an Oct. 1 federal shutdown.",
      "While loans are still due for repayment, it could be hard to reach someone at the Education Department if a problem arises, given that most of its employees are scheduled to be furloughed in the event of a shutdown, said Persis Yu, managing counsel at Protect Borrowers, an advocacy group for people with student loans.",
      "\"Student loan borrowers will still need to pay their bills during a shutdown,\" Yu told CBS News. \"However, if things go wrong with their servicer, which they often do, borrowers are going to have fewer people to turn to to get those errors resolved.\"",
      "There would also likely be little impact on federal aid, such as loans and grants, for students who are currently enrolled in colleges and university programs because most payments are disbursed at the start of the academic year, according to a statement from the American Council on Education, a higher-education advocacy group.",
      "Still, some borrowers and students in the applications stage could encounter hurdles during a shutdown, the group added.",
      "\"Borrowers seeking assistance from [the Education Department] may face delays, and loan forgiveness applications could be impacted if the shutdown persists,\" the American Council on Education said.",
      "The Education Department operates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which is aimed at helping public workers \u2014 such as teachers and police officers \u2014 discharge their federal student loans after they've served in government or not-for-profit organizations for more than 10 years.",
      "The DOE also runs income-driven repayment plans that provide forgiveness after 20 - 25 years of repayment.",
      "About 2,100 of the Education Department's roughly 2,400 employees are expected to be furloughed in the event of a government shutdown, according to the agency's contingency plan. Those include most of the agency's Office of Federal Student Aid, the plan shows.",
      "Could Pell Grants or the FAFSA be impacted?",
      "The Education Department said it would continue to disburse student aid such as Pell Grants and Federal Direct Student loans in the event of a shutdown because those programs are funded through mandatory spending or carryover appropriations, and therefore don't require approval from Congress.",
      "\"More than 9.9 million students receive student aid, in the form of grants and loans, at approximately 5,400 schools through these programs,\" the agency noted.",
      "The DOE said it plans to use permanent appropriations to continue processing student aid requests through the Free Applications for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, which opened on Sept. 24 for the 2026-27 academic year. The FAFSA is used by parents and students to apply for loans, grants and work-study funds to pay for college or career training programs.",
      "\"FAFSA applications actually opened early, with the form becoming fully available as of Sept. 24,\" rather than the traditional opening day of Oct. 1, NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood told CBS News. \"Students shouldn't expect delays or for deadlines to be pushed back. Unless the Education Department says otherwise, there's no reason to wait to file the FAFSA.\"",
      "Funding for Title I and IDEA grants, which are for low-income schools and disabled students, respectively, would also continue to be available, it added.",
      "Likewise, most GI Bill benefits for students who are veterans should also continue without disruption if the government shuts down because the program is funded by mandatory spending that doesn't need to be re-approved by Congress, according to the American Council on Education, which cited the Department of Veterans Affairs' contingency plan.",
      "\"However, some delays [for ex-military students] could arise if the shutdown is prolonged or if students require additional verification, corrections or appeals during the lapse,\" the ACE noted.",
      "It added, \"In previous shutdowns, VA has experienced backlogs in claims processing and a slowdown in support services due to furloughed staff and reduced system capacity.\"",
      "What Education Department activities would be impacted?",
      "New grants would be halted during a government shutdown, the Education Department noted. But since most grants are awarded over the summer, only a small number of recipients would likely be impacted, it added.",
      "\"Grantees will continue to be able to draw down funds from these awards and, therefore, the impacts on schools and students should be minimal,\" the agency said. \"The Office for Civil Rights would pause its review and investigations of civil rights complaints.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-artificial-intelligence-work-trade-jobs/",
    "published": "Wed, 01 Oct 2025 00:28:17 -0400",
    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/catastrophe-bonds-insurance/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 20:11:39 -0400",
    "summary": "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "In many communities at high risk for natural disasters, a Wall Street financing tool that's gaining popularity, called a catastrophe bond, may make it easier for homeowners to get insurance. On Oak Island, North Carolina, homeowners who face annual hurricane risk are seeing the impacts firsthand.",
      "The interest in catastrophe bonds comes as insured property losses increased from $30 billion in 2015 to over $110 billion in 2024, adjusted for inflation, the Insurance Information Institute found, while homeowner insurance premiums increased 40% faster than inflation between 2017 and 2022, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Many insurance companies have left high-risk markets altogether.",
      "Catastrophe bonds are contingent on whether or not a disaster takes place. Insurance companies sponsor bonds that are then purchased by investors, typically institutional investors. If a natural disaster does not take place, investors get a return on their investment. But if a disaster meeting certain thresholds takes place, money goes to insurance companies to pay out customers' claims, and investors lose money. Catastrophe bonds are beneficial to insurers because they make large amounts of capital available to pay insurance claims. The bonds are appealing to investors because disasters that lead to insurance payouts are rare.",
      "Catastrophe bonds cover a wide range of disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tornadoes and pandemics. But most catastrophe bonds have specific requirements on the degree of disaster before they are \"triggered\" to pay out to insurance companies. For instance, hurricanes may be required to reach a certain category of intensity, and floods may have to reach a certain height in order for investors to lose money. Many catastrophe bonds also require a certain amount of financial losses before they begin paying out.",
      "On Oak Island, a catastrophe bond sponsored by the North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association is helping fund insurance and hurricane resilience projects. One such project is for local resident Paige Morgan's home, installing a fortified roof meant to withstand hurricanes and other extreme weather.",
      "\"If you're not prepared for something like this, you're taking a huge risk,\" she told CBS News. \"I've seen families lose their whole house, everything in it, with these last few storms\".",
      "Using catastrophe bonds to fund weather resilience upgrades is a new model for the industry. Gina Hardy, CEO of NCIUA, added a provision to her company's bond so that when investors profit, some of their proceeds go toward funding weather resilience upgrades like those on Morgan's home.",
      "\"When you put on a fortified roof, it reduces your probability of loss by 62%, so the more fortified roofs that we can get on, the less claims that we have,\" she said.",
      "For NCIUA, catastrophe bonds have become an important part of making sure insurance is affordable to its clients. NCIUA is North Carolina's insurer of last resort and has sponsored catastrophe bonds since 2009. Their catastrophe bonds have never been triggered, but if there were ever a severe disaster, the funding would be vital.",
      "\"If you have a Katrina that happens to hit, or a Cat. Five that hits North Carolina, we need to have enough funding to be able to pay claims, and so we go out to worldwide markets to obtain that funding,\" Hardy told CBS News. \"Catastrophe bonds are a way to get investors to provide additional protection for the citizens of North Carolina.\"",
      "For catastrophe bond investors, choosing bonds and calculating risk for investing has become a science. In April, King Ridge Capital Advisors launched a catastrophe bond exchange-traded fund. The ETF is the first way for the public to invest in catastrophe bonds, which were previously only tradable by institutional investors.",
      "Vijay Manghnani, managing partner at King Ridge Capital Advisors, has a PhD in oceanography and meteorology, and uses his scientific background to help determine which catastrophe bonds fit in King Ridge Capital Advisors' portfolio.",
      "\"When we look at hurricane risk, we are actually studying hurricane risk for the last 150 years. We pull through the data, we build models that not only take all that into account, but actually look forward, we bring in climate change risk to it,\" he told CBS News.",
      "If the catastrophe bond triggers fit the firm's tolerance for risk, they invest.",
      "Catastrophe bonds have performed well in recent years. In 2024, the catastrophe bond market netted a 17% return, according to Swiss Re.",
      "For investors, the main benefit is that catastrophe bond returns are not correlated to the market, and therefore are unaffected by shocks to the economy. That theory was put to the test earlier this year when the White House levied tariffs.",
      "\"We launched our ETF on April 1, which was the day before the tariffs were rolled out, and for the month of April, we were one of the few securities that actually made profit,\" Manghnani said."

      "A possible U.S. government shutdown\u00a0on Wednesday could hinge on a deal to maintain a tax credit that helps 22 million Americans lower their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces.",
      "Known as the enhanced premium tax credit, the subsidy has been used by millions of low- and middle-class households since it was authorized under the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021. Since then, spurred by the tax credit, the number of people who have enrolled in ACA marketplace health insurance plans has almost doubled, according to health care publication KFF.",
      "But it is set to expire at the end of 2025, and leading Democratic lawmakers are making a funding deal to keep the government open contingent on Republicans agreeing to extend the credit.",
      "Even as the outcome of the funding negotiations in Washington, D.C., remains uncertain, expiration of the premium health care credits could inflict financial pain on millions of Americans, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers are already preparing to send notices to households that they will see increases starting in January 2026,\" said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal economic advocacy group, and former a White House economic official under former President Joe Biden, on a conference call Friday to discuss the tax credit.",
      "He added, \"People are more and more concerned about the cost of living, and [this is] a hit to their pocketbooks that they will start seeing in weeks.\"",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the enhanced ACA premium tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "How much could ACA premiums increase?",
      "The cost of premiums for people who buy their insurance through the ACA marketplaces could more than double, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a Sept. 30 analysis by KFF.\u00a0About 4 million people would likely drop their insurance coverage if the credit is allowed to expire because they would't be able to afford the costs, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "The premium tax credit is aimed at people who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, and who can't get affordable health care through an employer. The credit is available for those who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which means a family of four with annual income of up to $128,600 would qualify for the credit.",
      "With expiration of the ACA coverage credit only months away, some policy holders have already received noticed that their premiums \u2014 the monthly fee paid for insurance coverage \u2014 are poised to surge next year. Insurers have sent out notices in nearly every state, with some proposing premium increases of as much as 50%.",
      "Insurers are already planning on substantial premium hikes in 2026, according to a Peterson KFF Health System Tracker survey published last month. The poll found that 312 insurers participating in ACA marketplaces are proposing median increases of 18% next year, about 11 percentage points higher than in 2025.",
      "That increase would represent the largest rate hike since 2018, and is driven by higher costs for medical care as well as the expiration of the premium tax credits. Sharply higher ACA premiums would likely cause healthier people to drop coverage, making it more expensive to insure those who remain, the group said.",
      "The proposed hikes range from a high of 39.9%, from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Oklahoma, to a low of 4.6% for Oscar Garden State Insurance Corporation, their survey found.",
      "In Iowa last month, the state's insurance commissioner weighed increases ranging from 3% to 37%, arousing public concerns. One woman who runs a garden center in Cedar Falls, Iowa, said she was considering dropping health insurance altogether.",
      "\"I am already living as frugally as I possibly can while working as hard as I possibly can, putting in as many hours as I am allowed to at my job, never missing a day of work,\" one woman, LuAnn, wrote in a comment published on the commissioner's website.",
      "Signs of financial fragility",
      "The potential hike in insurance costs comes as many Americans continue struggling with the cost of living, said Rohit Chopra, former director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, on the conference call with Jacquez, organized by Groundwork, which supports extending the credits.",
      "\"Some people will need to drop their insurance all together, but households with someone with a chronic illness will have to pay those big, big increases,\" Chopra said. That would require some families to make tough financial choices, such as not paying other bills or accumulating debt to cover their expenses, he added.",
      "Although inflation around the U.S. has eased significantly since its post-pandemic peak in 2022, costs continue to inch higher. The Federal Reserve's 2% inflation target is slipping further from reach this year, with the Consumer Price Index climbing higher in recent months. Some consumers are showing signs of increasing financial stress, with credit card delinquencies on the rise and balances creeping higher.",
      "Meanwhile, many Americans aren't aware that the ACA enhanced premium tax credits will expire in a matter of months, KFF found in a survey.",
      "\"Consumers should not panic, but they do need to prepare,\" Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at insurance website Healthinsurance.org, said in an email.",
      "People should make sure to compare various plans available to them on the marketplaces and explore options such as Health Savings Plans, which allows people to set aside money to pay for medical expenses, she said.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 09:59:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Gregory's Coffee founder Gregory Zamfotis said. That might be easier said than done.",
    "story": [
      "The first Gregory's Coffee opened in 2006 on Manhattan's Park Avenue. Nineteen years later, the family-owned business has expanded to over 54 locations around the U.S. as well as a roastery in Queens, New York, that handles coffee beans from Brazil, Rwanda, Nicaragua and other major global producers.",
      "For Gregory Zamfotis, founder of the New York City-based chain, the business is about more than just dollars and cents \u2014 it's also about recognizing the special place coffee has long had in American culture as a driver of social connections.",
      "\"Coffee is built into the fabric of our society,\" Zamfotis told CBS News. \"People come together over coffee. When it's a meeting or interview, or we just want to get some work done, coffee tends to be the centerpiece of those conversations.\"",
      "With many Americans still feeling the effects of elevated inflation, for many coffee drinkers, one of those conversations is likely to center on the drink's soaring costs.",
      "Prices have leaped nearly 21% over the past 12 months, with the average retail price of 100% ground roast coffee recently reaching a record high of $8.87 per pound, up from $7.02 in January, USDA data shows.",
      "Several factors are behind the spike in coffee prices, including droughts in Brazil and volatile weather in other regions where the bean is cultivated. More recently, heavy U.S. tariffs on coffee-producing countries \u2014 including a hefty 50% levy on Brazil \u2014 have also driven up prices.",
      "Though coffee is a staple of American daily life, the vast majority of the beans is imported. Much of that is sourced from Latin America, with Brazil alone accounting for 35%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. produces relatively little coffee compared to the rest of the world. Hawaii, the top-producing state, harvested 21 million pounds during the 2024\u201325 season, according to the USDA. Yet Americans consumed a whopping 3.3 billion pounds of coffee during the same period, the agency said.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up\"",
      "Jake Leonti, director of coffee at Gregory's Coffee, said it's also far pricier to grow and produce coffee in the U.S.",
      "\"It's exponentially [more] expensive because it's Americans farming,\" he said. \"Whereas we can get super high-quality coffee from different parts of the world at a price that's much more friendly to the consumer.\"",
      "Gregory's Coffee has not raised prices yet despite the jump in costs. But Leonti said that could change soon.",
      "\"Prices are going to have to go up \u2014 there's no other way around it,\" he said. \"We're seeing tariffs from the places where we get our bags printed as well. So everything around the coffee business is getting tariffs at some point.\"",
      "Like other retailers, Gregory's prices vary depending on where a store is located, reflecting regional labor and other costs. In New York City, the chain charges $3.45 for a regular cup of coffee, while at its New Jersey and Washington, D.C., outlets the same item runs $3.15.",
      "Other retailers are also preparing for increased coffee costs. Mark Smucker, CEO of The J.M. Smucker Co., whose portfolio includes the Folgers Coffee, Caf\u00e9 Bustelo and Dunkin' at-home brands, said during the company's fourth-quarter earnings call in June that prices will likely increase for a third time this year \"due to higher green coffee costs.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Catherine R. Smith said during the company's third-quarter earnings call in July that, due to the company's coffee buying and hedging practices, customers shouldn't expect price increases until the first half of fiscal 2026.",
      "At Gregory's Coffee, \"The last thing we want to do is just keep raising prices on our guests,\" Zamfotis said. \"We're hoping that if prices go up a few pennies across the board, that doesn't turn off our everyday customers. We're not doing this to make more money \u2014 we're doing this to protect our business.\"",

    "summary": "Newspapers announced John D. Rockefeller as the first U.S. billionaire 109 years ago. Today there are more than 900 American billionaires.",
    "story": [
      "On Sept. 29, 1916, it was front page news that a surge in Standard Oil's stock price likely made oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller America's first billionaire.",
      "More than a century later, the United States is home to hundreds of billionaires whose fortunes increasingly come from technology and financial markets. Together, they control a growing share of the country's wealth \u2014 approaching the percentage held by Gilded Age industrialists who built monopolies in railroads, oil and steel.",
      "Here's what research tells us about America's billionaire class today.",
      "American billionaires number over 900, according to researchers",
      "There are a few different estimates of the number of American billionaires, but researchers tend to agree that the billionaire class exceeds 900 and is growing.",
      "Forbes, which has produced a list of billionaires since the 1980s, counted roughly 900 in early 2025 \u2014 up from 813 in 2024.",
      "Meanwhile, the wealth-data firm Altrata pinned the number of U.S. billionaires at 1,135 in 2024, an uptick from 1,050 in 2023 and up more than 80% from levels in 2016, when they began releasing yearly reports.",
      "And JP Morgan Chase Private Bank estimated the number at roughly 1,990 in 2024 \u2014 about 15% more than its 2023 estimate.",
      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court convenes for a new term Monday and is set to hear cases ranging from the use of race in redistricting to Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Monday for the start of its new term, with cases involving \"conversion therapy\" for minors, the use of race in redistricting, gun rights and state laws barring the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports on the docket.",
      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "The Supreme Court has in a string of recent decisions unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly and now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will decide whether Hawaii can bar people with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns on private property that is open to the public unless they receive permission from the property owner.",
      "The high court said it will review a decision by a federal appeals court that upheld Hawaii's firearms restriction. In agreeing to take up the dispute, it adds gun rights to a term already loaded with hot-button issues, including race-based redistricting, state laws targeting transgender athletes and campaign finance, as well as several cases involving President Trump.",
      "The legal battle is the latest involving gun regulations to arrive at the Supreme Court since it expanded Second Amendment rights in 2022 with a decision that set a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms restrictions. This case appears to be the first that the Supreme Court will hear since its ruling that involves the places where guns can be carried.",
      "Since that 2022 decision, the high court has declined to take up challenges to state assault-weapons bans, as well as others involving longstanding federal laws restricting who can have guns. Last year, however, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that prohibits people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having firearms.",
      "The legal battle now before the high court arose after Hawaii passed legislation in 2023 that responded to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in the case known as New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. The measure prohibits a person with a concealed carry permit from bringing a handgun onto different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",

      "\"Nothing in the text of the Second Amendment or otherwise suggests that a private property owner \u2014 even owners who open their private property to the public \u2014 must allow persons who bear arms to enter,\" a 9th Circuit panel of judges found.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia had asked an immigration judge to reopen his deportation proceedings.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 An immigration judge in Maryland declined to reopen the immigration case involving Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported to his home country earlier this year and then brought back to the U.S. to face criminal charges, according to court filings.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers had asked an immigration judge in August to reopen the proceedings and allow him to seek asylum in the United States. While the bid was denied, Abrego Garcia can appeal the decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "In a court filing in one of Abrego Garcia's cases in Maryland, his lawyers said that immigration judge Philip Taylor determined that there is \"insufficient evidence that the Department of Homeland Security 'has presented [Abrego Garcia] with a formal notice of removal or any other document showing its intent to remove him to Uganda, Eswatini, or any other third country.'\"",
      "Taylor wrote in a separate decision that there is \"insufficient evidence\" to demonstrate that Abrego Garcia's removal to Uganda, El Salvador or another country is \"imminent.\"",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said Abrego Garcia's final order of removal stands.",
      "\"His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country. He will never be allowed to prey on innocent Americans again,\" the department said in a post to social media.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into federal immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But he remained detained for several weeks because of concerns that Abrego Garcia would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "Abrego Garcia left criminal confinement in late August, but was arrested by immigration authorities days later when he went for an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. He filed a petition challenging the legality of his arrest and detention, and a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia applied for asylum in 2019, but an immigration judge said he waited too long to do so and denied the bid. Under federal immigration law, an asylum-seeker has to file an application within one year of their arrival to the U.S. The immigration judge said in the 2019 decision that Abrego Garcia waited seven years to file a request for asylum.",
      "But the judge, David Jones, said Abrego Garica provided \"credible responses\" to questions and provided \"substantial documentation\" bolstering his claim for asylum, including affidavits from family members describing threats by a local gang.",

    "summary": "Community health centers are key to delivering care in underserved communities around the country, but their services could be disrupted or scaled back after governments did not renew their funding.",
    "story": [
      "About 1,500 federally funded health centers that serve millions of low-income people face significant financial challenges, their leaders say, as the government shutdown compounds other cuts to their revenue.",
      "Some of these community health centers may have to cut medical and administrative staff or reduce services. Some could eventually close. The result, their advocates warn, may be added pressure on already crowded hospital emergency rooms.",
      "\"This is the worst time in all the years I have been working in health care,\" said Jim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John's Community Health, a network of 28 clinics that serves more than 144,000 patients in Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Bernardino counties in California. \"We are facing federal cuts and extreme state cuts that will impact services.\"",
      "St. John's and other federally qualified health centers offer primary care and a wide range of other services free of charge or on a sliding fee scale. Nationwide, they see nearly 34 million patients in the country's most underserved areas.",
      "The federal funds come through two primary routes, both of which face challenges: grants paid in part through the federal Community Health Center Fund and reimbursements for patients' care through programs like Medicaid, which provides health insurance for low-income people and people with disabilities. Medicaid is jointly funded by states and the federal government.",
      "Congress has approved the grant money in dribs and drabs recently. In March, lawmakers extended the funds until Sept. 30. That money expired after the Republican-controlled Congress did not pass a funding law, leading to a government shutdown.",
      "Advocates say the health centers need long-term funding to help them plan with more certainty, ideally through a multiyear fund.",
      "The centers received $4.4 billion in grants in early 2024. The National Association of Community Health Centers is advocating for at least $5.8 billion in grants annually for two years to keep the centers fully functional.",
      "The health center safety net faces \"multiple layers of challenges,\" said Vacheria Keys, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs for the association.",
      "The new spending law that Republicans call the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" will significantly cut Medicaid, raising the second set of threats for health centers.",
      "Medicaid accounted for 43% of the $46.7 billion in health center revenue in 2023.",
      "Advocates said lower Medicaid payments will exacerbate a gap between funding and operational costs.",
      "Funding for workforce programs also is needed to support the delivery of health care services as centers struggle to hire and retain workers, said Feygele Jacobs, director of the Geiger Gibson Program in Community Health at George Washington University.",
      "The first clinics of this type opened in places such as Massachusetts in the 1960s. Congress typically has funded them with bipartisan support, with minor fluctuations.",
      "The struggle this year began when the Trump administration froze domestic aid through a January memo, which prevented some centers from receiving already approved grant money. As a consequence, some health centers in states such as Virginia closed or merged operations.",
      "The upcoming cuts also are set to arrive at a time when patients will face new demands and challenges. The Medicaid changes in President Trump's tax-and-spending law include requirements for Medicaid enrollees to report their work or other service hours to keep their benefits.",
      "Meanwhile, more generous tax credits the Biden administration and Congress provided consumers to help pay for Affordable Care Act health insurance are set to expire at the end of the year. Some consumers' costs will spike if Congress doesn't renew them.",
      "One reason the government shut down is that Democrats want to extend the tax credits, which protect consumers from higher insurance costs. The Republican funding bill did not include an extension; Republican congressional leaders say the issue should be addressed separately.",
      "Consumers \"will need more support than ever,\" said Jacobs, noting that Medicaid cuts and the expiration of the higher tax credits will both \"potentially throw people out of coverage.\"",
      "Ninety percent of the centers' patients have incomes that are twice the federal poverty level or less, and 40% are Hispanic.",
      "\"We are also receiving 300 calls per day from patients concerned about their coverage,\" said Mangia, from St. John's.",
      "Republicans are not directly targeting the centers, although they supported the Medicaid cuts that will affect the clinics' finances. Many Republicans say Medicaid spending has ballooned and that reducing the program's growth will make it more sustainable.",
      "State and local support",
      "While advocating for longer-term federal funding, the centers also are looking to their community and local governments for backing.",
      "Some states already took action while finalizing their annual budgets. Connecticut, Minnesota, Illinois, and Massachusetts allocated money for centers. Maryland, Oregon, and Wisconsin also provided support for the health centers.",
      "The question is how long the money will last.",
      "While some states boosted their support of the centers, others are going in the opposite direction. Anticipating the impact of Medicaid cuts, states such as California made their own cuts to the program.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom's office, the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and the federal Health Resources and Services Administration did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "In Los Angeles, Mangia said, one potential solution is to work with partners at the county level, noting that L.A. County has about 10 million residents.",
      "\"We can tax ourselves to increase funding for health care services,\" he said.",
      "Health center leaders are building a coalition that \"hopefully\" will include the main stakeholders in the county's health care system \u2014 community health centers, clinics, hospitals, doctors, health plans, unions \u2014 to begin the process to fill out a ballot petition, Mangia said. The goal: Put the question about taxes for health centers on the ballot and let voters decide.",

      "According to a White House official, a letter outlining the plan and a copy of the agreement were sent on Wednesday to the University of Arizona, Brown University, Dartmouth College, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, University of Southern California, University of Texas, University of Virginia and Vanderbilt University.",
      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",
      "A copy of the letter sent to universities obtained by CBS News notes that schools that agree to the compact will receive \"allowance for increased overhead payments where feasible, substantial and meaningful federal grants, and other federal partnerships.\"",
      "The letter is signed by Mailman; Secretary of Education Linda McMahon; and Vince Haley, director of the White House's Domestic Policy Council. It asks for written comments from the universities by \"no later than October 20.\"",
      "\"After receiving feedback, schools that show clear alignment and a strong readiness to champion this effort will be invited to the White House to finalize language and be initial signatories,\" the letter says. \"We are aiming to have a signed agreement by no later than November 21, 2025.\"",
      "The Department of Education did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Prioritizing U.S. students",
      "A University of Virginia spokesperson said its interim president, Paul G. Mahoney, has created a working group to advise him on how to respond to the letter. \"The University has not yet made any decision regarding the compact,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The University of Southern California said it is reviewing the letter. In a statement to CBS News, Vanderbilt said that \"We look forward to carefully reviewing the compact and providing meaningful feedback to the administration.\" MIT acknowledged receiving the material but declined further comment.",
      "The other universities did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus. Last month, a federal judge ruled that the Harvard funding freeze was illegal.",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News that warns of attacks on ICE by \"domestic violent extremists.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Department of Homeland Security and FBI have issued a joint intelligence bulletin obtained by CBS News that warns of attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) personnel and facilities, including by \"domestic violent extremists\" claiming to respond to immigration enforcement activities.",
      "The memo \u2014 circulated to state and local law enforcement nationwide on Wednesday \u2014 assesses that since June, extremists in at least three states have conducted targeted, pre-planned violent attacks against ICE personnel and facilities. It says the attacks represent \"an evolution in tactics and an escalation in violence compared to [domestic violent extremists'] past attacks, which primarily resulted in property damage.\"",
      "The Trump administration has warned of a surge in threats against ICE agents and facilities in recent months, as immigration arrests and deportations rise. The administration has floated sending personnel from other agencies to guard ICE facilities, and has weighed military deployments to Chicago and Portland, Oregon \u2014 drawing stiff opposition from local officials.",
      "Wednesday's memo points to an attack last week in which a gunman identified as 29-year-old Joshua Jahn fired from the roof of a building into three ICE transport vehicles and windows of a Dallas ICE facility. The attack wounded three detainees, one of whom died at the scene and another of whom succumbed to his injuries six days later.",
      "According to the bulletin, the gunman \"conducted prior surveillance of the ICE facility, enabling him to identify areas where ICE personnel likely would be located.\" Authorities say Jahn died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.",
      "The bulletin also references a Fourth of July attack on the ICE Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas, that saw one alleged domestic violent extremist open fire on a local law enforcement officer from a concealed position. The attack occurred around 11 p.m. on the holiday, outside the sprawling ICE detention facility, which houses between 1,000 and 2,000 immigration detainees.",
      "The bulletin says investigators have found the group of people allegedly responsible for the shooting used an identified encrypted communication platform and a local residence to conduct pre-operational planning. \"As of September 2025, the FBI has arrested 20 individuals involved in the Prairieland Detention Center attack, including the alleged gunman and individuals who helped the gunman evade law enforcement after the attack,\" the memo noted.",
      "The bulletin also cites \"additional unplanned, reactive violent attacks that took advantage of First Amendment-protected activity.\"",
      "\"Since at least June 2025, small groups of threat actors, some of whom are [domestic violent extremists], have leveraged large, lawful protests in the Los Angeles, California area and in multiple cities in Oregon to engage in violent activity targeting ICE property,\" the report indicated. \"These individuals have caused damage to ICE facilities in Portland and Eugene, Oregon, and engaged in violent confrontations with law enforcement.\"",
      "The bulletin advised state and local law enforcement to \"remain vigilant to detect, prevent, or respond to [domestic violent extremist] incidents targeting ICE personnel or facilities in the United States.\"",
      "The FBI and DHS define a domestic violent extremist as \"an individual based and operating primarily within the United States or its own territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence.\"",
      "But the federal law enforcement agencies also say the \"mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics does not constitute extremism and may be constitutionally protected.\"",
      "ICE says law enforcement officials within the agency have faced a 1,000% increase in assaults against them since the beginning of the Trump administration, as President Trump looks to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests.",
      "The administration has vowed to crack down on threats against ICE, with Attorney General Pam Bondi directing personnel from the FBI and other Justice Department law enforcement agencies to assist with guarding immigration facilities earlier this week. Mr. Trump has said he will send military personnel to Portland, Oregon, to guard federal facilities, and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Monday he learned of a similar planned military deployment in his state. State officials decried the plans, with Pritzker accusing Mr. Trump of \"sowing fear and intimidation and division among Americans.\" Oregon is challenging the planned deployment in court.",
      "And last week, Mr. Trump directed law enforcement agencies to investigate \"domestic terrorism and organized political violence.\" Bondi directed regional Joint Terrorism Task Forces to look into \"repeated acts of violence and obstruction against federal agents.\"",
      "The president has blamed some of the threats against ICE on antifa, which he labeled a domestic terrorist organization. Legal experts say that move could face legal impediments since antifa is generally regarded as a loose affiliation of left-wing activists, not a centralized organization, and domestic terrorism isn't a chargeable offense under federal law.",
      "Both the FBI and DHS acknowledge that \"as immigration enforcement operations continue, DHS and the FBI remain concerned there is an increased risk of [domestic violent extremists] and criminal actors conducting targeted attacks on ICE personnel, facilities, or operations, or law enforcement officials supporting immigration enforcement operations.\" It notes that extremists will likely \"continue to view ICE enforcement operations as opportune targets for violence in furtherance of their political and social goals.\"",
      "\"Due to the highly personal nature of radicalization and mobilization to violence, it can be challenging to identify specific indicators of US violent extremists' intent to commit violence,\" the memo concedes.",

    "summary": "Recent polling shows a majority of Hispanics disapprove of the way President Trump is handling his job as president, but it hasn't translated into support for Democrats.",
    "story": [
      "The government shutdown that began Wednesday prompted the White House to cancel a celebration in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month with Latino supporters, a key voting group for President Trump in 2024. Despite periodic events showcasing GOP efforts to woo Hispanics, that support may be eroding.",
      "Latinos made up a big part of the coalition that helped propel Mr. Trump to victory \u2014 he won with nearly half of Latino voters \u2014 a historic high of 48% for a Republican presidential contender. A majority of Hispanic male voters backed him in the race against former Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "But recent polling suggests Hispanic support for the president and his policies has dropped, primarily over economic issues, including the high prices of groceries and housing.",
      "In a New York Times/Sienna poll this week, 69% of Hispanics said they disapprove of the way Mr. Trump is handling his job as president, and 58% said they believe he has made the economy worse since he took office.",
      "Polling of Latino voters that was used to brief national Democratic officials during the Democratic National Committee's summer meeting in Minnesota in August contained similar sentiments. The surveys, which were conducted by BSP Research in November, April and June, indicated Mr. Trump's approval was heavily net negative, and by June had become slightly more so, compared to April, after his first 100 days in office.",
      "According to that polling, more Latinos said immigration reform was important to them in June, compared to November 2024, around the presidential election. Then, they ranked it as their sixth-most important issue, but in June, immigration reform was their second-most important, trailing only their concern about the cost of living and inflation. Since President Trump took office, his administration has cracked down on immigrants it says are here illegally, and recently, the Department of Homeland Security said it was on pace to deport 600,000 undocumented immigrants by the end of the year.",
      "By June, the vast majority of the respondents said they were closely following the Trump administration's immigration actions, and almost half reported that they feared being deported, and they feared family members or friends could also be deported.",
      "Latino voters have been consistent about their top issue, the economy, Democratic officials learned. It was their top issue in November and that was still the case in June. At that time, they viewed the economy as bad and worried it was getting worse. Just under a fifth of Latino Trump voters said it was possible or likely that he and Republicans would lose their support.",
      "\"Latinos trusted him, believed him when they gave him their votes in 2024 when he promised that he was going to bring down the cost of groceries, gas and rent,\" said Democratic strategist\u00a0 Maria Cardona.",
      "But the polling presented to Democrats also found that Latinos' fears about Mr. Trump's economy did not seem to be translating into support for Democrats \u2014 by April, they still had not made major gains among these voters.",
      "\"Democrats need to talk about what they will do for Latinos, not just how horrendous Donald Trump and Republicans have been,\" Cardona said. \"Democrats need to lead with 'this is what we will do for you, here is how we will help you and your family live a better life,' which is again the reason why we all came to this country to begin with.\"",
      "Democrats and Republicans will have an opportunity to test their support in November's off-year elections in New Jersey and Virginia. In 2026, Republicans are counting on a high Latino voter turnout as they fight to hold on to the House majority next year.",
      "\"The Hispanic sentiment on the ground is we haven't seen the lower cost of energy, or food prices fast enough,\" said Jorge Martinez, strategic director of Libre, a national grassroots organization that mobilizes Latino voters.",
      "Martinez says it's too soon, however, to see the impact of economic policies under the One Big Beautiful Act that Republicans are rebranding as the \"Working Families Tax Cut\" law ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\"If Republicans can stay focused on creating progress, growth policies that bring more energy and lower cost of goods and services, I can see things getting better for Republicans, but they have to deliver on those results,\" said Martinez.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has determined the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels it has designated as terrorist organizations, it said in a notification to Congress viewed by CBS News.",
      "The administration delivered the notification after a mid-September strike on an alleged drug boat hailing from Venezuela. It was the second of three publicly disclosed U.S. attacks on boats in the southern Caribbean Sea last month.",
      "The notice calls the three individuals killed by the Sept. 15 strike \"unlawful combatants,\" which is the same term President George W. Bush's administration used to describe Al Qaeda and other terrorist networks. After the terrorist attacks on the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001, Congress authorized the use of military force against terrorist organizations responsible.",
      "Congress has not authorized the use of military force to target drug cartels.",
      "The New York Times first reported on the notification to Congress.",
      "A White House official said the information was part of a report to Congress required by the National Defense Authorization Act after the U.S. military conducts an attack. The specific notification concerned the strike on Sept. 15 against an alleged cartel boat. The report \"does not convey new information,\" the official said.",
      "The Trump administration has designated several drug cartels and gangs as terrorist organizations, including Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and El Salvador's MS-13. In the notification to Congress after the Sept. 15 strike, the White House said the drugs smuggled by these cartels kill tens of thousands of Americans each year and constitute an \"armed attack\" against U.S. citizens. It did not name any specific gangs or cartels.",
      "\"Although this strike was limited in scope, U.S. forces remain postured to carry out military operations as necessary to prevent further deaths or injury to American citizens by eliminating the threat posed by these designated terrorist organizations,\" the notice read.",
      "This notification uses language like \"armed conflict\" not seen in a previous letter to Congress from the White House that justified the Sept. 2 strike. That notice, which was signed by President Trump and obtained by CBS News last month, was submitted to Congress under a separate requirement.",
      "Asked about the notice, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said: \"As we have said many times, the President acted in line with the law of armed conflict to protect our country from those trying to bring deadly poison to our shores, and he is delivering on his promise to take on the cartels and eliminate these national security threats from murdering more Americans.\"",
      "Brian Finucane, a former attorney-adviser at the State Department who advised the U.S. government on counterterrorism and the use of military force, said the explanation given to Congress is not enough to justify the administration's actions.",
      "\"This justification put out here that the U.S. is somehow in an armed conflict does not do the trick because it's not supported by the facts,\" Finucune said in an interview. \"There has been no armed attack on the United States.\"",
      "Some members of Congress have also questioned the legal justification for the three boat strikes. The administration has said little about who was in each boat or what drugs were on board. Mr. Trump has alleged the first two boats \u2014 including the one hit on Sept. 15 \u2014 hailed from Venezuela, but didn't specify a country of origin for the third strike.",
      "The initial strike on Sept. 2, killed 11 people, according to a post on President Trump's Truth Social, which didn't include details about what drugs were on board.",
      "When asked what legal authority the Pentagon used to justify the strike, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters traveling with him to Fort Benning, Georgia, \"We have the absolute and complete authority to conduct that,\" without citing any specific legal justification.",
      "\"If foreign terrorist organizations are poisoning people with drugs from drug cartels, it is no different from Al Qaeda, and they'll be treated as such.\" Hegseth said.",
      "Since then, the U.S. military has struck two more alleged drug boats, one on Sept. 15, killing three people, and another on Sept. 19, killing another three, and has threatened further strikes.",
      "After the initial strike, Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky had an online dispute with Vice President J.D. Vance about the actions \u2014 and the lack of information from the administration.",
      "\"I'm just disappointed that, you know, the leaders of a country like ours that is famous for having due process for trying to make sure that the innocent aren't harmed in any way would glorify the idea of killing people without any sort of evidence presented as to who they are,\" he told reporters on Capitol Hill.",
      "The strikes come amid growing tensions between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, whom the U.S. has accused of collaborating with gangs \u2014 a charge Maduro's regime denies.",
      "Maduro said earlier this week he is considering declaring a state of emergency in response to U.S. \"aggression,\" following the boat strikes and a deployment of several U.S. Navy vessels off the waters of Venezuela.",
      "Separately in March, the White House invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, accusing its members of engaging in \"irregular warfare\" against the U.S. \"both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.\" The administration has controversially tried to use the law as a rationale to rapidly deport accused Tren de Aragua members, in some cases sending them to a Salvadoran prison.",

      "Federal officials have approved another generic version of the abortion pill mifepristone, a regulatory formality that quickly triggered pushback from anti-abortion groups and politicians aligned with the Trump administration.",
      "Drugmaker Evita Solutions announced on its website that the Food and Drug Administration signed off on its low-cost form of the pill, which is approved to end pregnancies through 10 weeks. Evita Solutions is the second company to have an approved generic version of mifepristone. The first was from pharmaceutical company GenBioPro, approved in 2019.",
      "The move prompted backlash from some conservatives.",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri criticized the move in a post on X, stating: \"I have lost confidence in the leadership at FDA.\"",
      "\"Anyone who tries to say their hands are tied has not been paying attention,\" Students for Life of America and Students for Life Action President Kristan Hawkins told CBS News. \"These drugs are dangerous, and this is a stain on the entire administration.\"",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said in a statement Thursday, \"This reckless decision by the F.D.A. to expand the availability of abortion drugs is unconscionable.\"",
      "The criticism comes as President Trump's top health officials, including Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., face growing pressure from abortion opponents to reevaluate mifepristone, which was approved 25 years ago and has repeatedly been deemed safe and effective by FDA scientists.",
      "In a statement, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon told CBS News that the agency \"has very limited discretion in deciding whether to approve a generic drug\" and that \"by law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services must approve an application if it demonstrates that the generic drug is identical to the brand-name drug.\"",
      "In a letter to Republican attorneys general last month, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary pledged to conduct a full review of the drug's safety.",
      "In their letter, Kennedy and Makary wrote, \"HHS \u2014 through the FDA \u2014 is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.\"",
      "CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder said last month that the FDA is unlikely to withdraw approval, a rare move that would likely trigger lawsuits, but depending on the safety review, it could restrict access by limiting telehealth or mail delivery, or by narrowing who can prescribe the drug.",
      "On the campaign trail last year, Mr. Trump told CBS News' Caitlin Huey-Burns that he would not prevent access to mifepristone.",
      "In 2021, the FDA under Democratic President Joe Biden permitted online prescribing and mail-order delivery of the drug, greatly expanding access. Abortion opponents have been fighting the change ever since.",
      "Approval of generic drugs is typically a rote process at the FDA, with multiple copycat versions usually approved after the patent on the original drug expires. In most cases, generic drugmakers only need to show that their drug matches the ingredients and formula developed by the original drugmaker.",
      "The FDA typically approves such applications within 10 months. But filing documents posted to the FDA's website show that Evita Solutions filed its application to market mifepristone four years ago.",
      "The company did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' requests for comment.",
      "On its website, Evita states that it \"believes that all people should have access to safe, affordable, high-quality, effective, and compassionate abortion care.\"",
      "Approval of a second generic is unlikely to affect access to the pill, which is typically taken with another drug, misoprostol. The\u00a0majority\u00a0of women who terminate pregnancies do so through medication abortions. Mifepristone dilates the cervix and blocks the hormone progesterone, while misoprostol causes the uterus to cramp and contract.",
      "\"This is exactly how our system is supposed to work, and it has worked this way for decades,\" Mini Timmaraju, president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, said in a statement. \"The only reason this routine approval is making headlines is because anti-abortion politicians have turned health care into a political battlefield.\"",
      "Access to mifepristone is restricted across large sections of the country because of state laws that ban abortion \u2014 including medication abortion \u2014 or impose separate restrictions on the drug's use. Those laws are subject to a number of ongoing lawsuits that are winding their way through the legal system.",

      "When asking them to compare longer-term job market trends they're seeing, the picture is mixed, and the jobs market is not seen as growing. By 4 to 1, Americans think there are fewer \u2014 not more \u2014 good jobs where they live than there were five years ago, and the rest see it holding steady. Even workers who feel they have some job security tend to think there are fewer, not more, good jobs out there.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-dc-immigration-arrests/",
    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 17:19:59 -0400",
    "summary": "Since launching its crackdown in Washington, D.C., the Trump administration has recorded over 3,500 arrests in the district, with nearly 1,400 strictly immigration-related.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 While President Trump billed the federal law enforcement surge in the nation's capital as an effort to crack down on violent crime, internal government data obtained by CBS News shows nearly 40% of over 3,500 arrests made since the operation began in early August were strictly immigration-related.",
      "The federal government statistics indicate that, as of Sept. 29, federal and local law enforcement officials assigned to the Trump administration's high-profile operation in Washington, D.C., had reported making just over 3,550 arrests.",
      "Nearly 1,400 of those arrests were counted as administrative arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, the federal agency spearheading Mr. Trump's mass deportation campaign. Those arrests involve immigrants ICE seeks to deport because of alleged civil violations of federal immigration law, like entering the U.S. illegally or overstaying a visa. It's unclear how many of those arrested by ICE had criminal histories in addition to their alleged civil immigration violations.",
      "The rest of the arrests, the data indicates, had a criminal nexus. The roughly 8-week-long operation has led to the arrest of 13 homicide suspects, nearly 500 narcotics arrests and about 300 firearms-related arrests. More than two dozen of the arrests involved individuals charged with sex-related crimes.",
      "Agents and officers deployed throughout the capital have also seized over 300 illegal guns and issued roughly 650 misdemeanor citations, plus more than 300 traffic citations, according to the data.",
      "The federal figures also suggest ICE agents have visited over 130 work sites in Washington. Those visits can be precursors to investigations into whether individuals are working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Thursday, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the \"focus of President Trump's highly successful DC operation has been to address crime committed by anyone, regardless of immigration status.\"",
      "\"Many of the illegal aliens arrested during this operation were committing crimes or had outstanding warrants and prior convictions for crimes like assault, DUIs, kidnapping, drug possession, and worse including an illegal alien who had a prior arrest for raping a child,\" Abigail Jackson added.",
      "A CBS News analysis of the first three weeks of the president's D.C. deployment showed that violent crime dropped by almost half when compared to the same 19 days in 2024.",
      "Although Mr. Trump's emergency order requiring local D.C. police to assist federal officials has expired, immigration and other federal agents continue to operate in the district. The Metropolitan Police Department has also kept a policy change from August that allows local police officers to share information with the federal immigration officials about individuals who are not in their custody. It also lets police officers transport federal immigration agents and detainees in their custody.",
      "As of Sept. 29, roughly 3,000 personnel from nearly two dozen federal and local agencies were deployed in Washington, including more than 1,300 National Guard troops and 250 agents from the Department of Homeland Security, the federal figures show. That includes nearly 200 personnel from Homeland Security Investigations and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations. More than 130 FBI agents and at least nine prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office in D.C. were deployed as part of the effort.",
      "When the city-wide \"crime emergency\" declared by Mr. Trump ended on Sept. 10, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced to reporters at a news conference that \"immigration enforcement is not what MPD does, and with the end of the emergency, it won't be what MPD does in the future.\"",
      "Asked for clarification on cooperation between D.C. police and immigration authorities on Tuesday, Bowser said, \"I am aware of what's been happening on the ground and ICE is not patrolling with MPD.\"",
      "A surge in Memphis",
      "A similar law enforcement surge is now underway in Memphis, Tennessee, where 650 personnel from 19 federal and state agencies are patrolling the streets. So far, multi-agency teams have made 93 arrests \u2014 including 69 criminal arrests for illegal firearms, drugs and sex offenses, according to U.S. government data analyzed by CBS News. But the task force has also conducted 24 civil immigration arrests.",
      "The deployment includes more than 100 agents dispatched by agencies within the Department of Homeland Security, including officials from HSI, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Federal Protective Services.",
      "Earlier this month, while flanked by Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Mr. Trump signed an order standing up a federal task force to send to Memphis, an effort he described as a \"replica\" of federal law enforcement efforts in D.C. According to a CBS News data team analysis, violent crime in Memphis is down 32% so far this year, compared to the same time period in 2024.",
      "Tennessee law requires local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement, including ICE, banning sanctuary policies statewide. Recent legislation mandates state and local police officers notify federal authorities if they encounter someone in the U.S. unlawfully. More than 20 agencies statewide now participate in what's known as ICE's 287(g) program, which is designed to deputize local officers to perform certain immigration enforcement functions and expand the federal government's immigration detention capacity.",
      "In Memphis, local leaders have said their focus is crime control, not acting as immigration agents, but state law leaves little room for discretion. Earlier this month, Mayor Paul Young acknowledged community concerns about the increased federal law enforcement, but vowed to use federal resources \"effectively and for the benefit of the residents of our great city.\"",
      "Lee Harris, the mayor of Shelby County, which includes Memphis, told CBS News he plans to declare an emergency to cover rising jail costs. The Trump administration's new mandate in Memphis has sparked concern from civil rights groups like the ACLU, who warn the crackdown risks sweeping up immigrants from traffic stops and other routine interactions with police, heightening fear for thousands of residents.",
      "What comes next",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry has asked for as many as 1,000 National Guardsmen to deploy to his state. In a letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday, the Republican leader requested troops to help \"supplement law enforcement presence in high-crime areas, provide logistical and communication support and secure critical infrastructure.\"",
      "Landry noted that cities like New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport have higher crime rates, a challenge compounded by a lack of law enforcement personnel.",
      "During a gathering of military leaders earlier this week, Mr. Trump suggested additional cities that he deemed \"unsafe,\" including Chicago, could see similar deployments of National Guard and military units.",
      "In the Chicago area, immigration officials have carried out over 900 arrests as part of an effort, dubbed Operation Midway Blitz, that started in early September, though the National Guard has not been involved so far. In Portland, federal officials have been dispatched to fortify an ICE facility after weeks of confrontations and protests outside the site. The president has also vowed to dispatch National Guard troops to Portland.",
      "\"We should use some of these dangerous cities as training grounds for our military,\" Mr. Trump told military leaders Tuesday.",
      "Rachel  Gold and \n                                                  \n                      Nicole  Valdes\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-split-up-mmr-vaccine-long-settled-debate/",
    "published": "Thu, 02 Oct 2025 16:53:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's suggestion\u200b that the combination measles, mumps and rubella vaccine should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's suggestion last week that combination childhood vaccines, including the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, shot, should be separated marks a sharp break from decades of immunization practice in the United States.",
      "\"I was shocked,\" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Those vaccines don't even exist in the U.S.\"",
      "Moss said he hadn't heard such a recommendation \"since the Andrew Wakefield days,\" referring to the former doctor whose 1988 autism study was later retracted as fraudulent.",
      "Investigations revealed Wakefield had undisclosed financial interests in both lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers and a single-measles vaccine patent. His license to practice medicine was revoked.",
      "Mr. Trump's remarks also drew in Wakefield himself. In a video posted on social media, he said the president was \"adopting the very recommendation that I made back in 1998,\" when he first called for splitting the MMR vaccine into individual components.",
      "\"This is a return to a discredited strategy,\" Moss said. \"Wakefield had a financial stake in undermining MMR, and the science has never supported his claims.\"",
      "Risks of splitting the MMR vaccine",
      "The stakes of splitting a combination vaccine are not abstract, Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and medical historian, said.",
      "\"The immunization schedules are very carefully worked out so the vaccines have the most immunogenicity at the right age,\" he explained. \"If you start splitting things up, you create barriers. Parents don't always come back, or they pick and choose, and coverage goes down. It's as simple as that.\"",
      "Dr. Peter Hotez, a pediatric infectious disease specialist and vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, argued that the call to split vaccines is part of a broader campaign to discredit vaccinations.",
      "\"Every couple of weeks, there's a new zinger: first thimerosal, then spacing, then aluminum, now splitting MMR,\" he said. \"Eventually, this topples the whole vaccine infrastructure like a house of cards.\"",
      "The medical risks of dismantling the MMR schedule are clear. Measles remains one of the most contagious viruses in circulation, capable of igniting outbreaks wherever vaccination rates dip. Rubella infection during pregnancy can cause congenital rubella syndrome, leaving babies with deafness, blindness or heart defects. Mumps, too often dismissed as mild, can lead to infertility in adolescent males.",
      "The programmatic consequences are equally significant. Moss pointed out that parents already complain about too many injections. Splitting MMR into separate shots would increase both the number of visits and the number of needles children face, while weakening protection against rubella and mumps.",
      "Every extra appointment creates barriers, especially for families with limited resources, Markel said.",
      "Dr. Walt Orenstein, a former head of CDC's immunization program, described combination vaccines as the foundation of modern prevention.",
      "\"Combination vaccines were developed to reduce missed opportunities, increase coverage and minimize the trauma of multiple injections,\" he said. \"Undoing that progress would put children at risk.\"",
      "Measles-only vaccines also don't exist in the U.S. You can't walk into a pediatrician's office or retail pharmacy and ask for a standalone shot.",
      "To make a measles-only vaccine available in the United States, a manufacturer would need to wait for measles outbreaks to occur, in order to test the vaccine in new clinical trials. Then they'd have to submit data for FDA approval and build a production and distribution system essentially from scratch. With no market for monovalent measles vaccines, companies would also have to be convinced there was sustainable demand \u2014 something experts say is unlikely given the entrenched use of MMR.",
      "Recycled claims",
      "Objections to combined vaccines are not new, UC Berkeley medical historian Elena Conis noted.",
      "\"Resistance to vaccines and concerns about the form and content of vaccines is as old as vaccination itself,\" she said. \"And concerns about combined vaccines are as old as combined vaccines themselves.\"",
      "She pointed out that even before Wakefield, parents in the 1970s were asking why they couldn't just get some vaccines separately, echoing debates over the DPT (Diphtheria, Tetanus and Pertussis) vaccine at the time.",
      "New momentum to separate measles from the rubella component is also driven by a recurring myth: that the rubella vaccine \"contains fetal parts.\" In reality, the rubella virus was originally grown in human fetal cell lines developed in the 1960s, which have been replicated ever since without further abortions.",
      "During production, the virus is purified, leaving only trace DNA or protein fragments that are broken, biologically inactive, and present at levels far below natural background levels in food or the human body. Regulators such as the Food and Drug Administration confirm these levels are safe. Advocates for separating MMR often conflate this history with the false claim that vaccines contain fetal tissue. Decoupling rubella is presented as a moral corrective, even though it introduces practical barriers and undermines protection for pregnant women and babies.",
      "Conis also emphasized that resistance often depends on how people perceive the seriousness of each disease.",
      "The public didn't always see the various infections as equal, Conis noted. At times rubella drew more fear than measles or mumps.",
      "Mumps in particular, she said, \"was often treated with humor rather than fear, until the MMR vaccine came along and researchers began to highlight complications like infertility and hearing loss.\"",
      "Japan offers a cautionary example. In the early 1990s, Japan withdrew the combined MMR vaccine following concerns about the safety of its mumps vaccine and reverted to measles-only shots. The result was lower uptake of rubella and mumps vaccines compared to measles, leaving gaps in protection.",
      "Decades later, Japan has faced repeated rubella outbreaks, including epidemics in 2013 and 2018-2019 that sickened thousands and led to cases of congenital rubella syndrome. Because of earlier policies that vaccinated only girls against rubella, large cohorts of adult men remain under-immunized, forcing costly catch-up campaigns and leaving Japan vulnerable to epidemics.",
      "Dr. Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, warned splitting up the MMR vaccine would repeat past mistakes.",
      "\"We've been here before. Andrew Wakefield promoted single-antigen vaccines, and it nearly derailed measles control in the U.K. The science was fraudulent, but the damage was real: thousands of kids went unprotected. To revive that model in 2025 is to repeat one of the most damaging chapters in vaccine history.\"",
      "Columbia University historian James Colgrove noted that this kind of backlash has deep roots.",
      "\"The original anti-vaccination movement in the 19th century was really a movement against state coercion,\" he said. \"That's always been the paradox of compulsory vaccination: it's extremely effective, but it's also one of the most likely to trigger backlash.\"",
      "Conis framed the debate in broader terms of autonomy and mandates.",
      "\"There's always been a tension in vaccination between individual choice and public health,\" she said. \"Parents are asked to give up some autonomy for the promise of better health for the population. For some, that's acceptable. For others, individual freedom matters more, and what's different today is that we're seeing the libertarian approach gain support at the highest levels of government.\"",
      "Colgrove added that policymakers face a delicate balance. \"The non-medical exemptions absolutely make laws more politically acceptable and are really key to diffusing backlash,\" he said. \"At the same time, the broader your exemption, the more people you allow to opt out, then the more you risk compromising herd immunity. So it really is threading the needle.\"",
      "And for Offit, the bigger danger is the pattern of misinformation itself.",
      "\"These claims aren't new; they're recycled,\" he said. \"Once doubt takes root, it's extraordinarily hard to restore public confidence.\"",
      "Research from multiple countries shows that combination vaccines improve uptake and timeliness by reducing missed appointments and the number of injections required. Children receiving combination formulations are more likely to complete their full schedule on time, and low-income parents are less likely to fall behind when multiple protections are delivered in a single shot.",
      "For Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's immunization program who recently resigned, the proposal reflects politics rather than science.",
      "\"This isn't about safety. It's about ideology,\" he said. \"We've already seen directives issued without data to back them up.\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry, who recently resigned as the CDC's chief science and medical officer, echoed the concern.",
      "\"The talk about separating MMR into individual components wasn't coming from scientists,\" she said. \"It was being driven by political operatives with no public health expertise.\"",
      "According to Moss: \"It's not necessary, and monovalent vaccines aren't even available in the United States. There's no reason to go down that path.\"",

      "The firings come amid turmoil in the U.S. Attorney's office in Alexandria, Virginia, days after the Justice Department filed criminal charges there against Comey. Mr. Trump removed his own appointee, Erik Siebert, from the post of U.S. Attorney, and installed White House aide Lindsey Halligan to be the new federal prosecutor in eastern Virginia. Halligan successfully secured a grand jury indictment of Comey days later. Staff at the U.S. Attorney's office had circulated a memo arguing the charges shouldn't be brought, CBS News has reported.",
      "Home to the Pentagon and the CIA headquarters, the Eastern District of Virginia is one of the largest federal prosecutor offices in the United States, with hundreds of staff and a uniquely broad set of international and terror cases.",

Sharifullah is scheduled to go on trial later this year.",

      "The head of a presidential library resigned this week after a tug-of-war with the Trump administration over gift selection and a sword for King Charles III, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Todd Arrington, a career historian who previously held posts with the National Park Service and National Archives and Records Administration, said he stepped down on Monday under pressure as director of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library, Museum and Boyhood Home.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Arrington said he was told on Monday, \"Resign \u2014 or be fired.\"",
      "\"Apparently, they believed I could no longer be trusted with confidential information,\" he said. When asked what specific confidential information he'd shared, Arrington said it was \"about the sword\" and an unrelated matter.",
      "Arrington's departure came after he resisted taking an original Eisenhower sword out of the library's collection to give to King Charles last month during President Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the United Kingdom.",
      "Four U.S. officials involved in the lavish royal visit were unaware that the library director had left his job, and said the White House played no role in his exit.",
      "In a statement last month, Buckingham Palace didn't specify which sword was given to the monarch, but noted that Charles was given a replica, saying the gift \"symbolizes profound respect and is a reminder of the historical partnership that was critical to winning World War II.\" Buckingham Palace declined further comment.",
      "A former Army general, Eisenhower possessed several swords, including a Sword of Honor given to him in 1947 by the city of London for his role as allied supreme commander during World War II, an honor saber gifted to him by the Netherlands in 1947, and his West Point officer saber.",
      "It is not clear who specifically requested the sword. First lady Melania Trump personally decided which gifts to give Queen Camilla, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their children, a senior administration official said.",
      "Officials at the State Department who compiled an array of gift options for the first couple sought an Eisenhower sword to reiterate the significance of the U.S.-U.K. relationship since World War II, sources said. But Arrington argued against giving away an artifact that had been accepted as a donation and had become the property of the American people.",
      "Arrington told officials he could help find an alternative gift, but sources say State Department officials persisted. The library's team offered to help find a replica.",
      "Ultimately, West Point provided a Cadet Saber from the military academy.",
      "Arrington said he never spoke with anyone at the White House, but only with officials in the Foreign Gift Office at the State Department and other colleagues at the National Archives.",
      "Some in the Trump administration were unhappy with Arrington, sources said.",
      "NARA didn't reply to requests for comment, nor did the Eisenhower library, but both entities began operating Wednesday with limited staffing due to the shutdown of the federal government.",
      "Two sources close to the matter said no one said anything to Arrington about being upset about not being able to have a museum piece \u2014 the conversations before the U.K. trip about finding a substitute for the real sword were polite and tension-free.",
      "One administration official said Arrington was believed to have spoken critically about the president and the administration \u2014 something Arrington strongly disputes.",

    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "One of the main lines of attack the White House and Republican lawmakers have leveled against Democrats amid the government shutdown is the claim that Democratic lawmakers want to give immigrants in the U.S. illegally free health care \u2014 which Democrats deny.",
      "\"Democrats are holding the American government HOSTAGE so they can give FREE health care to ILLEGAL ALIENS,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, said on social media Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Vice President JD Vance accused Democrats of wanting to \"take from the American people in order to give taxpayer-funded healthcare to illegal immigrants.\"",
      "Trump administration officials and Republican lawmakers have pointed to a provision in the Democrats' funding proposal that would reverse the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's measures narrowing Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens. The changes sought by Democrats would only extend Medicaid coverage to immigrants with some kind of legal status or government protection.",
      "Before the bill passed earlier this year, U.S. law allowed several classes of immigrants living in the U.S. legally or with the government's permission to apply for and get Medicaid, if they met other requirements.",
      "Those groups included lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally, people granted a humanitarian benefit known as \"parole\" to enter the country, refugees, immigrants who won asylum and others, including those who were issued deportation reprieves by a judge.",
      "Some people in those groups may have crossed into the U.S. illegally but were later granted legal status, like asylum, or deportation deferrals by immigration judges.",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 passed by lawmakers and signed by President Trump over the summer \u2014 significantly restricted noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid coverage, making it only accessible to lawful permanent residents, Cubans and Haitians who entered the U.S. legally and noncitizens from several Pacific islands.",
      "The bill excluded those granted parole to enter the U.S., refugees, asylees and the other previously eligible immigrants. Roughly 1.4 million immigrants could lose health insurance coverage under the bill's provisions, according to a KFF analysis of Congressional Budget Office data.",
      "The Democrats' funding proposal would restore noncitizen eligibility for Medicaid to the longstanding pre-2025 rules, reopening access for the classes of immigrants who were carved out earlier this year. All of those immigrants are in the U.S. either legally or with the government's permission.",
      "U.S. law has long rendered people living in the U.S. illegally \u2014 without any type of legal status \u2014 ineligible for most federal benefits, including Medicaid.",
      "Trump administration officials, however, have argued that some of the lawfully present immigrants previously eligible for Medicaid were illegally let in by the Biden administration. They argue that in the case of those granted parole, the Biden administration waved them in using a \"magic wand,\" in violation of federal immigration law.",
      "The groups of people granted parole under former President Biden \u2014 such as Venezuelans and Ukrainians \u2014 entered the country with the government's permission and were authorized to work and live in the U.S. The Trump administration has suspended those Biden-era parole programs, and revoked the legal status of many of those who arrived under them.",
      "The legal status of many of the other immigrants eligible for Medicaid before the One Big Beautiful Bill act \u2014 like the refugees and asylees \u2014 is not disputed. Both refugees and asylees are on a path to permanent legal status and, eventually, U.S. citizenship.",
      "While people who are in the U.S. illegally are not covered by federal Medicaid, the program may reimburse hospitals providing emergency care to immigrants who lack legal status. Emergency funding for noncitizens constitutes less than 1% of total spending for the program, according to an analysis by KFF. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act lowered the amount hospitals can receive for these ER visits, which the Democrats' government funding plan would reverse.",
      "Democratic leaders have denied that they're seeking to fund health care for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The position of most Democrats is that they will not vote for a short-term funding extension that would allow the government to reopen unless Republicans extend Affordable Care Act tax credits that have helped millions of Americans lower their health insurance costs.",
      "\"Federal law prohibits the use of taxpayer dollars to provide medical coverage to undocumented individuals. And there is nothing in anything that we have proposed that is trying to change that law,\" House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Tuesday. \"We are fighting for the health care of the American people.\"",
      "Some Republicans have also argued that if Democrats restore the federal Medicaid funding that was cut in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it would allow Democratic-led states to spend more state funds on health care for immigrants residing in the country unlawfully.",
      "According to an\u00a0analysis by nonpartisan health care researchers at KFF, more than a dozen states comprehensively cover care for low-income children who lack a legal immigration status using state funds. Some states, including California, provide some form of coverage to adults living in the country without authorization.",
      "Republicans previously attempted to penalize these states in Mr. Trump's budget bill, but that provision did not make it into the final legislation.",

    "summary": "A shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion each week, according to one analysis.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The fight over funding the government is likely to be a costly one.",
      "Each week of the ongoing government shutdown could cost the economy $7 billion and reduce GDP growth by 0.1 percentage points, according to an estimate published by EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. That cost is a function of reduced pay for federal employees, delayed government procurement of goods and a decline in demand.",
      "To some extent, a portion of that economic cost would be reversed when the government reopens, as furloughed employees receive back pay and economic activity increases, the analysis said.",
      "It's likely that not everything would be reversible, though. The last shutdown \u2014 which was during President Trump's first term and lasted 34 days, beginning in December 2018 and ending in January 2019 \u2014 cost the U.S. economy about $11 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "During that shutdown, the longest on record, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that real gross domestic product in the fourth quarter of 2018 took a $3 billion hit (in 2019 dollars). And it estimated that in the first quarter of 2019, real GDP was \"$8 billion lower than it would have been \u2014 an effect reflecting both the five-week partial shutdown and the resumption in economic activity once funding resumed.\"",
      "The shutdown could shake Americans' faith in the economy, too. EY-Parthenon notes that at the time, the 2019 shutdown led to the sharpest monthly drop in the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Index up since 2012.",
      "Some of the shutdown costs also stem from the administrative effort necessary to create contingency plans when the government is shut down and reopened. Agencies lose user fees collected from visitors to the national parks or from people seeking certain federal permits or visas. And there are higher premiums in federal contracting during a shutdown and the back pay federal employees eventually receive when the government reopens.",
      "Current federal law requires that federal workers be paid at their regular rate, whether they're furloughed or not, once the government is operating again. In a new analysis cited by the White House, the Congressional Budget Office estimates the federal government will pay $400 million a day for furloughed employees, who will not be working during the shutdown.",
      "A September 2019 report from a Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subcommittee estimated the last three government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 \"cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion \u2014 at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed federal workers, and at least $338 million in other costs associated with the shutdowns, including extra administrative work, lost revenue, and late fees on interest payments.\"",
      "The White House Office of Management and Budget estimated that during the 16-day shutdown of 2013, federal employees received $2.5 billion in pay and benefits for hours they did not work, plus $10 million in penalty interest payments and lost fees.",
      "2025 shutdown",
      "But this time may be different. President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Russell Vought, the OMB director, say layoffs will happen soon if the shutdown continues, so the net fiscal impact of a shutdown to the federal government is a little harder to predict right now. Vought immediately began freezing or slashing federal funding for projects, largely in blue states, during the shutdown. The Trump administration is withholding $18 billion in infrastructure projects in New York City, and cutting funding for climate-related projects in many states that Kamala Harris won.",
      "Vought also told Republican lawmakers Wednesday that Reduction in Force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 cuts would begin in two days.",
      "The president said Tuesday \"a lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" and suggested Vought could use the shutdown to permanently cut federal workers and programs the administration doesn't want but that have the backing of Democrats.",
      "\"We can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible for them, that are bad for them and irreversible by them,\" Mr. Trump said of Democrats. \"Like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration said Wednesday that it is freezing roughly $18 billion in federal funding for a pair of New York City infrastructure projects, targeting the home state of both Democratic congressional leaders on the first day of the government shutdown.",
      "Russ Vought, head of the White House Office of Management and Budget, announced the freeze in a post on X, saying funding for the Hudson Tunnel Project and Second Avenue Subway would be halted pending a review that will be delayed due to furloughs during the funding lapse.",
      "New York is home to both Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, and the Department of Transportation linked the leaders to the project freeze in its announcement.",
      "Vought said the federal money for the two projects will be \"put on hold to ensure funding is not flowing based on unconstitutional DEI principles.\" DEI refers to \"diversity, equity and inclusion\" policies, which have been top targets of the Trump administration.",
      "In a\u00a0statement, the Transportation Department said the infrastructure projects are \"under administrative review to determine whether any unconstitutional practices are occurring.\" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, the statement said, believes \"subsidizing infrastructure contracts with taxpayer dollars based on discriminatory principles is unconstitutional, counter to civil rights laws, and a waste of taxpayer resources.\"",
      "\"The department is focusing on these projects because they are arguably the largest infrastructure initiatives in the western hemisphere, and the American people want to see them completed quickly and efficiently,\" DOT said. \"Until USDOT's quick administrative review is complete, project reimbursements cannot be processed, including a $300 million disbursement for the 2nd Avenue Subway.\"",
      "The department said the remaining federal funding for the projects is roughly $18 billion.",
      "\"Thanks to the Chuck Schumer and Hakeem [Jeffries] shutdown, however, USDOT's review of New York's unconstitutional practices will take more time. Without a budget, the department has been forced to furlough the civil rights staff responsible for conducting this review,\" the statement said.",
      "New York City voters also lean heavily Democratic.",
      "In a joint statement, Jeffries and Schumer said the projects \"aren't political trophies \u2014 they are lifelines.\"",
      "\"They mean tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs. They mean shorter commutes, safer travel and a stronger economy not just for New York, but for the entire nation,\" the leaders said. \"Choking off these projects out of spite will damage America's competitiveness and cost working families dearly.\"",
      "Asked at the Capitol if he is being targeted, Jeffries said, \"The Trump administration is targeting the jobs, thousands of jobs of hard-working Americans. Working-class Americans and blue collar Americans will lose the ability to work at the Second Avenue Subway site or at the other project that has been canceled related to the Cross-Harbor Tunnel.\"",
      "Asked about the move, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"Vote to open up the government, that issue goes away, right?\"",
      "The Senate has failed to approve House-passed legislation to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, sending the country into a government shutdown on Wednesday morning.",
      "The Hudson Tunnel Project is a decadelong effort to build a new two-tube rail tunnel under the Hudson River and rehab the existing North River Tunnels for Amtrak and NJ Transit traffic on the Northeast Corridor, the busiest Amtrak region in the country. The Second Avenue Subway project, which is currently in its second phase, aims to extend the Q subway line into East Harlem and Harlem, as well as add new stations.",

    "summary": "Pfizer's CEO said President Trump's threat of tariffs motivated his company to take swift action.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Pfizer has agreed to offer significantly discounted prices for some prescription drugs for all American consumers and has committed to offer prescription medications to Medicaid at lower prices, President Trump announced Tuesday. The president said the drugs will be available for purchase online on a website operated by the federal government, which the White House has said will be called \"TrumpRx.\"",
      "\"Today, I'm thrilled to announce that one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers and one of the best anywhere in the world, Pfizer, has agreed to offer countless prescription medications at major discounts in the United States, a result of the 'most favored nation' drug pricing order that we established earlier this year,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office.",
      "Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla, who was in the Oval Office with the president for the announcement, said Mr. Trump's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured outside the U.S. motivated his company to take swift action. The president said Pfizer's drug prices will be lower starting \"immediately.\"",
      "The president said the cost of some Pfizer drugs could see decreases in price of 50%-100%. Mr. Trump said this would save American consumers and taxpayers \"hundreds of millions of dollars a year.\" The president said Americans have been \"subsidizing research and development costs for the entire planet\" because of the higher prices they have been paying.",
      "\"We're also announcing that moving forward, all new medications introduced by Pfizer to the American market will be sold at the reduced 'most favored nation' cost,\" the president added. \"So, we'll be paying essentially what other countries are paying, who have been much lower \u2014 much, much lower for many, many years.\"",
      "Neither Pfizer nor the White House has released specific drug prices yet.",
      "Some health policy experts cautioned that pricing details are still unclear and the impact for consumers may be limited.",
      "Darius Lakdawalla, chief scientific officer at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center, pointed out that Medicaid's prices are already lower than average in the U.S.",
      "\"Medicaid already enjoys 'best-price' protection in the sense that they receive the lowest prices charged to any commercial payer in the United States. Therefore, we are starting out at prices well below the averages seen in the U.S. market,\" he told CBS News.",
      "And those patients have been benefiting, says Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the Program on Medicare Policy at\u00a0KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization: \"It is still very unclear how the price reductions announced today will lower costs directly for many people, since people on Medicaid typically don't pay large amounts out of pocket for drugs.\"",
      "Sean Sullivan, a health economist at the University of Washington, said: \"The direct-to-patient stuff is, in my view, a sideshow and branding opportunity for Trump. Most patients have drug coverage. \u2026 Very few are going to buy medications with cash, unless the drug is not a covered benefit, like weight loss or erectile dysfunction drugs.\"",
      "Bourla called it a \"historic day\" because the agreement would be reversing an \"unfair situation.\"",
      "\"For years, other rich nations refused to pay their fair share for medical innovation,\" Bourla said. \"And as a result, Americans had to assume disproportionate costs.\"",
      "The Pfizer agreement is a part of the White House agenda to secure \"most favored nation\" pricing with pharmaceutical manufacturers. In May, Mr. Trump signed an executive order\u00a0calling on\u00a0drugmakers to lower their prices and bring them in line with what other high-income countries pay for the same drugs. He threatened to subject them to steep caps on how much they can earn from Medicare if they failed to do so.",
      "Monday was the deadline for drugmakers to reach agreements to bring down drug costs, the Post reported, after the president's May executive order. While the U.S. has less than 5% of the world's population and uses about 13% of the world's prescription drugs, the U.S. funds over 70% of global pharmaceutical profits, according to the White House.",
      "The president's announcement comes days after he announced that on Wednesday, the U.S. would begin imposing a 100% tariff on any branded or patented pharmaceutical product \"unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America.\" That move could increase the costs of some drugs for consumers.",
      "Bourla mentioned the impending tariffs in his comments Tuesday, saying the tariffs had motivated his company. He said the Mr. Trump gave Pfizer a three-year grace period on the tariffs, and the tariffs would be inapplicable, as long as Pfizer manufactures in the U.S. As a part of the agreement, Bourla said Pfizer agreed to move their production of medicines used in America to the U.S.",
      "\"The president is absolutely right, tariff is the most powerful tool to motivate behaviors, Mr. President,\" Bourla said. \"And clearly motivated ours, right?\"",
      "Mr. Trump also said the tariffs had \"played a big role\" in the deal.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said more details of agreements by pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices will come this fall. Mr. Trump echoed that point, saying other companies are on board, too.",
      "\"President Trump is doing more to lower healthcare costs than anyone else in Washington, D.C.,\" said White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai ahead of the president's announcement. \"While Democrats are threatening to shut down the government to subsidize health care for illegal aliens, President Trump is leveraging the power of the federal government to drastically cut drug prices for everyday Americans. Democrats talked the talk for decades about drug prices, but only President Trump is actually walking the walk.\"",
      "The details of the \"TrumpRx\" website have not yet been shared, but a senior administration official expected the website to be live in early 2026.",
      "The announcement comes as Democrats remain at an impasse with the president and Republicans over keeping the government funded beyond midnight: they say the president is not doing enough to lower health care prices, and they've been pushing for an extension of the Affordable Care Act before premiums increase for many who have health care through the ACA.",

      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro said. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of \"any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\" The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

      "Unlike Earth and other planets in our solar system, which orbit the sun, rogue planets float freely through the universe untethered to a star.",
      "Scientists estimate there could be trillions of rogue planets in our galaxy alone \u2014 but they are difficult to spot because they mostly drift quietly along in perpetual night.",
      "\"People may think of planets as quiet and stable worlds, but with this discovery we see that planetary-mass objects freely floating in space can be exciting places,\" V\u00edctor Almendros-Abad, a lead author of the new study, said in a\u00a0statement.",
      "These strange objects intrigue astronomers because they are \"neither a star nor a proper planet,\" Alexander Scholz, an astronomer at Scotland's University of St. Andrews and co-author of a new study, told AFP.",
      "\"Their origin remains an open question: are they the lowest-mass objects formed like stars, or giant planets ejected from their birth systems?\"",
      "Rogue planet found growing at record rate: six billion tonnes a second!\n\nUnlike the planets in our Solar System, rogue...",
      "The team of researchers behind the new study was stunned to observe an astonishing growth spurt in a rogue planet around 620 light years from Earth in the constellation Chamaeleon.",
      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",
      "The object grows by sucking in matter from a disc that surrounds it \u2014 a process called accretion.",
      "But what the astronomers saw happen to Cha 1107-7626 \"blurs the line between stars and planets,\" study co-author Belinda Damian said in a statement.",
      "In August this year, the planet suddenly started devouring matter from its disc at a record-breaking 6 billion tons per second \u2014 eight times faster than a few months earlier.",
      "\"This is the strongest accretion episode ever recorded for a planetary-mass object,\" said Almendros-Abad.",
      "\"Awe-inspiring\"",
      "By comparing light emitted before and during this binge-eating session, the scientists discovered that magnetic activity was playing a role in driving matter towards the object.",
      "This phenomenon has previously only been observed in stars.",
      "The chemistry in the disc also changed. Water vapour was detected in the disc during the accretion episode, but not beforehand.",
      "This is also something that has previously been observed in stars \u2014 but never for a forming planet.",
      "Lead study author Ray Jayawardhana of Johns Hopkins University said the discovery implies \"that some objects comparable to giant planets form the way stars do, from contracting clouds of gas and dust accompanied by discs of their own, and they go through growth episodes just like newborn stars.\"",
      "No matter how weird, Cha 1107-7626 is still expected to have similar characteristics to huge planets, because it is of similar size.",
      "Scholz said that, unlike stars, this object is \"not massive enough to ever have fusion reactions in the core.\"",
      "So, like other planets, \"it will cool inevitably as it gets older,\" he added.",

      "The planet, officially called Cha 1107-7626, has a mass five to 10 times bigger than Jupiter.",
      "Scholz explained that the object is \"still in its infancy,\" being roughly 1 or 2 million years old.",

    "summary": "Dutch producer pitches her AI creation, Tilly Norwood, as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says several agents are vying to represent it.",
    "story": [
      "Like thousands of actors, Tilly Norwood is looking for a Hollywood agent. Her greatest role? Pretending to be human.",
      "That's because Tilly Norwood is a 100% AI-generated product, created by Dutch producer and comedian Eline Van der Velden, founder of a company named Xicoia, which bills itself as the world's first artificial intelligence talent studio. Velden pitches her AI creation as the next Scarlett Johansson, and says there are several agents vying to represent it, CBS News' Jo Ling Kent reported recently.",
      "Since Velden launched the digital character's prospective career, Tilly Norwood has been all the talk in Hollywood.",
      "But not in a good way. Guilds, actors and filmmakers have met the Xicoia product with an immediate wave of backlash, protesting that artificial intelligence should not have a starring role in the acting profession. In a statement Tuesday, the Screen Actors Guild said that \"creativity is, and should remain, human-centered.\"",
      "\"To be clear, 'Tilly Norwood' is not an actor, it's a character generated by a computer program that was trained on the work of countless professional performers \u2014 without permission or compensation,\" the guild said. \"It has no life experience to draw from, no emotion and, from what we've seen, audiences aren't interested in watching computer-generated content untethered from the human experience.\"",
      "Actor Sean Astin, who starred in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Goonies,\" and was recently elected president of SAG-AFTRA, also emphasized how AI actors are artificial constructs trained off of work by real performers.",
      "\"You're made up of stuff that doesn't belong to you,\" he told CBS News. \"Let's just make sure that credit is given where credit is due.\"",
      "Van der Velden, who is also the founder of the AI production studio Particle6, promoted Tilly Norwood last month at the Zurich Summit, the industry sidebar of the Zurich Film Festival. It was there that she said talent agencies were circling Norwood and that she expected to soon announce a signing.",
      "Many in Hollywood hope that never happens.",
      "\"Any talent agency that engages in this should be boycotted by all guilds,\" wrote Natasha Lyonne on Instagram. The \"Russian Doll\" star is directing a feature titled \"Uncanny Valley\" that pledges to use \"ethical\" artificial intelligence in combination with traditional filmmaking techniques. \"Deeply misguided & totally disturbed,\" she added. \"Not the way. Not the vibe. Not the use.\"",
      "Artificial intelligence is often used as a tool in film production, though its implementation is hotly debated. It was a major bargaining point in the lengthy strike by SAG-AFTRA that concluded in late 2023 with some safeguards put in place to protect the use of actors' likenesses and performances by AI. A yearlong strike by video game actors hinged on AI protections. In July, video game actors approved a new contract that mandates employers obtain written permission to create a digital replica.",
      "But there have been numerous controversies over the use of AI in acting. The Oscar-winning 2024 film \"The Brutalist\" used artificial intelligence for Hungarian dialogue spoken by Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones' characters, the revelation of which prompted debate in the industry.",
      "Van der Velden responded to the stir around Tilly Norwood on Instagram.",
      "\"To those who have expressed anger over the creation of my AI character, Tilly Norwood, she is not a replacement for a human being, but a creative work \u2014 a piece of art,\" Van der Velden said on Sunday. \"Like many forms of art before her, she sparks conversation, and that in itself shows the power of creativity.\"",
      "Van der Velden didn't respond to interview requests Tuesday. In her post, she argued that AI characters should be judged as their own genre.",
      "\"Creating Tilly has been, for me, an act of imagination and craftsmanship, not unlike drawing a character, writing a role or shaping a performance,\" she added. \"It takes time, skill and iteration to bring such a character to life.\"",
      "That statement was also shared on Tilly Norwood's own Instagram account. Posts include photos of the creation drinking coffee, shopping for clothes and preparing for various projects. As of Tuesday, the account had more than 33,000 followers.",

      "\"Had such a blast filming some screen tests recently,\" one post reads. \"Every day feels like a step closer to the big screen.\"",
      "Asked what human actors bring to a performance that AI can't, Astin said \"authenticity,\" adding, \"You can fall in love. Your parents can die. You can you can be in some terrifying situation. The sum of all of our emotional experiences in our life, artificial intelligence can approximate it \u2014 it is not real.\"",

      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue-collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting, according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",

      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions.",

      "OpenAI announced Tuesday that it is directing teens to an age-appropriate version of its ChatGPT technology as it seeks to bolster safeguards amid a period of heightened scrutiny over the chatbot's safety.",
      "Users of the chatbot identified as under the age of 18 will automatically be directed to a version of ChatGPT governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules, OpenAI said in a\u00a0statement. This under-age edition includes protection policies such as blocking sexual content and \u2014 \"in rare cases of acute distress\" \u2014 law enforcement to ensure a user's safety, according to the company.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "OpenAI also said it is introducing parental controls, such as enabling parents to link their account to their teen's account, manage chat history, set blackout hours and more. The safeguards will be available by the end of September.",
      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",
      "It's unclear how OpenAI plans to indentify users' ages, however, it stated that if ChatGPT is unsure about someone's age, or has incomplete information, it will default to the under-18 version.",
      "OpenAI did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Other tech companies have taken similar steps to shield teen users from inappropriate content. YouTube, for example, announced a new age-estimation technology that will track the types of videos users watch and how long they've had their account to verify if they are under the age of 18.",
      "According\u00a0to an April Pew Research Center report, parents are generally more worried about the mental health of teenagers than are teens themselves. Among those parents who are at least somewhat concerned about teen mental health, 44% said social media had the biggest negative impact on adolescents.",

    "story": [
      "When Anna Whitlock was let go from her job in the technology industry in November of 2024, she wasn't worried about lining up a new position. The Washington state resident had 11 years of experience managing network infrastructure projects, a specialized role that involves equipping buildings with internet access, cameras and wifi security systems.",
      "\"The last time I had to job search, I found something pretty easily,\" she said.",
      "Almost a year later, the 37-year-old is still without a job. Whitlock said she has applied to hundreds of jobs \u2014 even for positions she's overqualified for \u2014 to no avail.",
      "\"The more I looked, the more I wasn't getting responses. If I did have an interview, I only made it the first one or two rounds,\" said Whitlock, who has a 16-year-old daughter. \"Things got really real when my unemployment ran out.\"",
      "Sidelined for months",
      "While the government's September jobs report\u00a0wasn't released on Friday\u00a0because of the government shutdown, other recent economic signals point to an increasingly challenging job market for people like Whitlock. Private employers\u00a0declined by 32,000 jobs\u00a0in September, according to payroll processing firm ADP. The number of job openings around the U.S. has also steadily dropped, economic data shows.",
      "And while the nation's unemployment rate remains historically low, at 4.3%, the share of Americans defined as long-term unemployed \u2014 or those unemployed for 27 weeks or longer \u2014 has risen to 26%, the highest in more than three years, labor data shows.",
      "As of August, the number of long-term unemployed people had risen to 1.9 million, according to government data \u2014 the highest level since 2021, when the nation was still reeling from the pandemic.",
      "With the job market faltering in recent months as employers put the brakes on hiring, more workers are being sidelined for months on end, economists told CBS News.",
      "\"We're continuing to see this low-hire, low-fire environment,\" said Laura Ullrich, Indeed's director of economic research for North America and a former official at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"There aren't really new jobs being opened up for people \u2014 there isn't room for new people to come in.\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Thursday captures the dimming view many Americans have of the labor market, with 33% of respondents describing it as \"good,\" down from 41% in April. What's more, 48% said they think there are fewer good jobs where they live compared to five years ago.",
      "1,000 job applications",
      "The rise in long-term unemployed Americans poses two risks, Ullrich said. Workers themselves can suffer financial setbacks as they burn through savings and take on debt to stay afloat. And the broader U.S. economy can suffer if people give up on looking for work after becoming discouraged at the prospects of finding a job.",
      "\"Folks who do go into this long-term unemployment category, it's harder for them to get back into the labor force,\" he said. \"The concern is that they become discouraged workers and they stop working, and then they fall out of the labor force entirely.\"",
      "People who have been hunting for a job for months say the process is both frustrating and demoralizing, especially after sending hundreds of applications that fail to get a response. James Strawn, 55, a software quality expert in Colorado who lost his job in July, said he's submitted 100 applications and only received one response.",
      "\"I've had people say, 'Those are rookie numbers, like that is nothing \u2014 I've submitted 1,000 applications',\" he told CBS News. \"Every morning when I get on LinkedIn \u2014 I'm on there all day now \u2014 I see another post that's like another horror story of looking for jobs.\"",
      "Strawn said he was rejected from a minimum wage job at a fitness center, and has taken on a seasonal job at UPS. But he's increasingly fearful that he may not find work in his technology field by year-end, when his severance pay runs out.",
      "Strawn also worries that ageism could be playing a role in his struggle to land a job in his field. \"It's going to take a small miracle to find something,\" he said. \"It's really tough \u2014 it's really a bad market.\"",
      "It's not only experienced workers who are struggling. Young workers and recent college graduates are also having a hard time breaking into the job market. Because there's a glut of workers looking for jobs, employers are requiring that applicants have more extensive \u00a0resumes, Ullrich told CBS News.",
      "\"They are asking for more years of experience, like nine-plus,\" she said. \"Most of it is because they can.\"",
      "The unemployment rate for 16-to-24-year-olds is \"slowly but steadily rising,\" said Elise Gould, an economist at the liberal-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"I was quickly humbled\"",
      "Matthew McMeans, who graduated from the University of Memphis last year, estimates he applied to roughly 500 jobs during an 18-month job search before landing a position as a full stack software engineer in early August. He described the job hunt as \"miserable\" and \"degrading\" given the difficulty in landing interviews.",
      "\"When I started my degree, the hopes were really high that you were going to get multiple offers when you graduated,\" the 23-year-old said. \"But as soon as I started really searching and applying, I was quickly humbled.\"",
      "The wobbly labor market has caught the attention of the Federal Reserve, which has a so-called dual mandate to keep both unemployment and inflation low. Last month, the central bank\u00a0cut interest rates for the first time since December 2024 in an effort to bolster the labor market.",
      "But even if the job market improves, for many the damage has already been done. Whitlock, the IT professional who has been unemployed for almost a year, said she's managed to get assistance through programs like SNAP, better known as food stamps, and to negotiate down her cell phone and car insurance bills.",
      "But she was also forced to liquidate her retirement fund and a small investment account to make sure she had enough to live on.",
      "Said Whitlock, \"I'm probably right now in a position where I've got maybe three months until I'm in a really bad spot.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court convenes for a new term Monday and is set to hear cases ranging from the use of race in redistricting to Trump's efforts to reshape the executive branch.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Monday for the start of its new term, with cases involving \"conversion therapy\" for minors, the use of race in redistricting, gun rights and state laws barring the participation of transgender athletes in girls' sports on the docket.",
      "But looming over the high court's newest term are legal battles involving President Trump's policies and efforts to reshape the executive branch \u2014 two will be decided by the Supreme Court in the coming months, though others could be poised for its intervention.",
      "The justices are returning to the bench following a summer recess marked by emergency appeals from the Trump administration on his immigration policies, efforts to cancel research grants, and mass layoffs of federal workers, among others. Mr. Trump has prevailed in most of his bids for emergency relief so far, but whether he will see similar success if the Supreme Court evaluates the merits of his plans remains to be seen.",
      "\"Most Americans aren't following the technicalities on the emergency docket, and so they just think the court is siding with the Trump administration every time,\" Allison Orr Larsen, a law professor at William & Mary, told CBS News. \"Once the cases are back up before the justices and decided on the merits, that's going to do a lot to either cement that assumption or upset that assumption.\"",
      "The president will see the first test of one of his policies Nov. 5, when the Supreme Court considers the legality of his sweeping reciprocal tariffs, which are a centerpiece of his economic agenda. The high court is also set to decide whether Mr. Trump can fire without cause a Democratic-appointed member of the Federal Trade Commission. A decision in favor of the president in that case could invalidate removal protections enacted by Congress for a slew of independent agencies it sought to insulate from political pressure.",
      "The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has also been asked to decide the constitutionality of Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, though it'll be weeks before the high court decides whether to take up the issue.",
      "Roman Martinez, a lawyer at Latham & Watkins who frequently argues before the court, predicted that come next summer, \"the theme is going to be that the court had to confront an energetic executive, very expansive assertions of authority across this whole range of issues.\"",
      "The cases already set to be decided, coupled with those that are likely to be teed up for Supreme Court review, suggest that the term will be marked by disputes involving social issues and challenges to Mr. Trump's executive actions.",
      "\"The docket is already full of blockbuster cases, and that list is going to grow as challenges to the president's executive orders find their way back to the justices after having been dealt with on the emergency docket,\" Larsen said.",
      "Here are the major cases the Supreme Court will hear this term:",
      "\"Conversion therapy\" ban",
      "The Supreme Court will hear arguments Oct. 7 in a challenge to a Colorado law that bans \"conversion therapy\" for minors. Nearly half the states have similar laws in place.",
      "The law, which took effect in September 2019, prohibits \"conversion therapy\" for people under the age of 18. The state defines \"conversion therapy\" as any practice or treatment, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to \"change behaviors or gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attraction or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.\" Violators face fines of up to $5,000 per violation and may be suspended from practicing or stripped of their license.",
      "The case was brought by Kaley Chiles, a licensed counselor in Colorado who performs faith-informed counseling when her clients seek it. Chiles, who is Christian, seeks to engage in talk therapy with young patients who want to \"reduce or eliminate unwanted sexual attractions, change sexual behaviors, or grow in the experience of harmony with [their] physical body,\" according to court filings. But she fears that doing so will leave her in violation of Colorado's law and put her at risk of losing her license.",
      "Chiles sued the state and licensing officials in 2022, arguing that the ban violates her First Amendment rights by censoring her speech based on viewpoint and the content of her conversations. She sought to block Colorado from enforcing it against her.",
      "Colorado officials, meanwhile, argued that its law regulates professional health care treatment to ensure patients receive quality care. States have for centuries regulated professional health care to protect patients from substandard treatment, they said, and the First Amendment has never forbidden states from doing that.",
      "A federal district court ruled for Colorado, finding that its prohibition regulates professional conduct by forbidding certain speech made in a professional context. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit upheld that decision. The appeals court divided 2-1 in finding that the restriction regulates professional conduct that only incidentally burdens speech.",
      "The use of race in redistricting",
      "On Oct. 15, the Supreme Court will consider for the second time the Louisiana congressional map drawn after the 2020 Census.",
      "But the stakes for the case this time around are much higher: The justices are weighing whether the Constitution allows a state to intentionally create a second majority-minority congressional district to comply with the Voting Rights Act.",
      "\"The outcome of the case will not only determine the next steps for Louisiana's congressional map but may also shape the future of redistricting cases nationwide and forecast the resiliency of our nation's democratic values,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, told reporters during a call.",
      "The long-running dispute involves the interplay between Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law. In this case, state lawmakers drew a second majority-Black congressional district to address a Section 2 violation, but bumped up against the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits racial gerrymandering.",
      "The case dates back to the first congressional map drawn by Louisiana Republicans and enacted in 2022, which consisted of one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts. African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "A district judge ruled that map likely violated Section 2 because it deprived minority voters of the chance to elect their preferred candidate. So Louisiana state lawmakers went back to the drawing board and crafted a new map that contained a second majority-minority district.",
      "Republicans said the re-drawn districts brought the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act and protected key GOP incumbents in the U.S. House, namely House Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Julia Letlow, who sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee.",
      "But a group of 12 self-described \"non-African-Americans\" challenged that new map as a racial gerrymander in violation of the 14th Amendment, and a three-judge panel of district judges agreed. It found that race predominated in drawing the new voting boundaries.",
      "Last March, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether to keep Louisiana's re-crafted map in place. But in June, it ordered further arguments this term and later asked the parties \u2014 Louisiana officials, the 12 non-African-American voters, and a separate group of Black Louisianans \u2014 to address whether Louisiana's intentional creation of the second majority-minority House district violates the 14th or 15th Amendments.",
      "While Louisiana officials first defended the re-shaped House district lines, they now say the creation of the second majority-Black district in its new voting map violates the Constitution.",
      "The Supreme Court has typically given map-drawers breathing room to navigate the requirements of Section 2 and the 14th Amendment, but the Louisiana case could lead to a weakening of Section 2.",
      "In a 2023 decision that upheld the constitutionality of Section 2 as applied to redistricting, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that there should be an end to the drawing of voting boundaries based on race at some point. In a concurring opinion, he wrote \"the authority to conduct race-based redistricting cannot extend indefinitely into the future.\"",
      "Trump's sweeping tariffs",
      "Mr. Trump announced earlier this year that he would be imposing sweeping baseline tariffs on imports from nearly every U.S. trading partner, to address \"chronic trade deficits\" that he said \"are no longer merely an economic \u2014 they're a national emergency.\" He also imposed levies on products from Canada, Mexico and China because of what he said was their failure to stop illicit drugs from flowing into the U.S.",
      "The president used a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to implement the tariffs. That law gives the president the authority to declare a national emergency to deal with \"any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to the national security, foreign policy or economy of the United States. Once the president declares a national emergency, IEEPA gives the president the authority to take certain actions, including to regulate importation.",
      "Mr. Trump declared national emergencies related to trade deficits and drug trafficking, and imposed the tariffs under IEEPA to address them.",
      "A group of 12 states and small businesses filed lawsuits challenging Mr. Trump's tariffs, arguing that IEEPA did not give the president the authority to impose his global levies. A federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that Mr. Trump's tariffs are illegal. A federal district court in Washington, D.C., also reached the same conclusion.",
      "The Trump administration appealed to the Supreme Court, and it agreed to hear the cases on an expedited basis.",
      "The high court has in the past been skeptical of broad presidential authority when it involves what are known in administrative law as \"major questions\" of vast economic and political significance, like when it invalidated former President Joe Biden's student loan forgiveness plan. But the Trump administration has argued that this delegation of power involves foreign affairs and national security, and his determination that tariffs are best suited to address trade-deficit and drug-trafficking emergencies warrant deference.",
      "Martinez predicted the debate in the case will be about textualism and how to look at the language in IEEPA, as well as principles like the major questions doctrine, deference and nondelegation that have been embraced by the Supreme Court's conservative majority.",
      "\"These are all the same kinds of arguments that the conservative side of the court has been pushing very strongly in recent years to limit the use and some would say abuse of executive branch authority,\" Martinez, who clerked for Chief Justice John Roberts, said during an event hosted by Georgetown Law. \"It will be interesting to see how those same principles are applied in this context, where you have a Republican president with a major policy initiative.\"",
      "Campaign finance",
      "The Supreme Court has in a string of recent decisions unraveled campaign finance limits as violations of the First Amendment, which has allowed more money to flow into politics. The latest campaign finance dispute before the justices could follow that trend.",
      "At issue in the case is a 50-year-old provision of campaign finance law that restricts the amount of money political parties can spend in coordination with their candidates during a campaign. For 2024, the limits on coordinated spending by party committees were from $123,600 to $3.7 million for Senate candidates, and between $61,800 and $123,600 for House candidates.",
      "In 2022, two GOP campaign committees, along with then-Senate candidate JD Vance and then-Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio argued these limits were unconstitutional.",
      "A federal appeals court upheld the limits under a 2001 Supreme Court decision that rejected a challenge to an earlier version of the restrictions. But since that ruling 24 years ago, the makeup of the high court has changed significantly and now has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "Republicans appealed the lower court decision to the Supreme Court and urged it to strike down the limits on coordinated spending as a violation of the First Amendment.",
      "State laws targeting transgender athletes",
      "On the heels of its June decision upholding a Tennessee law banning certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court said it would decide whether states can prohibit transgender athletes from participating in girls' and women's sports.",
      "The justices will be looking at laws from Idaho and West Virginia to determine whether they violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and, in the case involving West Virginia, Title IX. Idaho was the first state to ban transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports, and roughly two dozen have enacted similar laws.",
      "Mr. Trump also signed an executive order in February that aimed to keep transgender girls and women from competing on teams that match their gender identity.",
      "The Idaho case was brought by Lindsay Hecox, a transgender woman who attended Boise State University and wanted to try out for the women's track and cross-country teams as a sophomore. She has been treated for gender dysphoria for several years, including receiving testosterone suppression and estrogen.",
      "A U.S. district court blocked enforcement of Idaho's law, finding the ban discriminates against transgender women. A federal appeals court upheld the injunction as applied to Hecox.",
      "Months after the Supreme Court agreed to take up the case, Hecox decided to dismiss her lawsuit for personal reasons and because of \"negative public scrutiny from certain quarters.\" Her lawyers have asked the Supreme Court to toss out the appeals court's decision and order the case to be dismissed.",
      "The West Virginia case involves Becky Pepper-Jackson, who receives puberty-delaying treatment and estrogen hormone therapy and wanted to participate in girls' athletics in middle school. A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the ban only against Pepper-Jackson, ruling it likely violates Title IX and the Constitution.",
      "But in 2023, the judge sided with the state and upheld the law, finding that the state can legislate sports rules because sex and the physical characteristics that flow from it are related to athletic performance and fairness in sports.",
      "A federal appeals court ruled in 2024, though, that the West Virginia law violated Title IX by discriminating against Pepper-Jackson on the basis of sex.",
      "Trump's power to fire executive officers",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has sought to overhaul the executive branch, including by firing Democratic-appointed officials at independent agencies without cause. He has removed those officers despite federal laws shielding them from being terminated unless for inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.",
      "Lower courts have repeatedly sided with the fired officials and ordered them to be reinstated. But the Supreme Court has allowed Mr. Trump to fire members of the Merit Systems Protection Board, National Labor Relations Board and Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "After allowing those other firings, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether for-cause removal protections violate the separation of powers. It will also decide whether Mr. Trump can remove Lisa Cook from her position on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.",
      "\"These are cases that raise really profound questions about presidential power \u2026 about Congress' ability to design institutions of government and to insulate certain important functions from the political whims of the day, whether it be setting interest rates or deciding labor relations or nuclear safety,\" lawyer Deepak Gupta told reporters at the Georgetown Law event. Gupta represents Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired from her position as a member of the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "One of the disputes before the high court, which has not yet been scheduled for argument, involves Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, who Mr. Trump removed from her post at the Federal Trade Commission. A district court ruled the president violated a 1914 law that limits the grounds for removing a FTC commissioner to instances of inefficiency, neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.",
      "When the case landed before the Supreme Court in an emergency posture, it allowed Mr. Trump to oust Slaughter, and the high court said it would decide the constitutionality of removal protections for the FTC.",
      "The case puts in the Supreme Court's crosshairs a 1935 decision that allowed Congress to enact removal restrictions for officials at certain independent agencies, which the high court has chipped away at in recent years.",
      "The second case, involving Cook, will be argued in January. Mr. Trump attempted to fire Cook from the Fed board after an administration official accused her of mortgage fraud. The effort to remove her is unprecedented, as no president has attempted to fire a sitting Fed governor in the central bank's 112-year-history.",
      "Cook has denied any wrongdoing, and she has not been charged with any criminal offense. A federal judge ruled in September that Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook likely violated federal law because he did not state a legally permissible cause for her termination.",
      "The judge also said Cook's due process rights were likely violated because she did not receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before she was ousted.",
      "A federal appeals court rejected a request from the Trump administration to allow the president to fire Cook and agreed with the lower court that Cook did not receive adequate process before her attempted removal. The two-judge majority did not address whether Mr. Trump satisfied the \"for cause\" removal requirement.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump asked the justices to let him remove Cook from the Fed Board while the challenge to her firing moved forward. But the high court declined to immediately rule on his request for relief, and instead said it will hear arguments in January.",
      "By putting off a decision, the Supreme Court let Cook remain a Fed governor while it considers the issue.",
      "Gun rights",
      "Just before the start of the new term, the Supreme Court said it will decide whether Hawaii can stop people with concealed-carry permits from bringing their handguns onto private property that is open to the public, unless they receive \"express authorization\" from the property owner.",
      "The case involves firearms restrictions enacted in Hawaii in 2023, on the heels of the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling that expanded gun rights. The measure prohibits people with concealed-carry permits from carrying handguns on different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",
      "The restriction at issue in the case before the Supreme Court bars people with concealed-carry licenses from bringing handguns onto private property unless they receive permission from the property owner. Four other states \u2014 California, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York \u2014 have similar laws that require a property owner's approval before carrying firearms on private property, such as by posting signs stating that guns are allowed.",
      "The Hawaii Firearms Coalition and three gun owners with concealed-carry permits challenged the law in June 2023, and a federal appeals court ultimately upheld the provision related to private property.",
      "Lawyers for the gun owners argued that the 9th Circuit effectively found that the Second Amendment does not apply to private property open to the public, rendering \"illusory the right to carry in public.\" The Trump administration had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to take up the dispute, warning that because few property owners post signs allowing or prohibiting guns, Hawaii's restriction functioned as a \"near-complete ban on public carry.\"",
      "Hawaii officials, meanwhile, said the rule regarding private property \"represents a permissible effort to vindicate the rights of Hawaii's citizens.\" They argued that under its law, a person who wants to bring a gun into a store can simply ask for oral permission.",
      "Since its June 2022 decision recognizing the Second Amendment's right to bear arms extends to outside the home, the Supreme Court has been asked to decide the constitutionality of a number of longstanding firearms restrictions and state laws. Last year, the high court upheld a federal law prohibiting people subject to a domestic violence restraining order from having firearms.",
      "But it has also declined to take up challenges to state bans on assault weapons and other federal measures.",

    "story": [
      "A popular Alaskan climber fell to his death from Yosemite National Park's El Capitan, marking the third death in the park this summer.",
      "Balin Miller, 23, died in a climbing accident Wednesday, his mother Jeanine Girard-Moorman confirmed.",
      "\"He's been climbing since he was a young boy,\" she said. \"His heart and soul was truly to just climb. He loved to climb and it was never about money and fame.\"",
      "The death comes on the first day of the federal government shutdown, which left national parks \"generally\" open, with limited operations and closed visitors centers, according to the National Park Service. The park service said in a statement that they are investigating the incident and \"park rangers and emergency personnel responded immediately.\"",
      "El Capitan is one of the most striking features of Yosemite National Park, an enormous sheer granite rock face of approximately 3,000 feet (915 meters) that entices big-wall rock climbers from all over the world. Alex Honnold completed the first free solo climb of El Capitan in 2017 for the documentary \"Free Solo.\"",
      "Many posted tributes to Miller on social media, saying they had watched him climb on a TikTok livestream for two days before his death and referring to him as \"orange tent guy\" because of his distinctive camp setup.",
      "Earlier this year, an 18-year-old from Texas died in the park while free-soloing, or climbing without a rope, on a different formation. In August, a 29-year-old woman died after being struck in the head by a large tree branch while hiking.",
      "While it's still unclear exactly what happened, his older brother, Dylan Miller, said Balin was lead rope soloing \u2014 a way to climb alone while still protected by a rope \u2014 on a 2,400-foot (730-meter) route named Sea of Dreams. He had already finished the climb and was hauling up his last bit of gear when he likely rappelled off the end of his rope, Dylan said.",
      "Miller was an accomplished alpinist who had already gained international attention for claiming the first solo ascent of Mount McKinley's Slovak Direct, a technically difficult route that took him 56 hours to complete, he posted on his Instagram in June.",
      "He grew up climbing in Alaska with his brother and their father, who was also a climber. While Dylan took a little more time to fall in love with the sport, it stuck with his younger sibling instantly.",
      "\"He said he felt most alive when he was climbing,\" Dylan Miller said. \"I'm his bigger brother but he was my mentor.\"",
      "This year, Balin Miller had also spent weeks solo climbing in Patagonia and the Canadian Rockies, ticking off a notoriously difficult ice climb called Reality Bath, which had been unrepeated for 37 years, according to Climbing magazine.",
      "\"He's had probably one of the most impressive last six months of climbing of anyone that I can think of,\" Clint Helander, an Alaska alpinist, told the Anchorage Daily News.",
      "But this most recent trip to Yosemite wasn't supposed to be hard climbing. Miller had just arrived two weeks early to climb and enjoy the park's beauty and solitude before the rest of his family, who planned to meet up there.",
      "More than just a climber, he loved animals and was fun, kind and full of life, his mother said.",
      "He often climbed with a stripe of glitter freckles across his cheekbones, describing it in a Climbing magazine interview like \"a warrior putting makeup on before going into battle.\"",
      "\"He has inspired so many people to do things that are perhaps unthinkable, including myself. I can't imagine climbing ever again without him,\" his brother said.",

    "story": [
      "Detective Devin Rigo knew the clock was ticking as he raced to a metal scrapyard just north of Portland, Oregon. Rigo, with the Hillsboro Police Department, had just learned about the discovery of a maroon minivan he believed contained evidence connected to the murder of 56-year-old Kenneth \"Kenny\" Fandrich, a contract pipe fitter.",
      "On Jan. 27, 2023, Kenny Fandrich was discovered in a parking garage at the Intel campus in Hillsboro. Police reviewed surveillance camera images and determined that Fandrich had been dragged into the minivan by a masked man. Police believed the killer had broken Fandrich's neck and killed him inside the minivan, before staging his body back in the driver's seat of his own vehicle.",
      "From evidence found at the scene, investigators believed the murder suspect tried to cover his crime by spray-painting multiple security cameras in the parking garage with blue spray paint. Correspondent Natalie Morales covers the investigation into Kenny Fandrich's murder and the hunt for the killer in \"Murder in the Parking Garage,\" an all-new \"48 Hours\" airing Saturday, Oct. 4, at 10 p.m. ET/9 p.m. CT on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Soon after police arrived on the scene, Intel security personnel provided investigators with recordings from their hundreds of security cameras in the parking garage. Police soon had images of a suspect \u2013 wearing a hard hat, tinted glasses and a face mask \u2013 spray-painting the security cameras around Fandrich's car early that morning, to apparently conceal the crime. At the time, the suspect had not been detected by Intel. But when police looked at the footage, they discovered that the spray paint didn't cover everything the cameras recorded.",
      "Police believed that whoever had killed Fandrich waited for him inside that minivan, then attacked Fandrich when he returned to his car after his shift. The killer left the garage in the maroon minivan soon after.",
      "The night that Fandrich's body was found, his wife, Tanya Fandrich, told investigators Kenny had a stalker: a well-off former veterinarian named Dr. Steven Milner. Tanya Fandrich had worked for Milner at his vet clinic for years, and they had an affair, which Tanya Fandrich said was long over. Police found that Kenny Fandrich had filed several orders for protection against Milner, and that Milner had been warned by Hillsboro police officers to stop following Kenny Fandrich. Just months before Kenny Fandrich's murder, Milner had been caught placing a tracking device on one of the Fandrichs' vehicles and was criminally charged. After several days of investigation, police arrested Milner and charged him with the murder of Kenny Fandrich.",
      "Once in custody, police were able to connect the minivan, and another vehicle, to Milner, who had left them at a Home Depot parking lot for long periods of time.",
      "To prove the case against Milner, investigators felt they had to find that minivan. \"Because it's the minivan that we believe was really our main crime scene \u2026\" said Rigo. \"We thought there was going to be forensic evidence \u2026 in that minivan.\"",
      "Rigo and his partner, Detective Stephanie Winter, called the vehicles \"burner cars.\"",
      "\"Everybody kind of is more familiar with like a burner phone \u2026\" said Rigo, \"where you have a phone that's not \u2026 traced to you but, you know, you can use it for what you need, get rid of it \u2026 Essentially, he did the same thing, but with a car.\"",
      "The maroon minivan had been flagged at the Home Depot parking lot and the VIN number had been recorded. Security footage showed the van leaving the Home Depot parking lot shortly before Fandrich was murdered.",
      "\"We are sending flyers to every agency in the area,\" said Rigo about the minivan's VIN number.",
      "The first alert they got was from the Oregon Department of Transportation. The minivan had been towed off the side of the busy I-5 highway in North Portland just days after Fandrich was murdered. Detectives believe it had been dumped there by Milner. Rigo called the tow company and found out the minivan had been sold to a scrap metal company. That's when he started racing to the scrapyard to see if they could retrieve the minivan, and the key crime scene evidence it may have held. But he was too late. When Rigo arrived and asked about the minivan, he was shown a video of the crime scene being picked up and smashed to pieces. \"I was able to watch one of my key pieces of evidence be crushed and taken away,\" said Rigo, \"before my very eyes \u2026 exactly a week too late.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Friday that it will decide whether Hawaii can bar people with concealed carry permits from bringing handguns on private property that is open to the public unless they receive permission from the property owner.",
      "The high court said it will review a decision by a federal appeals court that upheld Hawaii's firearms restriction. In agreeing to take up the dispute, it adds gun rights to a term already loaded with hot-button issues, including race-based redistricting, state laws targeting transgender athletes and campaign finance, as well as several cases involving President Trump.",
      "The legal battle is the latest involving gun regulations to arrive at the Supreme Court since it expanded Second Amendment rights in 2022 with a decision that set a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of firearms restrictions. This case appears to be the first that the Supreme Court will hear since its ruling that involves the places where guns can be carried.",
      "Since that 2022 decision, the high court has declined to take up challenges to state assault-weapons bans, as well as others involving longstanding federal laws restricting who can have guns. Last year, however, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that prohibits people who are subject to domestic violence restraining orders from having firearms.",
      "The legal battle now before the high court arose after Hawaii passed legislation in 2023 that responded to the Supreme Court's 2022 decision in the case known as New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. The measure prohibits a person with a concealed carry permit from bringing a handgun onto different types of property, including beaches, playgrounds, bars and restaurants that serve liquor, and other \"sensitive\" locations.",

      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that in Hawaii, a person who carries a handgun for self-defense cannot run errands without the risk of running afoul of the law. He said that the restriction aims only to impede the exercise of Second Amendment rights.",

Butler wrote that 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, who police have identified as the shooter, is leaving \"behind a wife and children who must be grieving,\" and that \"one of the Sanford sons deals with serious medical challenges that require ongoing care, treatment, and specialized support.\"",
      "The\u00a0deadly church attack in Grand Blanc, Michigan\u00a0killed four people and left at least eight others injured. Sanford drove his pickup truck through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and opened fire with an assault-style rifle\u00a0at around 100 churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said. Officials say he then set the church building on fire.",

      "\"His lawyers tried to fight his removal from the U.S. but one thing is certain, this Salvadoran man is not going to be able to remain in our country. He will never be allowed to prey on innocent Americans again,\" the department said in a post to social media.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, had been living in Maryland for more than a decade with his wife and children when he was first taken into federal immigration custody in March and deported to El Salvador. But an immigration judge in 2019 had granted Abrego Garcia a withholding of removal, a legal status that prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from removing him to his home country because of likely persecution by local gangs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., though the Department of Homeland Security resisted doing so for weeks. But in early June, Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. after a federal grand jury indicted him on two counts of human smuggling.",
      "He pleaded not guilty to both counts, and in July, a federal judge overseeing his criminal case ordered him to be released on bond while awaiting trial. But he remained detained for several weeks because of concerns that Abrego Garcia would be swiftly taken into immigration custody following his release and deported.",
      "Abrego Garcia left criminal confinement in late August, but was arrested by immigration authorities days later when he went for an interview with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore. He filed a petition challenging the legality of his arrest and detention, and a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the Trump administration from removing Abrego Garcia from the U.S.",
      "He had been held at a detention center in Virginia but was transferred to a facility in Pennsylvania last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia applied for asylum in 2019, but an immigration judge said he waited too long to do so and denied the bid. Under federal immigration law, an asylum-seeker has to file an application within one year of their arrival to the U.S. The immigration judge said in the 2019 decision that Abrego Garcia waited seven years to file a request for asylum.",
      "But the judge, David Jones, said Abrego Garica provided \"credible responses\" to questions and provided \"substantial documentation\" bolstering his claim for asylum, including affidavits from family members describing threats by a local gang.",

      "Many Americans are eager to put money away for retirement, but that goal is increasingly out of reach because more workers are living paycheck to paycheck, a new Goldman Sachs study finds.",
      "Roughly 42% of younger working Americans \u2014 spanning Gen Z, millennials and Gen X \u2014 report having no spare savings after covering their basic living expenses, according to the analysis, which surveyed about 3,600 workers and 1,500 retirees. Among those just getting by, about three-quarters said they are struggling to save for retirement, the survey found.",
      "The share of U.S. workers in this precarious financial position has grown significantly since 1997, when 31% lived paycheck to paycheck, according to Goldman. The investment bank projects that figure could climb to well over half of Americans by 2033 as essentials like housing and health care continue to rise in cost.",
      "\"Save more\" ignores reality",
      "The findings underscore the challenges millions of Americans now face just making ends meets while also managing to set aside money for retirement, a financial pinch that Goldman Sachs calls a \"financial vortex.\" That money crunch helps explains why more than a quarter of older Americans are nearing retirement without anything saved \u2014 a gap that could widen given the financial pressures facing younger workers.",
      "\"These findings force us to ask a very critical question: Does the retirement math still work? The answer is no,\" said Greg Wilson, head of retirement at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in a conference call to discuss the report. \"Telling workers just to 'save more' ignores the realities they face.\"",
      "Skipping a latte or avocado toast isn't likely to make much of a dent in the financial dynamics facing workers today, with Goldman finding that basic expenses are consuming an ever growing share of people's after-tax income.",
      "For instance, homeownership now eats up 51% of income, up from 33% in 2000, while health care costs account for 16% of after-tax earnings, up from 10% a quarter century ago, the analysis found.",
      "\"The mounting challenges American workers face ... make it harder than ever to save for retirement,\" Wilson said.",
      "Such financial pressures come as many Americans are on their own to plan, and save for, their retirement, largely because of the shift in the 1980s from company-sponsored pensions to 401(k) plans.",
      "As a savings vehicle, 401(k) shifts the burden onto workers, who must decide how much to save, how to invest and how to draw down their money in retirement \u2014 a do-it-yourself approach that retirement experts such as Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at The New School for Social Research in New York,\u00a0describe as inadequate.",
      "Hoping for a miracle",
      "Financial professionals say it's no coincidence that members of Generation X, which entered the workforce just as the shift to 401(k)s became mainstream, is feeling unprepared as they get closer to retirement. Now 45 to 60 years old, almost half said they believed it would take a \"miracle\" for them to be able to retire, a Natixis study found last year.",
      "Goldman acknowledged that it can be difficult to close a retirement funding gap with savings alone, but noted that some strategies could help. Some approaches may be out of reach for older workers, like Gen X and millennials, but could be of use for their children \u2014 for instance, setting aside $500 a year from ages 1 to 20, a move Goldman found could increase retirement savings by 14%.",
      "Adding private market investments to a portfolio could also help boost retirement savings by 14% through higher returns, according to Goldman. Those strategies might become more accessible for workers under a Trump administration plan to open up 401(k)\u00a0plans to private equity, cryptocurrencies and other alternative investments.",
      "Lastly, if possible, workers should take advantage of benefits from their employers such as funding an emergency savings account, which can help them avoid raiding their 401(k) in case of an unexpected expense, such as medical bills, the bank notes.",
      "Even so, while those approaches might work for workers with access to employer-sponsored retirement plans, about half of all U.S. private-sector workers\u00a0lack access to such programs, an analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts found earlier this year. Although it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to an employer retirement plan said they struggled to build wealth, the Pew survey found.",

      "The demands are outlined in a nine-page document, title the \"Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education,\" that asks schools to freeze their tuition rate for five years, ban the use of sex and gender as factors in their admissions process, and cap their international student numbers, among other requirements.",
      "Signatories also must commit to \"transforming or abolishing institutional units that purposefully punish, belittle and even spark violence against conservative ideas,\" according to the memo.",

      "The official declined to say whether the Trump administration plans to make a similar offer to other colleges.",
      "The agreement was\u00a0first reported\u00a0by the Wall Street Journal. May Mailman, a senior adviser for special projects at the White House, told the paper that the Trump administration doesn't plan to limit funding only to institutions that agree to abide by the compact. However, schools that sign the agreement will be granted priority in receiving federal funding and engaging with White House officials.",
      "\"Institutions of higher education are free to develop models and values other than those below, if the institution elects to forego federal benefits,\" the agreement states.",

      "In a\u00a0statement\u00a0on Thursday, the University of Pennsylvania chapter of the American Association of University Professors said the White House letter amounts to a threat.",
      "\"Penn must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding its self-determination,\" the group said. \"Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university.\"",
      "The agreement places a cap on foreign student enrollment, which it states cannot exceed 15% of a university's undergraduate population. Also, no more than 5% of foreign students enrolled at a college can come from a single country.",
      "\"Universities that rely on foreign students to fund their institutions risk, among other things, potentially reducing spots available to deserving American students,\" the document states.",
      "The nine schools are also asked to freeze tuition for five years and to waive tuition for students pursuing \"hard science programs\" at institutions where the endowment exceeds $2 million per undergraduate student. Schools would not have to freeze tuition for students from \"families of exceptional means,\" under the agreement.",
      "The letter represents the latest attempt by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's higher education system. The administration has targeted high-profile universities in recent months, threatening to pull federal funding if they do not agree to certain concessions on combating antisemitism and changing their diversity practices.",
      "Columbia University in July agreed to pay the administration $200 million to resolve an investigation into alleged violations of anti-discrimination laws. The Trump administration earlier this year also suspended roughly $2 billion in federal funding earmarked for Harvard University over what the White House said was the school's failure to crack down on antisemitism on its campus.

    "story": [
      "President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.",
      "\"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions.\"",
      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro said. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of \"any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\" The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

Sarah Mullally was appointed as the 106th archbishop of Canterbury on Friday, the U.K. government announced, which will soon formally make her the spiritual leader of over 85 million people who practice the Anglican faith globally.",
      "Mullally, who is a former nurse in Britain's National Health Service, will officially become the archbishop at a ceremony in London at St. Paul's Cathedral in January. For the past seven years, Mullally has served as the bishop of London, where she was also the first woman to hold that position. She had previously been the most senior U.K. government adviser on nursing as the government's chief nursing officer for England, and was the youngest person ever to be appointed to that post.",

      "Regent Sound studio, which The Who's Pete Townshend once described as a \"massive part of rock history,\" had been silent for decades. Now, it's being revived as both a landmark site filled with rock, jazz, and blues memorabilia, and a newly refurbished guitar store.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Two Jewish men were killed and three other men were seriously injured in a terror attack outside a synagogue in the northern English city of\u00a0Manchester\u00a0on Thursday, authorities said. The vehicle and\u00a0stabbing\u00a0attack, which ended within minutes when police killed the attacker, comes as Jewish people around the world mark the holiday of Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish religious calendar.",
      "\"A vile individual committed a terrorist attack that attacked Jews because they are Jews and attacked Britain because of our values,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday evening local time. Starmer, who flew back to the U.K. early from a meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to address the rampage, called the attack a \"horrific incident\" and said there would be a \"more visible police presence\" to protect Jewish communities across the country.",
      "Investigators believe the attacker was 35-year-old Jihad Al-Shamie, a British citizen of Syrian descent, Manchester police said\u00a0in a statement, noting that formal identification had yet to take place.",
      "\"We are working to understand the motivation behind the attack as the investigation continues,\" police said in the statement.",
      "Police also arrested two men in their 30s and a woman in her 60s on suspicion of commission, preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism. No other details were immediately released about them.",
      "Police said the attacker was shot by firearms officers and later died. The attacker wore a vest that looked like it contained an explosive device, Greater Manchester Police Chief Constable Stephen Watson told reporters. Police later said the device was deemed to be not viable. A bomb disposal unit was deployed to the scene. Police said there was a loud noise as investigators gained entry to the attacker's vehicle, but that there was no risk to the public.",
      "Earlier, Watson had described the two deceased victims as members of the area's Jewish community, but he didn't identify them. Police later said all the victims were men. One of the injured victims was stabbed, another was hit by the attacker's car, and a third may have been hurt as police stopped the attacker, police said.",
      "\"I'm Jewish and absolutely terrified,\" Vicky, who lives near the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Manchester and didn't want to provide her last name, told the Reuters news agency. \"It's just absolutely frightening because I'm scared for my own safety and my mom's safety.\"",
      "Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the government increased security at synagogues across the country.",
      "\"We will do whatever is required to keep our Jewish community safe,\" Mahmood told reporters in Manchester. \"To those who seek to divide us, they will fail.\"",
      "The attacker drove directly at people outside the synagogue and then attacked people with a knife, Watson said. The attack happened while a large group of worshippers was inside the synagogue.",
      "\"Thanks to the immediate bravery of security staff and the worshippers inside as well as the fast response of the police, the attacker was prevented from gaining access,\" Watson said.",
      "The worshippers inside the synagogue were safe, he said.",
      "\"Today we have witnessed a vile attack on our Jewish community on its holiest day,\" Andy Burnham, mayor of Greater Manchester, said in a statement. \"We condemn whoever is responsible and will do everything within our power to keep people safe. We stand with GM's [Greater Manchester's] Jewish community at this time and will work through the day to support them.\"",
      "Police said officers were called to the synagogue at about 9.30 a.m. local time (4:30 a.m. ET) by a member of the public who said he'd witnessed a car being driven toward members of the public.",
      "\"Shots were fired by Greater Manchester Police firearms officers at 9:38 a.m.,\" just minutes after the incident was reported, police said. \"One man has been shot, believed to be the offender.\"",
      "London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the capital city's Metropolitan Police Service would be \"stepping up high-visibility policing in and around synagogues in London.\"",
      "\"I know, as it is, Jewish people have been scared and feeling scared over the last few months, indeed, since October the 7th, 2023,\" Khan said. \"I also know many want to go to the synagogue and worship. I want to reassure them that in London, they will be seeing additional police officers. People should be allowed to go about and practice their faith knowing they're going to be safe. Unfortunately, too many Jewish Londoners, Jewish people across the country, Jewish people across the globe, don't feel that way. And that's heartbreaking.\"",
      "King Charles III said in a statement that he and Queen Camilla were \"deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the horrific attack in Manchester, especially on such a significant day for the Jewish community. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected by this appalling incident and we greatly appreciate the swift actions of the emergency services.\"",

    "story": [
      "Researchers from Purdue University are set to travel to the South Pacific to determine if a \"visual anomaly\" on a remote island is the wreck of Amelia Earhart's lost plane, saying there is \"very strong\" evidence the object is the iconic aviator's aircraft.",
      "Earhart was attempting to become the first female pilot to circle the world when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared over the Pacific Ocean on July 2, 1937. Earhart, Noonan and their plane, an Electra 10E, were never found. Recently, President Trump ordered records related to Earhart be declassified.",
      "In 2020, researchers looking at satellite imagery identified a \"visual anomaly\" known as the Taraia Object in a lagoon on Nikumaroro, a small island in Kiribati about halfway between Australia and Hawaii, according to a news release from Purdue University. Nikumaroro is about 400 miles southeast of Howland Island, Earhart and Noonan's planned destination.",
      "The underwater object has been visible in photos dating back to 1938, the year after Earhart and Noonan disappeared.",
      "A team of researchers from Purdue University, the Purdue Research Foundation and the Archaeological Legacy Institute will travel to Nikumaroro to inspect the object in November. The team will first take photos and videos of the site, then use magnetometers and sonar devices to scan the area. Then, the item will be dredged and lifted from the water so researchers can attempt to identify it.",
      "A mystery 88 years in the making! \ud83d\udd0ePurdue joins the Archaeological Legacy Institute in a South Pacific expedition to search for Amelia Earhart\u2019s missing Lockheed Electra airplane. https://t.co/WqEEWi6XwA",
      "Theories have abounded about Earhart and Noonan's fates since their disappearance. One theory suggests that Earhart landed on Nikumaroro and was marooned on the island before her death. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, a nonprofit organization based in Pennsylvania, has\u00a0collected evidence\u00a0it says supports the theory. Richard Pettigrew, the executive director of the Archaeological Legacy Institute, said that the expedition offers a chance to find \"smoking-gun proof\" that confirms the theory.",
      "''We gathered up many more satellite images, did historical research, found other imagery that relates to it,\" Pettrigrew said. \"We're going to go look and identify it. And if we're right, we'll in fact identify the lost Electra. We could be wrong but I think the evidence is very, very strong that this is, in fact what it is.''",
      "However, Ric Gillespie, executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, has expressed skepticism. \"We've looked there in that spot, and there's nothing there,\" he told NBC News in July.",
      "Steve Schultz, a Purdue senior vice president and the university's general counsel, will be a field assistant on the expedition. He said that if the object is identified as Earhart's plane, the university hopes it can transport the plane home. Earhart worked at Purdue University for two years in the 1930s, and the Purdue Research Foundation originally paid for the airplane that Earhart flew, the school said. She planned to return the craft to the university after her trip around the world.",
      "\"A successful identification would be the first step toward fulfilling Amelia's original plan to return the Electra to West Lafayette after her historic flight,\" Schultz said in the news release.",
      "Last year, an expedition team captured a sonar image in the Pacific Ocean that appeared to resemble Earhart's plane resting at the bottom of the sea. It turned out\u00a0 to be a rock formation.",

    "story": [
      "Jerusalem\u00a0\u2014 Israeli navy forces boarded most of the vessels and detained dozens of activists and a number of European lawmakers aboard a flotilla attempting to break Israel's blockade of Gaza on Thursday, drawing condemnation from around the world. The organizers of the Global Sumud Flotilla said one boat had managed to sail on but stopped near Gaza's coast on Thursday morning before contact with the vessel was lost.",
      "The flotilla organizers said 39 of their boats were intercepted \u2014 or assumed intercepted as communication with the activists was lost \u2014 in an Israeli operation that began the night before. Israel's foreign ministry said the activists from the boats, including Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg, were safe and being transferred to Israel.",
      "In a social media post, the foreign ministry said the activists and their boats were \"making their way safely and peacefully to Israel, where their deportation procedures to Europe will begin. The passengers are safe and in good health.\"",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla, composed of nearly 50 boats and 500 activists, was trying to carry a symbolic amount of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The group, which includes Nelson Mandela's grandson, Mandla Mandela, former Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau and several European lawmakers, said earlier that it remained undeterred in its mission to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza and bring aid to Palestinians.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American military veteran aboard the Ohwayla, one of the boats in the flotilla, said that around a dozen Israeli naval vessels with their transponders off had approached it early Thursday.",
      "\"They are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\" he said in a shaky video posted on Instagram. Israeli authorities used water cannons against some of the boats, Stoker and other activists reported on social media.",
      "The Israeli Foreign Ministry posted a video on X showing Thunberg sitting on a ship's deck being handed a water bottle and raincoat.",
      "Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told Italian TV network RAI that the boats would be towed to Israel's port of Ashdod and the activists would be deported in the coming days. He also said Israeli forces have been told \"not to use violence.\"",
      "Some of the flotilla's vessels came under attack by drones while docked off Tunisia, and then later while sailing near Greece. The drone strikes sparked fires on two of the boats in Tunisian waters, according to the flotilla organizers, and Tunisian authorities confirmed they were investigating at least one attack as a \"deliberate act.\"",
      "Neither Tunisia nor Greece has accused anyone of being responsible for the drone attacks.",
      "The Israeli military never responded to CBS News requests for comment on the incidents.",
      "Israel draws condemnation for intercepting Gaza flotilla",
      "Turkey's Foreign Ministry condemned Israel's interception of the boats denouncing it as an \"act of terrorism\" and severe breach of international law. In a statement, the ministry said it was taking initiatives to ensure the immediate release of Turkish citizens and other passengers detained by the Israeli forces.",
      "Colombia President Gustavo Petro said late Wednesday he would expel Israel's diplomatic delegation in the South American country if the Israeli military intercepted the flotilla. He said he will also terminate his country's free trade agreement with Israel.",
      "Petro has repeatedly described Israel's siege of Gaza as genocide. He broke diplomatic ties with Israel in May 2024 over the Israel-Hamas war, prompting the departure of Ambassador Gali Dagan, but an unspecified number of consular services staff remain in Colombia.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim also condemned the interception of the flotilla, saying Israeli forces had detained eight Malaysians.",
      "\"By blocking a humanitarian mission, Israel has shown utter contempt not only for the rights of the Palestinian people but also for the conscience of the world,\" Anwar, whose country is predominantly Muslim, said in a statement, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "European governments, including Spain and Italy, which had sent their navy ships to escort the flotilla during part of its journey, urged the activists to turn back and avoid confrontation. But while Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni said late Tuesday the flotilla's actions risked undermining President Trump's recent proposal for resolving the war in Gaza, Spain's prime minister defended them.",
      "\"We must remember it is a humanitarian mission that wouldn't be taking place if the Israeli government had allowed for the entry of aid,\" Pedro S\u00e1nchez told reporters on Wednesday. Spaniards taking part would benefit from full diplomatic protection, he added.",
      "\"They present no threat nor danger to Israel,\" he said.",
      "Spain's government summoned the top Israeli diplomat in the country for discussions about the interceptions on Thursday.",
      "\"We are very concerned about the situation with the Sumud flotilla, we are in touch with the families of a number of British nationals involved,\" Britain's foreign office said in a statement. \"The aid carried by the flotilla should be turned over to humanitarian organizations on the ground to be delivered safely into Gaza.\"",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa confirmed that Mandla Mandela was among those on the vessels, and he denounced their interception as evidence of Israeli violations of international law and demanded the immediate release of all of the flotilla \"abductees.\"",
      "Flotilla boats intercepted as they enter \"danger zone\" approaching Gaza",
      "The vessels were sailing in international waters north of Egypt and had entered what activists and others called a \"danger zone.\" While still in international waters, it is an area where the Israeli navy has stopped other boats attempting to break its blockade in the past and which the flotilla has been warned not to cross.",
      "After a tense encounter with two Israeli military vessels in the early hours of Wednesday, activists had resumed their journey and were broadcasting their voyage on livestreams from several of the boats. Some activists held up messages of solidarity with people in Gaza and chanted \"Free Palestine!\" on camera. Music could be heard playing in the background.",
      "As night fell, they detected via radar several unidentified vessels approaching them and put their life vests on ahead of the Israeli military's imminent arrival. Some activists were able to broadcast the moment Israeli forces approached them live from their smartphones before tossing their devices into the water.",
      "The flotilla, which began its journey from the Spanish port of Barcelona a month ago, was to reach the shores of Gaza by Thursday morning, organizers had said earlier.",
      "Activists had acknowledged that scenario was unlikely and were expecting Israeli authorities to try to stop them at any moment, as they have done in past attempts.",
      "But this flotilla, with dozens of boats, was the largest attempt yet to break the Israeli maritime blockade of the Gaza strip that has been ongoing for 18 years.",
      "The Israeli navy had reached out to the flotilla earlier Wednesday warning them that they were approaching an \"active combat zone\" and asking them to change course, the Israeli foreign ministry said, reiterating its offer to transfer the aid to Gaza through other channels. Israel's Foreign Minister Gideon Saar called the flotilla a provocation.",
      "Israel's government has accused some of the flotilla members of being linked to Hamas, while providing little evidence to support the claim. Activists have strongly rejected the accusations and said Israel was trying to justify potential attacks on them.",
      "The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state only has jurisdiction up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don't have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception to this.",
      "Yuval Shany, an expert on international law at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said that as long as Israel's blockade of Gaza is \"militarily justified\" \u2014 meant to keep out weapons \u2014 and the ship intended to break the siege, Israel can intercept the vessel after prior warning. Whether the blockade is militarily justified and the legality of the blockade is a point of contention.",
      "But the flotilla argues they are a civilian, unarmed group and that the passage of humanitarian aid is guaranteed in international law.",
      "Omer Shatz, an Israeli international law expert who teaches at Sciences Po University in Paris and co-litigated a previous flotilla case before the Israeli supreme court, told The Associated Press that even if the disputed siege of Gaza was considered lawful, \"international law paves a humanitarian road from the high seas to Gaza \u2014 both in international and national waters off Gaza,\" he said.",
      "\"If the basic needs of the population are not provided by the occupying power, there is a right to provide humanitarian aid, albeit under certain conditions,\" Shatz said. Israel, for example, would have a right to board and search the vessels carrying aid to verify its cargo, similarly to what it does with aid trucks crossing into Gaza by land.",

      "\"People were going to the survey and trying to figure out, what is wrong with the survey,\" explained Frank Martela, a philosopher and professor.",
      "Martela, who this year published \"Stop Chasing Happiness: a pessimist's guide to a good life,\" believes the Finns were skeptical because of the way happiness is measured.",
      "\"I guess like one key reason is what they are actually measuring in this World Happiness Report,\" Martela said.",
      "The report ranks a nation's happiness based on one question: On a scale of zero to 10, how close is your life to the best possible life?",
      "\"Which is a different question than, you know, did you experience joy today, or did you smile or laugh today?\" Martela said.",
      "Meaningful happiness, in the case of the Finns, really comes down to contentment, which begs the question, why are Finns so content?",
      "\"The kind of society we have has been able to take care of the citizens relatively well,\" Martela explained.",
      "Oodi, Helsinki's Central Library, is an example. The library defines itself as a \"living meeting place\" offering traditional library services, video gaming spaces, digital studio spaces, 3D-printing services and more, all free and accessible to the public.",
      "\"The idea is to make sure everybody has opportunity to do this kind of thing no matter how much money you yourself have,\" Martela said.",
      "But the higher taxes that drive a socialistic society are worth it for the Finns.",
      "\"There's more of an idea of society here, I think, people accept that if you pay taxes, then you're getting something in return,\" explained Tim Bird, who immigrated to Finland from the U.K. more than 40 years ago.",
      "Bird was also enthralled with how close he was to the outdoors in Finland.",
      "\"This is one of the great things about Helsinki, you're never too far from the natural environment,\" he said.",
      "Another possible explanation for the country's happiness could be its citizens' relationship with temperature. Finland has more saunas per person than the U.S. has passenger cars.",
      "Carita Harju, co-author of \"The Power of Hot and Cold,\" explained that she uses the sauna every day for health benefits as much as the mental ones. After heating up, she takes a dip in the chilly Baltic Sea. The quick temperature changes release endorphins, but for Harju, it's about relaxation.",
      "Which brings back around what happiness really means for Finnish people, and why the country has dominated World Happiness charts for nearly a decade.",
      "\"I guess, like we have been given this unique life to live, and it would be like quite sad if you only followed external pressures on doing things that other people want,\" Martela said, \"like living somebody else's dream instead of our own dream.\"",

    "summary": "Enceladus has long been considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth because of its hidden ocean and plumes of water erupting from cracks near its south pole.",
    "story": [
      "The ocean hidden under the icy shell of Saturn's moon Enceladus harbors complex organic molecules, a study said Wednesday, offering further evidence that the small world could have all the right ingredients to host extraterrestrial life.",
      "Just 310 miles wide and invisible to the naked eye, the white, scar-covered Enceladus is one of hundreds of moons orbiting the sixth planet from the sun.",
      "For a long time, scientists believed Enceladus was too far away from the sun \u2014 and therefore too cold \u2014 to be habitable.",
      "Then the Cassini space probe flew past the moon several times during a 2004-2017 trip to Saturn and its rings, discovering evidence that a vast saltwater ocean is concealed under the moon's miles-thick layer of ice.",
      "Since then, scientists have been sifting through the data collected by Cassini, revealing that the ocean has many of the elements thought to be needed to host life, including salt, methane, carbon dioxide and phosphorus.",
      "When the spacecraft passed over the moon's south pole, it discovered jets of water bursting through cracks on the surface.",
      "These jets were propelling tiny ice particles \u2014 smaller than grains of sand \u2014 into space. While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon's surface, others collected around one of Saturn's many rings.",
      "When Cassini flew through Saturn's outermost \"E\" ring, it was \"detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,\" Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space agency.",
      "\"There are many possible pathways from the organic molecules we found in the Cassini data to potentially biologically relevant compounds, which enhances the likelihood that the moon is habitable,\" Nozair said.",
      "By looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules \u2014 including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.",
      "But these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years \u2014 or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.",
      "So the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.",
      "Luckily, they already had access to some.",
      "When Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon's surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft's Cosmic Dust Analyzer at around 11 miles a second.",
      "But it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.",
      "\"Being habitable and being inhabited are two very different things. We believe that Enceladus is habitable, but we do not know if life is indeed present,\" the University of Washington's Fabian Klenner, who took part in the study, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Having a variety of organic compounds on an extraterrestrial water world is simply phenomenal,\" Klenner told the AP in an email.",
      "\"Another piece of the puzzle\"",
      "Study co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that \"the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn's E ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus's ocean.\"",
      "French astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was \"not much doubt\" that these molecules were in the moon's ocean.",
      "But this confirmation provides \"another piece in the puzzle,\" she added.",
      "It also shows that recent technology such as artificial intelligence allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.",
      "But to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.",
      "The European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.",
      "After all, \"Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,\" the agency said in the statement.",
      "Khawaja added that \"even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.\"",
      "NASA has a spacecraft en route to another enticing target to hunt for the ingredients of life: Jupiter's moon Europa. The Europa Clipper is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in 2030 with dozens of Europa flybys. ESA also has a spacecraft, Juice, that's headed to Jupiter to explore Europa and two other icy moons that could hold buried oceans.",
      "Underground oceans on moons \"are perhaps the best candidates for the emergence of extraterrestrial life in our solar system. This work only confirms the need for further studies,\" University of Kent physics professor Nigel Mason, who was not involved in the latest findings, told the AP.",

      "Escobar brought a small number of the African beasts to Colombia in the late 1980s.",
      "After his death the animals were left to roam freely beyond the estate's boundaries and to multiply. They now number around 150.",
      "Colombia has declared them an invasive species and experts previously said sterilization alone is not enough to control the growth of the invasive species, which is why the government is arranging for the possible\u00a0transfer of hippos\u00a0to overseas sanctuaries. But the cost of deporting the hippos is also expensive \u2014 an estimated\u00a0$3.5 million.",

Goodall had been scheduled to take part in an event in Pasadena to kick off an initiative, named TREEAMS (Trees + Dreams), in partnership with the institute. At the event Wednesday, a moment of silence was held for Goodall, and a prerecorded video was played of her talking about the importance of youth and their ability to change the world.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall's discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the institute said in its statement announcing Goodall's death.",
      "Goodall started documenting the lives and habits of chimpanzees in Tanzania as a young woman in the 1960s \u2014 but her passion for animals began long before that, in childhood. She told CBS News\u00a0she would spend hours in a tree at her home in Bournemouth, England, with library books, dreaming of Africa. \"I'll go to Africa, live with animals, write books about them. That was it,\" she said.",

      "For the first time since being elected in May,\u00a0Pope Leo XIV\u00a0waded into U.S. politics, criticizing those who say they're against abortion but support the death penalty, saying that's \"not really pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, was asked late Tuesday about plans by Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich to give a lifetime achievement award to Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin for his work helping immigrants. The plans drew objection from some conservative U.S. bishops, given the powerful Democratic senator's support for abortion rights.",
      "Leo called first of all for respect for both sides, but he also pointed out the seeming contradiction in such debates.",
      "\"Someone who says 'I'm against abortion but says I am in favor of the death penalty' is not really pro-life,\" Leo told reporters. \"Someone who says that 'I'm against abortion, but I'm in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States,' I don't know if that's pro-life.\"",
      "Leo, whose words echoed a common Catholic argument often made in discussions about abortion, spoke hours before Cupich announced that Durbin had declined the award.",
      "\"I am not terribly familiar with the particular case. I think it's important to look at the overall work that a senator has done during, if I'm not mistaken, in 40 years of service in the United States Senate,\" the pope told reporters on Tuesday in response to a question from EWTN News.",
      "In his comments about the Illinois dispute, Leo made no mention of President Trump, whose administration has carried out a surge of immigration enforcement in the Chicago area.",
      "Still, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt weighed in and disputed concerns raised by Pope Leo about the treatment of immigrants, saying that she \"would reject there is inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in the United States under this administration.\"",
      "The administration, Leavitt said, \"is trying to enforce our nation's laws in the most humane way possible.\"",
      "Church teaching forbids abortion, but it also opposes capital punishment as \"inadmissible\" under all circumstances. U.S. bishops and the Vatican have strongly called for humane treatment of migrants, citing the Biblical command to \"welcome the stranger.\"",
      "Responding to a question in English from the U.S. Catholic broadcaster EWTN News, the pope said there were many ethical issues that constitute the teaching of the Catholic Church.",
      "\"I don't know if anyone has all the truth on them but I would ask first and foremost that there be greater respect for one another and that we search together both as human beings, in that case as American citizens or citizens of the state of Illinois, as well as Catholics to say we need to you know really look closely at all of these ethical issues and to find the way forward in this church. Church teaching on each one of those issues is very clear,\" he said.",
      "Cupich was a close adviser to Pope Francis, who strongly upheld church teaching opposing abortion but also criticized the politicizing of the abortion debate by U.S. bishops. Some bishops had called for denying Communion to Catholic politicians who supported abortion rights, including former President Joe Biden.",
      "Biden met on several occasions with Francis and told reporters in 2021 that Francis had told him to continue receiving Communion. During a visit to Rome that year, he received the sacrament during Mass at a church in Francis' diocese.",
      "Durbin was barred from receiving Communion in his home diocese of Springfield in 2004. Springfield Bishop Thomas Paprocki has continued the prohibition and was one of the U.S. bishops who strongly objected to Cupich's decision to honor the senator. Cupich claims Durbin as a member of the Chicago Archdiocese, where Durbin also has a home.",
      "In his statement announcing that Durbin would decline the award, Cupich lamented that the polarization in the U.S. has created a situation where U.S. Catholics \"find themselves politically homeless\" since neither the Republican nor the Democratic party fully encapsulates the breadth of Catholic teaching.",
      "He defended honoring Durbin for his pro-immigration stance, and said the planned Nov. 3 award ceremony could have been an occasion to engage him and other political leaders with the hope of pressing the church's view on other issues, including abortion.",
      "\"It could be an invitation to Catholics who tirelessly promote the dignity of the unborn, the elderly, and the sick to extend the circle of protection to immigrants facing in this present moment an existential threat to their lives and the lives of their families,\" Cupich wrote.",
      "Paprocki, for his part, thanked Durbin for declining the award. \"I ask that all Catholics continue to pray for our church, our country, and for the human dignity of all people to be respected in all stages of life, including the unborn and immigrants,\" Paprocki said in a Facebook post.",

      "Researchers observed \"electrophysiological changes\" in the group that received the experimental medication. (iStock)",

      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with at least two days of strength training and activities to improve balance.",
      "However, these recommendations should be modified to meet each individual\u2019s physical abilities and conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" Marfred Suazo, a fitness professional known as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. (iStock)",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with fitness experts to identify some of the most common mistakes older adults make when working out and how to avoid them.",
      "\"Most people focus only on the chest, arms, quads and abs, because that is what they see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"But ignoring your back, glutes, hamstrings and core creates poor posture, weak links and, eventually, pain.\"",
      "OLDER ADULTS SHOULD TARGET THESE MUSCLES WHEN STRENGTH-TRAINING, SAYS FITNESS PRO",
      "To counteract this, Suazo recommends training the muscles you cannot see, a strategy he calls \"non-mirror training.\"",
      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",
      "\"Simple drills like ankle mobility before squats or single-leg balance work can have a huge payoff in long-term health,\" Markfeld said.",

      "Office of Management and Budget chief Russell Vought and President Donald Trump are in the midst of mapping out cuts to the federal government after lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to reach a funding bill agreement.\u00a0 (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press\u00a0)",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with Richard Stern, the Heritage Foundation's director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget, Thursday morning to discuss which agencies the OMB chief would likely target for staffing cuts and if such cuts would be permanent.",
      "How a shutdown enables cuts",
      "Stern explained to Fox Digital that there are a pair of overlapping issues that lead to the government's staffing size. Agencies are required by various laws to provide certain services to citizens. And, separately, appropriation bills set funding floors on how much money an agency has available to spend on staff payroll.",
      "During a shutdown, however, there is a lapse in funding, meaning agencies do not have \"payroll floors from the funding bill,\" leaving the executive branch with discretion on how to continue providing required services to citizens, he explained.",
      "\"Because the funding bills set effective floors per salary spending, that tends to dictate how many people work for the agencies. In the event of a shutdown, the only requirement on the administration is to ensure that the agencies provide the services and whatnot that are required by law. But those laws don't say you need, you know, 100 staffers to write a grant or only one staffer,\" Stern told Fox Digital in a phone interview.",
      "WHITE HOUSE PREPARES FOR 'IMMINENT' FEDERAL LAYOFFS AFTER DEMOCRATS FORCE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN",
      "\"They simply say, you know, 'There's a grant program that has to go out the door under XYZ parameters.' So, in the event of a lapse in funding, it means that the administration \u2026 can lay out a plan saying, \u2018Hey, look, you know, we think the Department of Education, for example, could do everything it is legally required to do, but do it with 10% of the workforce,\u2019\" he continued.",

      "If the administration determines that an agency can fulfill its legally required services to citizens with fewer people, it will subsequently send reduction in force notices, known as RIFs, to staffers.",
      "\"If the funding was there, and if the funding law required those staff levels, then you wouldn't be able to RIF,\" he said. \"But in the lapse of funding, it gives the White House that opportunity.\"",
      "Permanent changes to the government are in a gray zone, however, because RIFs would not be able to take effect until after 60 days.",
      "\"Once the RIF notices go out, you \u2026 legally need to wait 60 days before the RIF notices can be enacted,\" Stern continued. \"Really the shutdown would have to last 60 days, beyond that, to actually act on the RIFs.\"",
      "The Heritage Foundation expert, who also serves as the conservative think tank's acting director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, stressed that any staffing cuts are not an example of government \"downsizing.\"",

      "\"Look, it's likely going to be in the thousands. It's a very good question. And that's something that the Office of Management and Budget and the entire team at the White House here, again, is unfortunately having to work on today,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Stern pointed to a handful of agencies that will likely be targeted for layoffs, citing agencies that have \"mission creeped\" their original purview into regulatory issues, such as the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as other agencies, like the National Science Foundation, that handle grant writing for programs.",
      "\"Probably the Department of Ed is, is kind of the poster child on this one,\" he said. \"They've been talking about, they quite literally only need 10% or so on the staff.\"",
      "He also noted the EPA, Department of the Interior and the Department of Labor could face cuts due to the various agencies' \"mission creep into a lot of regulations that are quite harmful to the economy, that are quite harmful to just American families.\"",
      "WHITE HOUSE TELLS FEDERAL AGENCIES TO PREPARE LAYOFF PLANS AS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN LOOMS",
      "\"EPA over \u2026 a decade or so, has mission creeped its jurisdiction into more and more regulatory affairs, that just simply the EPA doesn't have under a statutory capacity,\" he said. \"They're regulating outside of the confines, the charge they were given by law, by Congress. So, EPA is another one of those where that makes a lot of sense to cut a lot of the workforce there. Then, at HUD and Department of Labor you have similar things.\"",
      "Stern said the administration likely is also eyeing agencies such as the National Science Foundation, National Endowment for the Arts and Humanities and certain aspects of the Department of Housing and Urban Development that are charged with \"running programs that write grants where there's an enormous amount of legal discretion on who gets the grant money.\"",
      "President Donald Trump said the shutdown presented the opportunity for the administration to carry out layoffs as part of a continued mission to slim down the federal government.\u00a0 (Alex Brandon/The Associated Press\u00a0)",
      "\"These grants are not serving some critical, or frankly, constitutional role,\" he said, adding the grants often land in the hands of universities and promote \"left-wing\" ideology on topics, such as transgenderism and climate change.",
      "What has Trump said on federal cuts?",
      "Trump said during various public remarks Tuesday, as the deadline clock began to run dry, the shutdown presented him with the opportunity for the administration to carry out layoffs as part of a continued mission to slim down the federal government and snuff out overspending and fraud. Trump, however, repeatedly has stressed he does not support the shutdown, pinning blame on Democrats.",
      "WHITE HOUSE PREPARES FOR 'IMMINENT' FEDERAL LAYOFFS AFTER DEMOCRATS FORCE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN",
      "\"We don't want it to shut down because we have the greatest period of time ever,\" Trump said from the Oval Office Tuesday. \"I tell you, we have $17 trillion being invested. So, the last person that wants it shut down is us.",
      "\"Now, with that being said, we can do things during the shutdown that are irreversible, that are bad for them and irreversible by them, like cutting vast numbers of people out, cutting things that they like, cutting programs that they like,\" he continued.",
      "Republicans have pinned the shutdown blame on Democrats, arguing they refused to fund the budget as an attempt to reinstate taxpayer-funded medical benefits for illegal immigrants. Democrats have countered that claim as a \"lie\" and cast blame for the shutdown on Republicans.",
      "\"A lot of good can come down from shutdowns,\" Trump added Tuesday. \"We can get rid of a lot of things that we didn't want, and they'd be Democrat things. But they want open borders.

Losing access to Facebook or Instagram can have real consequences for both individuals and businesses, making people more likely to fall for urgent security warnings.

      "Cybercriminals are targeting Facebook and Instagram accounts by sending fake security warnings. (Fox News)",
      "How the FileFix attack works",
      "As reported by researchers at Acronis,\u00a0a leading cybersecurity and data protection company, the attack begins with a phishing page that looks like a message from Meta's support team, claiming that your account will be disabled in seven days unless you view an \"incident report.\" Instead of providing an actual document, the page disguises a malicious PowerShell command as a file path.",
      "Victims are instructed to copy it, open File Explorer, and paste it into the address bar. While it appears harmless, this action secretly runs code that starts the malware infection process.",
      "This method is part of a family of attacks known as ClickFix, where people are tricked into pasting commands into system dialogs. FileFix, created by Red Team researcher mr.d0x, builds on that idea by exploiting the File Explorer address bar instead. In this campaign, the attackers improved the trick by hiding the malicious command behind long strings of spaces, so only the fake file path is visible to the victim.",
      "A hidden script then downloads what looks like a JPG image from Bitbucket, but the file contains embedded code. Once executed, it extracts another script and decrypts the final payload, bypassing many security tools in the process.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "FileFix sends out fake alerts urging users to review their account security. (Acronis)",
      "What StealC tries to steal",
      "The malware delivered by this campaign is StealC, an infostealer that collects a wide range of personal and organizational data. It is designed to grab browser credentials and authentication cookies from Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and other browsers.",
      "It also targets messaging apps like Discord, Telegram and Pidgin, along with cryptocurrency wallets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Exodus. StealC goes further by attempting to compromise cloud accounts from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Azure, VPN services like ProtonVPN and even gaming accounts from Battle.net and Ubisoft. In addition, it can take screenshots of the victim's desktop, giving attackers a live view of sensitive activity.",
      "Acronis reported that the campaign has already appeared in several different versions over a short period, with changes in payloads and infrastructure. This suggests that the attackers are actively testing and refining their methods to avoid detection and improve success rates.",

      "StealC also targets VPN software and cryptocurrency wallets. (iStock)",
      "5 ways you can protect yourself from FileFix attacks",
      "To stay protected against attacks like FileFix and prevent malware such as StealC from stealing sensitive information, you need to combine caution with practical security measures. The following steps can help safeguard accounts, devices, and personal data.",
      "Attackers rely on panic. Treat any message claiming your Meta account or other services will be disabled within days with caution. Verify the alert directly through official platforms rather than clicking links or following instructions from an email or web page.",
      "FileFix relies on convincing you to paste hidden PowerShell commands disguised as file paths. Never paste commands into system dialogs, File Explorer, or terminals unless you are absolutely certain of their origin.",
      "FileFix and StealC thrive on the information they can extract from a device or linked accounts. By using data removal services, you reduce the amount of sensitive personal information that can be found online or left exposed on old platforms. This minimizes what attackers can exploit if they manage to gain access.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A strong antivirus software can detect malware like StealC before it fully executes. Many solutions now include behavior-based detection that can flag suspicious scripts or hidden downloads, helping catch threats even when attackers try to disguise commands as harmless actions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

A fake Meta alert may feel urgent, but pausing before you click or copy anything is the best defense. Relying on strong habits and security tools gives you the upper hand.

      "The newly patched vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-10585, stems from a type confusion weakness in Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Google's Threat Analysis Group (TAG) discovered and reported the bug on Tuesday, and the company shipped a fix the following day, Bleeping Computer reported.",
      "Google confirmed that the flaw was being exploited in the wild, though it did not share technical details or name the groups behind the attacks. TAG has a history of uncovering zero-days tied to government-sponsored spyware campaigns aimed at high-risk individuals such as opposition leaders, journalists and dissidents.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "The fact that Chrome has already faced six zero-day attacks this year shows how relentless attackers are and how even the most popular software can have serious gaps.

      "Why should you keep those spam emails?",
      "We know this sounds counter-intuitive, but keeping spam emails, at least for a short while, serves an important purpose. Your email provider can use them to refine their spam detection algorithms. The best course of action is to report them, so providers can develop better ways to identify harmful or unwanted messages. This will improve their chances of detecting them before they hit your inbox. Deleting these emails makes them useless to anyone. Furthermore, your failure to contribute to this improvement means the problem persists not only for you but for others.",
      "When we say \"a short while,\" we don't mean forever. Usually, keeping them in your junk folder for a few days to a week is enough for your provider to process and learn from them. After you've reported the spam or phishing attempt, you can safely delete it.",

      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",

AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools.

They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted.

These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",

All of this is possible because hackers use a tactic called SEO poisoning, which manipulates Google's search results so their fake websites appear near the top. Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",

      "Before clicking \"download,\" carefully inspect the domain name. Hackers often create lookalike domains that look nearly identical to real ones, adding small spelling changes or extra words. Even small differences can indicate a fake site designed to deliver malware.",

      "PROVO, Utah \u2014 One of the biggest vulnerabilities in the case against Charlie Kirk's accused assassin, Tyler Robinson, could be the prosecution's timeline, according to a prominent Utah defense attorney \u2014 and she expects the defense to drag discovery in the case on for up to a year before he finally gets a preliminary hearing.",
      "Kirk, a 31-year-old father of two, was shot and killed around 12:20 p.m. on Sept. 10 while speaking at a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University. He was a founder of the conservative student group, which had a national footprint and is credited for a resurgence of youth support for the Republican Party.",

      "The defense doesn't know much yet, either. The discovery process began Monday with a five-day deadline for prosecutors to make their initial disclosures, and Robinson's team already pushed his waiver hearing back by a month.",

      "Some evidence has been made public already, at news briefings, in comments from authorities or in the charging documents filed last week. Prosecutors included damning text messages between Robinson and his roommate and romantic partner, Lance Twiggs, in which he allegedly took responsibility for Kirk's murder. But they don't include timestamps.",
      "Robinson, 22, was arrested in his hometown in southern Utah 33 hours after the murder. Before that, he allegedly returned to the crime scene, where police found the suspected murder weapon, Fox News Digital was first to report \u2014 still, authorities have not made clear the timing of his encounter with a police officer stationed at the perimeter.",
      "\"If it doesn't line up in a way that makes sense, it could definitely be bad for them,\" Lazaro told Fox News Digital.",
      "Robinson allegedly told the officer he wanted to get something he left near a parking garage in the area \u2014 which is also near where police found the rifle, according to a law enforcement source. That wasn't immediately deemed suspicious because hundreds of people had dropped things as they fled for safety in the wake of Kirk's shooting death in front of a crowd of roughly 3,000. But the officer did a routine check on Robinson's license plate, which authorities linked to the encounter after he had been identified as a potential suspect, according to the source.",

      "Gaps in what authorities have said publicly have also led to speculation online, much of which is unsubstantiated, and that won't be of much use to the defense, Lazaro added.",
      "\"There are some conspiracy theories about...somebody else wrote the text messages or something was planted,\" Lazaro said. \"As a defense attorney, unless you absolutely know and can prove that something like that happened, that\u2019s not the greatest defense, right? I think you tend to lose credibility unless you really can substantiate it.\"",

      "While there's no expectation that Robinson's defense would have the case tossed at such a hearing, it could still give the defense a chance to find better footing before trial \u2014 such as a chance to cross-examine witnesses before trial and see how well they perform under intense questioning.",

      "\"The rise of open and violent anti-Semitism in America is more recent than in much of Europe, but perhaps all the more worrying because of that,\" Ruhe said. \"Part of the solution is colleges shutting down far-left campus \u2018protests\u2019 that intend only to intimidate Jews and anyone who calls for policies short of ending Israel's existence.",

      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov used his address to the United Nations General Assembly (UGNA) Saturday to deliver one of Moscow\u2019s starkest warnings yet to the West, accusing NATO and the European Union of waging a \"real war\" against Russia.",
      "Lavrov opened with sweeping historical references to World War II, positioning Russia as the heir to the Soviet Union\u2019s role in defeating Nazism and defending global sovereignty. He accused the U.S. of dismantling those postwar principles through interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya and warned that the same was happening today in the Middle East.",
      "While condemning Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack, Lavrov said Israel\u2019s campaign in Gaza amounted to \"collective punishment\" of civilians, linking the conflict to what he portrayed as decades of unchecked Western use of force.",

      "UN SECURITY COUNCIL REJECTS CHINA-RUSSIA RESOLUTION EXTENDING IRAN NUCLEAR SANCTIONS RELIEF BEFORE DEADLINE",
      "He singled out claims by European leaders as \"false portrayals\" of Moscow\u2019s intentions, echoing President Vladimir Putin\u2019s denials that Russia plans to strike NATO or EU territory.",
      "At the same time, Lavrov issued a direct threat, saying, \"Any aggression against my country will be met with a decisive response. There should be no doubt about this among those in NATO and the EU.\"",
      "The warning comes amid heightened tension along NATO\u2019s eastern flank. Estonia recently accused Russian jets of violating its airspace, and NATO forces shot down drones over Poland. The U.S. responded by telling the U.N. Security Council it would \"defend every inch of NATO territory.\" Against this backdrop, Lavrov\u2019s speech underscored Moscow\u2019s effort to frame any clash with NATO as an existential threat to Russia itself.",
      "The timing also intersects with a shift in U.S. rhetoric. President Donald Trump, who met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this week, has hardened his tone on the war, telling reporters that Ukraine can and should reclaim all its territory.",

Lavrov\u2019s UN address seemed calibrated to counter Trump\u2019s new line, reminding Washington that Moscow sees the war not as a distant conflict but as a direct confrontation involving the United States.",
      "Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, in his own address to the General Assembly, warned that failing to stop Russia now would unleash \"the most destructive arms race ever.\"",
      "Lavrov reinforced his message at a press conference after the speech, responding to a question about Western calls to shoot down Russian aircraft that might violate European airspace. He dismissed Trump\u2019s earlier remark that Russia was a \"paper tiger,\" noting that the president had already walked it back.",
      "He then issued a stark warning: \"If there are attempts to down any flying object \u2026 over our territory, in our airspace, then I think people will very much regret it, undertaking such an egregious violation of our territorial integrity and sovereignty.\"",

    "story": [
      "Most of President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters back keeping enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans, the central obstacle in ending the government shutdown, according to a new poll from the nonpartisan health policy research group KFF. It was conducted Sept. 23 through Sept. 29, just days before Congress failed to pass a funding measure to keep the government open.",
      "More than 22 million people receive the subsidies, which are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. Losing the subsidies could mean that average out-of-pocket premium payments could double in 2026, from $888 a year to $1,904, an earlier KFF analysis found.",
      "Around 4 million people are projected to go without coverage next year because they can no longer afford it, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Extending them would cost the federal government around $350 billion over the next decade.",
      "The new survey found 59% of Republicans and 57% of \u201cMake American Great Again\u201d supporters favor extending the enhanced subsidies.",
      "The nationally representative sample of 1,334 adults were asked whether they support extending the subsidies, not whether they support including them in budget negotiations. Whether to include them is a sticking point in the ongoing budget battle, with Democrats arguing they must be extended before open enrollment next month, when many enrollees will be shocked to find their premiums are increasing.",
      "Overall, more than three-quarters of the public \u2014 78% \u2014 say they want Congress to extend them. That includes 92% of Democrats and 82% of independents.",
      "\u201cWe get a very clear message that the majority of the public, regardless of their partisanship, regardless of their insurance, support Congress extending these tax credits,\u201d said Ashley Kirzinger, the director of survey methodology and associate director of the public opinion and survey research program at KFF. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to take a benefit away after it\u2019s been given to people.\u201d",
      "We\u2019d like to hear from you about how you\u2019re experiencing the government shutdown, whether you\u2019re a federal employee who can\u2019t work right now or someone who is feeling the effects of shuttered services in your everyday life. Please contact us at tips@nbcuni.com or reach out to us here.",
      "The enhanced subsidies were put into place under the 2021 American Rescue Plan, which made ACA plans affordable for many middle-class families. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended them through 2025.",
      "Standard ACA subsidies for people with very low incomes are expected to continue \u2014 although their premiums are expected to rise too without the additional tax credit, and they also may be at risk of losing their coverage.",
      "According to the poll, about 4 in 10 people with an ACA plan say they would go without insurance if the amount they had to pay each month nearly doubled.",
      "Similar shares \u2014 37% \u2014 said they would continue to pay for their current health plan, while 2 in 10 say they would get coverage from another source, like an employer.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to result in a large number of individuals losing health coverage and becoming uninsured,\u201d Kirzinger said. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have health coverage, not being able to go to the doctor, not being able to get primary care, it can result in all kinds of detrimental health outcomes.\u201d",
      "Dr. Adam Gaffney, a critical care physician and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School, said going without insurance can also devastate people\u2019s finances.",
      "\u201cThey accrue large bills, debt and even go bankrupt,\u201d he said.",
      "Some people who keep their insurance may also take a hit to their finances. When respondents were asked if they could afford coverage if their premiums nearly doubled, 7 in 10 who purchase their own insurance say they would not be able to afford the premiums without significantly cutting back on their household budgets.",
      "Despite the risk to peoples\u2019 health and finances, many Americans still don\u2019t know that the enhanced subsidies are set to end.",

    "summary": "Republican Senate Leader John Thune said the government shutdown is \"stupid\" and a negotiation with Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer won't \"accomplish a lot.\"",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 On the second day of the shutdown, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called it \u201cstupid\u201d and said a negotiation with his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Chuck Schumer, is not \u201cgoing to accomplish a lot.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News' Tom Llamas that will air Thursday night, Thune said Democrats will have another opportunity Friday afternoon to join Republicans in voting for a clean, short-term bill to reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI would suspect that we\u2019ll probably cross paths on the floor; we\u2019re both on the floor quite often. Our offices are not far apart. So if he wants to chat, he knows where to find me,\u201d Thune said of Schumer, D-N.Y., the minority leader. \u201cBut I think at this point, right now, the issue ... is pretty straightforward. I don\u2019t know that, you know, negotiation is going to accomplish a lot.\"",
      "\u201cThis is a seven-week funding resolution just to keep the government funded so we can continue doing the appropriations work that we started earlier this year,\u201d he added.",
      "Negotiations between Republican and Democratic leaders have been at a standstill ever since they left a meeting with President Donald Trump at the White House on Monday without a deal. Trump followed up the meeting by posting an insulting artificial intelligence video of Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and personal jabs have flown back and forth since.",
      "The government shut down Wednesday for the first time in six years, with no signs of reopening.",
      "Schumer and the Democrats demand that any funding bill include an extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year. But Thune has insisted he will not negotiate on those tax credits until Democrats help Republicans reopen the government.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m all about getting it back open again. I think shutdowns are\u2014 nobody wins, and I think honestly, for the most part, they\u2019re stupid,\u201d Thune said in the interview. \u201cWe really shouldn\u2019t be shutting the government down, and it shouldn\u2019t be taken hostage to do other policy things that are totally unrelated to funding the government.\u201d",
      "In a statement Thursday, Schumer suggested the American people were turning against Republicans, who control all levers of power in Washington.",
      "\u201cAmericans see it clearly: They know Trump governs by chaos and welcomes this shutdown \u2014 and that Republicans are following his orders to maximize pain. That cruelty is already backfiring,\" Schumer said. \"Americans blame Trump and Republicans for the shutdown, and the longer they drag it out, the deeper the pain and that blame will grow.\"",
      "Pressed by Llamas, Thune defended Trump and his top aides who have said they plan to move forward this week with permanent federal layoffs due to the shutdown, as well as revoking billions in federal funding for projects in blue states like New York, the home state of both Schumer and Jeffries. Thune said none of those things would happen if the Democrats helped reopen the government.",
      "\"Tom, let's come back to the basic premise: This is avoidable,\" Thune said, adding that the Democrats \"are playing with fire by doing this.\"",
      "He added that Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, and other administration officials would make spending decisions during the shutdown based on where \"their political priorities lie.\"",
      "\"It\u2019s very simple: You avoid this by just voting to keep the government open,\" he said.",
      "The Senate did not hold votes on Thursday in honor of the Yom Kippur holiday. It has scheduled votes at 1:30 p.m. ET Friday on dueling Republican and Democratic plans to reopen the government. Yet those same funding bills have already failed three times before.",
      "If the proposals are defeated for a fourth time, Thune said earlier Thursday, the Senate will most likely not hold any votes over the weekend. That means a shutdown would last at least until Monday, when the House also plans to be back in town following a two-week recess.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll have a fourth chance tomorrow to vote to keep, to open up the government,\u201d Thune told reporters in the Capitol. \u201cAnd if that fails, then we have the weekend to think about it. We\u2019ll come back. We\u2019ll vote again on Monday.\u201d"

Ocasio-Cortez, who is in her fourth term, didn\u2019t rule out a Senate bid but instead said it\u2019s not something with which voters are concerned.",
      "\u201cPeople are going to die. Nobody cares about some election years from now. They care about if their kids can get insulin, if they can put food on the table,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that her caucus remains \u201ctremendously united\u201d in its demands to end the shutdown and that she and her fellow Democrats aren\u2019t intimidated by White House threats around mass layoffs and funding cuts. She said it\u2019s not necessary for her to be front and center in the negotiations.",
      "\u201cIt is so important to understand that these people are all talk. They are all talk. They are negotiating with Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, and Democratic leadership and Democrats are united to that end.\u201d"

      "Arthur Aidala, Weinstein's longtime criminal defense attorney, said he refers clients to Rothfeld because the \"fear of the unknown\" is overwhelming.",
      "\"Preparing to enter prison, and then crossing that threshold, is an experience whose horror is truly indescribable,\" Aidala said this week. \"For most people, it feels insurmountable.\"",
      "In the case of Raniere, who was sentenced to 120 years in federal prison in 2019 on sex trafficking and child pornography charges, Rothfeld\u2019s first task was to get him out of solitary confinement, he said.",
      "Raniere was confined to solitary in 2022 after he was allegedly assaulted by another inmate.",
      "\u201cIf you spent 280 days in the SHU [Special Housing Unit] with no explanation whatsoever and you have feces on the floor and the walls, yeah, your human rights are being violated,\u201d he said.",
      "One of Raniere's attorneys, Ronald Sullivan, said navigating the federal Bureau of Prisons requires knowledge of a \"byzantine set of regulations, the understanding of which can make a tangible difference in time served.\"",
      "He said that regulations change frequently and that relationships with prison officials often determine how quickly or slowly requests are granted.",
      "Rothfeld said conditions at Rikers Island and the Metropolitan Detention Center in New York City are \"deplorable.\"",
      "\u201cSome days you have cold water, and that\u2019s it. Sometimes you don\u2019t get to shower for the week,\u201d he said. \u201cThe food is inedible. Quite often, there\u2019s leaks coming from the ceiling. There\u2019s broken lights in cells, there\u2019s mice, there\u2019s cockroaches. It is completely inhumane.\u201d",
      "Officials at Rikers Island, a jail that is operated by the city of New York, did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The federal Bureau of Prisons, which oversees the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, said that it makes every effort to ensure inmates\u2019 physical safety and health and that their treatment is humane. It also said the detention center provides nutritionally adequate meals.",
      "Rothfeld said he charges a flat fee for his services but would not provide specifics. He said celebrity clients account for only about 2% of his business.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t cost what an attorney costs. I don\u2019t cost six figures. I don\u2019t cost what a brand-new, fancy sport car costs,\u201d he said. \u201cI work with families to meet them where they\u2019re at.\u201d",
      "It is not publicly known whether Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the former music mogul who is scheduled to be sentenced Friday, has hired a prison consultant. Prosecutors are seeking a sentence of 11 years and three months in federal prison after he was found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center for over a year.",
      "Rothfeld said Combs can expect better conditions in a federal prison than at the detention center.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019ll be able to go outside,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019ll be a yard of access to fresh air. He\u2019ll be able to work out if he wants to work out. The second thing is the nature of his living quarters. In all probability, he will be in a dorm-like setting. Anything is nicer or better, relatively speaking, than the MDC.\u201d",
      "Rothfeld said he encourages his clients to become voracious readers.",
      "\u201cI always recommend that people read fantasy,\" he said. \"Speaking from personal experience, I read 'Game of Thrones' when I was in prison, and it got me outside of where I was.\u201d",
      "For the victims of the crimes his clients have committed, Rothfeld said he is not an arbiter of morality.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not my job to judge; it\u2019s not my job to argue. It\u2019s my job to advocate. And as I tell people, the punishment is prison,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe, no matter who you are, famous or not \u2014 most of my clients no one\u2019s ever heard of \u2014 you should have humane living conditions. Your civil rights should be honored when you\u2019re incarcerated.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe have been worried about this all year,\u201d said Dr. Chase Shutak, a pediatrician and medical director at Children\u2019s Minnesota in Minneapolis. \u201cWhen the outbreaks began in Texas, all of us anticipated that it would eventually work its way up into our state.\u201d",
      "Shutak was referring to a massive measles outbreak in West Texas, which totaled 762 cases. Ninety-nine patients needed to be hospitalized as a result of the outbreak, and two young girls died.",
      "In Minnesota, as of Thursday afternoon one child had been hospitalized at Children\u2019s Minnesota, a spokesperson said.",
      "Most of the Minnesota cases are among families who traveled within the U.S., according to the state\u2019s health department. None of the children had received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. It was unclear, however, whether the patients were old enough to qualify for the shots, usually given in two doses starting around age 1.",
      "Arizona, too, is dealing with a large, growing outbreak that has spread across the area bordering southwestern Utah.",

      "If outbreaks continue around the country until the end of January, the United States will lose its status of having had eliminated measles 25 years ago. This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a total of 1,544 confirmed measles cases. Of those, just 21 cases were diagnosed in people visiting the U.S. from other countries.",

      "Federal Reserve officials are also considering next steps for interest rates.",
      "When the Fed cut borrowing costs last month, Chairman Jerome Powell warned that the overall economic picture was so unusual that central bankers were having a hard time forecasting what would come next.",
      "\u201cOrdinarily, when the labor market is weak, inflation is low, and when the labor market is really strong, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got to be careful about inflation,\u201d Powell said at a mid-September news conference in Washington.",

      "Even if the shutdown is resolved in the coming days, it's still not certain when top officials and the public should expect to see September's jobs report.",
      "\u201cAs soon as this government opens...we want to get these numbers out,\u201d Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told Fox Business on Friday.",
      "In 2013, it took four days after federal agencies reopened following a 17-day government shutdown for BLS to release the previous month\u2019s jobs data. The monthly Consumer Price Index data was not released for more than a week after the shutdown was over.",
      "That year, the Fed\u2019s two-day October meeting began with officials still lacking the previous month\u2019s key inflation data.",
      "It was only on the second day of the meeting that officials were finally able to review the inflation report, just hours before they announced their interest rate decision.",
      "Further complicating matters for the Fed is that any shutdown creates additional uncertainty of its own in the economy, as thousands of federal workers\u2019 paychecks are delayed and government services are severely restricted.",
      "Still, a government shutdown alone is unlikely to be enough to shift the Fed\u2019s thinking on interest rates.",
      "Most economists believe that the current shutdown\u2019s economic impact will be minimal and that any dent to growth will be made up in the coming months.",
      "Fed policymakers already face a formidable challenge: predicting how President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented, and rapidly evolving, economic policies will affect the labor market and inflation.",
      "\u201cWith all this change, a dense fog has fallen,\u201d Richmond, Virginia, Fed President Tom Barkin said in March in a lecture at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift's 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl\" is out \u2014 and it's full of songs seemingly inspired by Taylor Swift's fianc\u00e9, Travis Kelce.",
      "The singer first announced the new album while appearing on Kelce's podcast, \"New Heights,\" in August. Since then, the Kansas City Chiefs star has been his fianc\u00e9e's biggest hype man.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been fortunate enough to hear every single song on here. So I know they\u2019re all 12 bangers,\u201d he said during a recent episode of the podcast.",
      "Kelce also said he keeps listening to the album and has been \"dancing all throughout the house.\"",
      "\u201cI know she mentioned that it\u2019s gonna be a lot more pop beats and everything, but it\u2019s just, it\u2019s still so poetic, and how she (executes) her melodies and her references and stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "The adoration is clearly mutual since Swift included numerous nods to her better half in the lyrics of her new album. Below, we're decoding all the references.",
      "'Opalite'",
      "During a recent episode of his \"New Heights\" podcast, Kelce revealed that he was loving one particular song from the album.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Opalite\u2019 might be my favorite, though, at least right now. Every time it comes on, I always catch myself,\u201d he said.",
      "Swift's fans started theorizing about the song and wondering if it was a nod to Kelce since opal is one of his birthstones. Although opal and opalite are slightly different, the theory turned out to be true.",
      "During an interview on Capital FM on Oct. 3, Swift confirmed that \"Opalite\" is Kelce's favorite song off the new album and explained how his birthstone inspired the track.",
      "\"I have favorite words, favorite phrases, things that I\u2019ll put in an endless file of lyrics that I\u2019m just constantly going to go and cherry pick from when I\u2019m writing. And I had written down the word opalite because I learned that it\u2019s actually a man-made opal. Opal can be man-made just like diamonds,\" she said.",
      "The singer went on to note that opal is Travis' birthstone and she's always \"loved that stone.\"",
      "\"I thought it was a kind of a cool metaphor that it\u2019s a man-made opal and happiness can also be man-made too. So that\u2019s kind of what the song is about: the kind of juxtaposition of those two,\" she said.",
      "'Wood'",
      "\"Wood\" is the shortest song on \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" but it's still chock-full of meaning. The track is about being unlucky in love then finding the one she needs.",
      "Fans are picking up on the song's seeming double entendres, as well as the reference to Kelce's \"New Heights\" podcast.",
      "\"Baby, I\u2019ll admit I\u2019ve been a little superstitious/ The curse on me was broken by your magic wand/ Seems to me that you and me, we make our own luck/ New heights of manhood/ I ain\u2019t gotta knock on wood,\" she sings.",
      "\"The Fate of Ophelia\"",
      "In \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" Swift rewrites the story of Ophelia, one of many doomed characters in William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet.\"",
      "In the song, Swift seems to reference Kelce's bold romantic gesture when he tried to meet her at her \"Eras Tour\" and give her a friendship bracelet with his number on it.",
      "\u201cI heard you calling/ On the megaphone/ You wanna see me all alone,\u201d she sings.",
      "Swift also appears to credit Kelce with saving her from the fate of Ophelia as she sings, \"And if you\u2019d never come for me/ I might\u2019ve drowned in the melancholy.\"",
      "During an interview with iHeart, she explained, \u201cThe hook is like, someone comes into your life and rescues you from the fate of being driven mad by love.\u201d",

      "\"I just want you/ Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you/ We tell the world to leave us the f--- alone, and they do,\" she sings.",
      "Later in the song, Swift appears to sing about how she dreamed of finding someone like Kelce.",
      "\"I made wishes on all of the stars/ Please, God bring me a best friend who I think is hot/ I thought I had it right once, twice, but I did not/ You caught me off my guard/ I hope I get what I want/ Cause I know what I want/ I just want you,\" she sings.",
      "While appearing on iHeart Radio, Swift said this particular song is a \u201cvery accurate stance on where I\u2019m at in life.\u201d",
      "'Eldest Daughter'",
      "Swift, who is an eldest daughter herself, sings about many topics, including marriage, in her song \"Eldest Daughter.\"",
      "She even references a youngest child, presumably Kelce. He's the youngest of two boys (and brother Jason Kelce is also an NFL pro).",
      "\u201cWhen I said I don\u2019t believe in marriage, that was a lie/ Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter/ So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire/ But I\u2019m not a bad b---/ And this isn\u2019t savage/ But I\u2019m never gonna let you down/ I\u2019m never gonna leave you out,\u201d she sings.",
      "Swift goes on to say she once made fun of things like \u201cFerris wheels, kisses and lilac,\u201d sing, \u201cCause I thought that I\u2019d never find that.\"",
      "'Honey'",
      "During the love song \"Honey,\" Swift sings about her past experiences with pet names.",
      "\"When anyone called me sweetheart, it was passive aggressive at the bar/ And the b---- was telling me to back off/ Cause her man had looked at me wrong/ If anyone called me honey it was standing in the bathroom, white teeth/ They were saying that skirt don\u2019t fit me and I cried the whole way home,\" she sings.",
      "Swift then transitions to her present situation, where pet names have a positive connotation.",
      "\"But you touch my face redefine all of those blues/ When you say/ You can call me honey if you want because I\u2019m the one you want/ I\u2019m the one you want/ You give it different meaning/ Cause you mean it when you talk,\" she sings.",
      "'Elizabeth Taylor'",
      "Elizabeth Taylor, who was married seven times, knew a thing or two about high-profile relationships. In this song named after the late actor, Swift sings, \"Elizabeth Taylor, do you think it\u2019s forever?\" as she talks about a relationship.",
      "She goes on to describe how this particular romance is different from her past ones, singing, \"All the right guys/ Promised they\u2019d stay/ Under bright lights/ They withered away/ But you bloom.\"",
      "In the song, Swift talks about a man who worships her while others criticize her. She also expresses her fears of losing their love.",
      "\"They say I\u2019m bad news/ I just say thanks/ And you look at me like you\u2019re hypnotized/ And I think you know why/ And if you ever leave me high and dry/I\u2019d cry my eyes violet,\" she sings."

      "Like her \u201cFriends\u201d character, Monica Geller, Courteney Cox enjoys inviting loved ones over to her immaculately clean home in Los Angeles for good food and fun times.",
      "In fact, the actor and Homecourt founder is still hosting the same weekly Sunday night dinner party she began years ago, she told TODAY style correspondent Zanna Roberts Rassi in an interview that aired Oct. 3.",
      "\"My grandmother used to have Sunday gatherings ... and I\u2019m the youngest of 21 first cousins. So when I moved to LA, there wasn\u2019t really a community, because everyone lives so far. So I started doing my own Sundays,\" said Cox.",
      "As you can imagine, Cox's invitees over the years have included plenty of A-listers and even a few \"dream guests.\"",
      "\"I mean, look, I had Elton John there and I played the piano with him. So that would have been a dream. I mean, Stevie Wonder,\" Cox recalled.",
      "It was Cox's close friend Ed Sheeran who brought Sir Elton to her home. Musical magic happened when Cox, Sheeran and singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile joined John for a cover of his 1972 hit \"Tiny Dancer,\" featuring Cox on the piano.",
      "The quartet hilariously opted to sing the mistaken lyrics Phoebe Buffet, played by Lisa Kudrow, once sang on \"Friends,\" which meant changing the phrase \"Hold me closer, tiny dancer\u201d to \u201cHold me closer, Tony Danza.\"",
      "How did Cox and Sheeran persuade Sir Elton to agree to sing such a silly version of his song?",
      "\"I\u2019ve known Ed for about, like, 13 years. I knew Brandi because we did a video together. And Ed said, 'I\u2019m going to have Elton over for dinner, if that\u2019s OK with you,'\" Cox recalled. \"And he said, 'Why don\u2019t you play one of the songs? We could do 'Hold Me Closer.' But he calls it 'Tony Danza,' because that\u2019s the Lisa Kudrow version, the Phoebe version.",
      "\"So I quickly called my piano teacher and said, 'You\u2019ve got to come over and teach me 'Tiny Dancer,'\" Cox continued, adding \"The reason why I stopped the video when I did is because that\u2019s all I had learned. That was it.\"",
      "Cox called performing the song with John \"one of the greatest moments\" of her life.",
      "Sheeran brought a different kind of magic into Cox's life when he showed up to her place one night with members of the Irish rock band Snow Patrol.",
      "Despite the fact that Taylor Swift was also at her home that night, Cox right away noticed the band's guitarist Johnny McDaid, who would later become her boyfriend.",
      "\"I remember seeing (McDaid), and I thought, 'Oh, he\u2019s a really handsome guy.' But we didn\u2019t have this moment at all. And then later on he asked me out,\" she shared.",
      "Cox may have channeled Monica Geller's love of a beautiful living space when she launched Homecourt, her line of luxury home and beauty care products.",
      "\"I was thinking, God, we\u2019re home all the time. The most important thing to us is where we live. We take care of our skin, our hair. So why not care about your home in the same way?\" she said.",
      "Cox, who said she's \"involved in every part\" of Homecourt, told Rassi she's excited about the company's new Cece Body Collection, which was inspired by her signature scent.",
      "\"It's cardamom and cedar wood and cinnamon,\" said Cox. \"It's smoky and sexy.\""

    "story": [
      "Taylor Swift was inspired once again by great works of literature while writing several songs on her 12th studio album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" which dropped Oct. 3.",
      "The album kicks off with the track \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" which references William Shakespeare's tragic play \"Hamlet.\" Ophelia and Hamlet are young lovers who, because of familial and societal pressures, don't stand a chance together.",

      "The character of Ophelia is known for her gentle beauty and a passive nature that is ultimately her undoing.",
      "Her \"fate\" in Hamlet? Well, it's not a cheery one. She exhausts herself trying to please the men in her life while never addressing her own needs. Frustrated by her lack of power \u2014 and consumed with grief after Hamlet accidentally kills her father and cruelly breaks off with her \u2014\u00a0Ophelia goes mad and drowns herself.",
      "But in Swift's take on the story, she's saved from that fate by the subject of the song. In one of the opening lines, she says she \"might've drowned in the melancholy\" \u2014 much like the Shakespearean character. Rather, someone who she \"pledges allegiance to\" \"dug me out of my grave/ And saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia.\"",
      "The song's subject is seemingly a love interest, with Swift adding in the chorus, \"now you\u2019re mine.\"",
      "\u201cI have this fixation on Shakespeare characters that I love and I can\u2019t stand to see them meet a tragic demise,\" Swift said on Hits Radio. She said with \"The Fate of Ophelia\" and her earlier song \"Love Story,\" about \"Romeo and Juliet,\" she tried to flip the script.",
      "In the song, \u201cSomeone comes into your life and rescues you from the fate of being driven mad by love,\" she said on iHeart Radio.",
      "Of note, \"The Life of a Showgirl\" dropped weeks after Swift got engaged to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, whom she started dating in 2023.",
      "Swift directed a music video for \"The Fate of Ophelia,\" which will premiere in theaters Oct. 3. The video will later be available to stream on YouTube starting at 7 p.m. ET on Sunday, Oct. 5 \u2014 which will also mark Kelce's 36th birthday.",

    "summary": "How is Psycho based on the life of Ed Gein? The new show Monster shows how the two are in converasation.",
    "story": [
      "Is one of the most chilling characters in horror movie history based on a real person?",
      "Before there was Norman Bates, the knife-wielding murderer obsessed with his late mother in the seminal 1960 movie \"Psycho,\" there was Ed Gein, a killer whose crimes at his Wisconsin farm were discovered in 1957.",
      "\"The Butcher of Plainfield\" is the subject of the new Netflix series \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" which starts streaming on Oct. 3. Charlie Hunnam plays Gein, who admitted to murdering two people and was found with numerous objects made from human skin at his Wisconsin farm.",
      "\"Psycho\" was a groundbreaking film that terrified audiences with its portrayal of a human killer rather than the supernatural ghouls  who previously were the main characters in most horror movies.",
      "\"Prior to actually Ed Gein, our relationship with monsters in cinema was Dracula, Frankenstein and werewolves,\" Charlie Hunnam, who plays Gein in \u201cMonster,\u201d said on TODAY on Sept. 30. \"And 'Psycho' was the pivot point where we became the monsters, and that was all of a direct consequence of the influence that Ed Gein had had.\"",
      "Gein's life has been a catalyst for some of the most legendary horror and suspense movies of all time.",
      "\"He was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho,' Buffalo Bill in 'Silence of the Lambs' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' so he had this huge cultural influence,\" Hunnam said. \"We sort of go back and look at the inspiration behind the inspiration for those films.\"",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how Ed Gein\u2019s story played a role in the creation of \"Psycho.\"",
      "Who Was Ed Gein?",
      "Gein was raised with his brother in isolation at a Wisconsin farm in the 1920s and '30s by his domineering and fanatically religious mother,  plus a father who drank heavily and was often violent toward his children.",
      "Gein never married and lived at the family's farm in Plainfield after the death of both of his parents. In 1957, a local deputy found the decapitated body of a local missing woman, Bernice Worden, hanging in a lean-to on the side of his house.",
      "It led to the grisly discovery of preserved human heads, mummified body parts, skulls and items like lampshades and chair seats made out of human skin on Gein's property. He also confessed to killing tavern owner Mary Hogan in 1954 and said he exhumed corpses of women from local graveyards between 1944 and 1952.",
      "Is 'Psycho' Based on Ed Gein?",
      "Legendary director Alfred Hitchcock never explicitly said his 1960 movie starring Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was based on Gein's life.",
      "However, the movie is based on the 1959 horror novel \"Psycho,\" by writer Robert Bloch. The novel came out two years after Gein's crimes made headlines.",
      "Hitchcock is a character in the Netflix series and is played by \"White Lotus\" star Tom Hollander, so the connection is part of the story in \"Monster.\"",
      "Block lived 50 miles from Gein\u2019s farmhouse in Wisconsin and based his book on Gein\u2019s story, the Milwaukee Sentinel-Journal reported at the time, according to a 1984 obituary of Gein by The Associated Press.",
      "The obituary also said the movie \"Psycho\" was \"reportedly\" based on Gein's story. Gein died at 77 after spending all of his time in Wisconsin mental institutions following his arrest in 1957. Another 1984 obituary by United Press International cited Gein as the inspiration for \"Psycho.\"",
      "How is Norman Bates in 'Psycho' Similar to Ed Gein?",
      "One aspect the two clearly share is an unhealthy obsession with their mothers.",
      "Ed Gein was raised primarily on an isolated farm in Plainfield, Wisconsin, under the thumb of his domineering mother, Augusta Gein.",
      "Gein's fanatically religious mother isolated him from friends at school and drilled into him that women were immoral. Gein never married and became inseparable from his mother, worshipping her and seeking her approval.",
      "A report by Central State Hospital in Wisconsin in 1957 found that Gein, who was 51 at the time, was \u201cinordinately emotionally attached to his mother.\"",
      "\u201cAfter the death of his mother, he felt that he had a special power whereby he could raise the dead to life by an act of his will power; and when he found that this was not successful, his emotional needs influenced him to attempt the re-creation of his mother by using the parts of bodies from other graves,\u201d the report states.",
      "In the movie \"Psycho,\" a young man named Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, operates a motel in California with a side hobby as a taxidermist. Perkins makes an appearance as a character in \"Monster,\" played by Joey Pollari.",
      "Similar to Gein's farm in Plainfield, the Bates Motel is located in a remote small town.",
      "The film makes it ambiguous at first whether it's Bates or his mother who has killed a hotel guest and then a detective searching for her at the motel.",
      "In a chilling scene, the sister of a character whom Bates killed discovers the mummified body of Bates' mother in a fruit cellar. Bates then appears in women's clothes and a wig.",
      "The big reveal after Bates is caught is that he killed his mother and then kept her corpse in his home out of guilt. He developed a split personality as Bates and \"Mother,\" often holding a conversation between the two personas.",
      "Much like Gein avoiding relationships with women due to his mother's relentless harping on their immorality, Bates would hear the voice of \"Mother\" in his head whenever he was attracted to a woman.",
      "In the report by Central State Hospital, Gein told interviewers that he \"heard his mother talking to him on several occasions for about a year after she died.\u201d",
      "The theme of dressing up dead women in connection with his mother is mentioned in the report from the Wisconsin hospital. Interviewers describing his grave robbing wrote that \"it seems probable that this activity was the result of his desire to re-create the existence of his own mother,\" although Gein denied it.",
      "Sensationalizing Gein's crimes in popular movies and other creative works over decades is broached on \"Monster.\"",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s one of the questions we ask on the show is, \u2018Who is the monster?\u2019 This boy who did terrible things but had been abused and left in isolation with untreated mental health issues, or this legion of filmmakers that took inspiration from his life and sensationalized for entertainment and arguably darkened the American psyche in the process?\u201d Hunnam said on TODAY."

      "The film is inspired by the 2002 HBO documentary \u201cThe Smashing Machine: The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr.\u201d",
      "Although considered a pioneer in the MMA and UFC world, Kerr received a different type of fame and attention compared to wrestlers and WWE athletes like Johnson, aka The Rock, who became a household name.",
      "But now, years later, Kerr, 56, is having his own moment in the public eye thanks to thanks to the film named after his UFC stage name, \"The Smashing Machine.\"",

      "Kerr has been promoting the film alongside Johnson, Blunt and director Benny Safdie. During this time, he's also shared more insight into his current life.",
      "What Happened to Mark Kerr?",
      "The film ends with footage of the real-life Kerr grocery shopping in Scottsdale, Arizona. He greets the cashier, loads up his groceries, hops into his truck and departs the parking lot. This moment signals that Kerr appears to have somewhat of a normal life after years of being in the public eye as a wrestler.",
      "As shown in the film, and reflected in his real life, Kerr made his professional MMA debut on Jan. 19. 1997, competing in the heavyweight tournament as part of World Vale Tudo Championship 3. He won three of his matches, securing the tournament title.",

      "He retired from the sport in 2009, UFC notes, and was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in June 2025.",

      "He's also been an advocate for mental health, hoping to help those who struggle with addiction. He touched on his advocacy during his speech when he was inducted into the UFC Hall of Fame in July 2025.",
      "Kerr has also been doing interviews ahead of the release of \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d talking about seeing Johnson transform into his former self.",
      "\u201cI could still see him in there, but I\u2019m looking at like a mirror picture of myself and it\u2019s this experience where I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my god, man,\u2019\u201d he said during an interview on the \u201cJoe Rogan Experience\u201d podcast. \u201cLike, wow...

For the first time, I could actually see my part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, I could see my part, how f------ hard I was on the people around me, how just singularly driven I was to accomplish something at all cost. And the person that paid it the most was Dawn. She paid a heavy price.\u201d",
      "Days before the movie arrived in theaters, Sports Illustrated also released Kerr's joint interview with Johnson looking back at their careers and the film.",
      "\u201cBenny Safdie said this about you,\u201d Johnson told Kerr. \u201cI\u2019m paraphrasing here, but one of the greatest triumphs about our film is the fact that you, yourself, as a human being, as a real man, Mark Kerr, found your own authenticity and finally after all these years, you are comfortable with who you are today.\u201d"

      "\"It\u2019s too late for Swift to have a 'song of the summer,' but this feels like the Album of the Summer \u2014 the calendar be damned.

      "Wood does conceded the album will result in several hits, but laments the lyrical unsophistication.",

      "Augusta Gein is a pivotal figure whom Ed Gein told interviewers had a profound effect on his life. A report by the state of Wisconsin in the wake of Ed Gein's crimes said he was \"inordinately emotionally attached to his mother.\"",
      "Who was Augusta Gein?",
      "Augusta Gein was raised in a large family and met her husband, George Gein, Ed Gein's father, in Wisconsin when she was 19 and he was 24.",
      "The young girl grew up in a \"fanatically\" religious family and received regular beatings from her dour father for any minor infraction, according to the 1989 book \"Deviant\" by true crime writer Harold Schechter.",
      "She became a domineering, deeply religious Lutheran in the mold of her father, who was disgusted by the immorality of the world.",
      "Augusta and George Gein married in 1899, and she often derided him for his laziness and struggles with alcohol. The couple had two children \u2014 Henry, who was born in 1902, and Ed, who was born in 1906.",
      "Augusta had wanted a daughter after Henry was born and became \"bitter\" when her second child was a boy instead, according to Schechter.",
      "What was Ed Gein's childhood like with his mother?",
      "The Geins initially ran a grocery store in La Crosse, Wisconsin, but then Augusta purchased a small dairy farm in 1913 to get away from life in the city, which she considered immoral.",
      "She then bought a 195-acre farm in Plainfield, Wisconsin, in 1914, at a time when most landowners were men.",
      "The farm was six miles from the nearest village via a dirt road, so it was extremely isolated. The family lived in a modest, two-story house that became more dilapidated as the years went on because of struggles with money.",
      "Augusta often kept Ed isolated from friends at school by badmouthing their parents and urging him not to associate with them.",
      "He was teased at school for his effeminate manner and propensity for crying, which drove him closer to his mother, who rarely left the farm.",
      "Augusta also harped on the immorality of women to her two sons, who never married. She made them promise they would never be corrupted by women.",
      "George Gein died at 66 in 1940, and Ed Gein's brother, Henry, died in 1944 under mysterious circumstances.",
      "Ed and Henry Gein were fighting a fire on marshland near their home when Ed Gein said he lost his brother in the darkness and chaos of the fire. Searches found Henry Gein's body covered in soot but the body was free of burns and covered with bruises on the head, according to Schechter's book.",
      "Henry Gein's death was ruled an asphyxiation. It came in the wake of Henry Gein shocking Ed Gein by criticizing their mother about what Henry Gein believed was an overly close relationship with his younger brother.",
      "How Did Augusta Gein Die?",
      "In the wake of Henry Gein's death, she suffered a stroke that left her bedridden.",
      "It was the first time that she depended on Ed Gein for help. He waited on her hand and foot and read her passages from the Bible.",
      "She began walking again in 1945 but suffered another stroke and died at 67 on Dec. 29, 1945. Her stroke reportedly came after she saw a neighbor with a woman who was not his wife.",
      "Her siblings and Ed Gein were the only people at her funeral, according to Schechter.",
      "A dozen years after his mother's death, Ed Gein gained notoriety as The Butcher of Plainfield. Authorities discovered the decapitated body of one of his victims in a shed on his farm as well as numerous human remains in various macabre forms.",
      "What Role Did Augusta Gein Play in Ed Gein's Crimes?",
      "Ed Gein's childhood under Augusta Gein is part of the arc of the Netflix show.",
      "\"I think that's one of the questions we ask on the show is, 'Who is the monster?' This boy who did terrible things but had been abused and left in isolation with untreated mental health issues, or this legion of filmmakers that took inspiration from his life and sensationalized for entertainment and arguably darkened the American psyche in the process?\" Charlie Hunnam, who plays Gein in \"Monster,\" said on TODAY on Sept. 30.",
      "Official documents produced in interviews following his crimes, found in the book \"The Ed Gein File,\" paint a picture of Augusta Gein's heavy influence on his shocking murders and other behavior.",
      "A report by Central State Hospital in Wisconsin in 1957 found that Ed Gein, who was 51 at the time, was \"inordinately emotionally attached to his mother\" and attained his \"strict moralistic attitudes in regards to sex and drinking\" from her.",
      "While Ed Gein denied it was her influence that made him violate the graves of several women, the report concludes that \"it seems probable that this activity was the result of his desire to re-create the existence of his own mother.\"",
      "\"After the death of his mother, he felt that he had a special power whereby he could raise the dead to life by an act of his will power; and when he found that this was not successful, his emotional needs influenced him to attempt the re-creation of his mother by using the parts of bodies from other graves,\" the report states.",
      "Gein also referred to one of his victims as \"a very loose and disreputable woman,\" according to the report. It echoes much of what he was taught by his mother.",
      "He added that he \"heard his mother talking to him on several occasions for about a year after she died.\"",
      "Gein also told interviewers from the hospital that his mother was \"good in every way.\""

    "story": [
      "Japan could end up with its first female prime minister or its youngest leader in more than a century after a party leadership election on Saturday.",
      "The governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is voting for a new party leader after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced last month that he was stepping down.",
      "The winner is likely to become the new prime minister of Japan, a key U.S. ally and the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy, when parliament votes in mid-October \u2014 though it is not guaranteed since the LDP-led coalition lost its majority in both houses in the past year.",
      "Conservative nationalist Sanae Takaichi, 64, and the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi, 44, are the front-runners among the five candidates. Yoshimasa Hayashi, 64, who is currently the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, has also surged in public opinion polls and could end up on top.",
      "The new LDP leader will be selected by 295 lawmakers and almost 1 million rank-and-file party members, who will be represented by another 295 votes. The top two candidates are likely to then enter a runoff.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but right now, polls suggest that Koizumi is in the pole position,\u201d said Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus.",
      "The LDP, which has governed Japan almost uninterrupted since the end of World War II, is doing some \u201csoul-searching,\u201d Kingston said, after election losses spurred by a party corruption scandal as well as public dissatisfaction with the rising cost of living.",
      "Those who think the party hasn\u2019t done enough to root out corruption and needs a \u201creset\u201d are looking for a \u201cfresh face\u201d and to \u201chand the baton to a younger, more charismatic leader\u201d such as Koizumi, Kingston said.",
      "Koizumi, the son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, is a former environment minister but gained more prominence recently as agriculture minister when he was able to rein in runaway prices of rice, a staple Japanese food.",
      "He would be Japan\u2019s youngest leader since Hirobumi Ito, who was just a few months younger than Koizumi when he became the country\u2019s first prime minister in 1885.",
      "Others prefer Takaichi because she was an ally of assassinated former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Japan\u2019s longest-serving leader, whose wing of the LDP has been tarnished by corruption scandals.",
      "\u201cTheir view is that the LDP has to return to its DNA to be the right-wing conservative party, and that Takaichi is the one best positioned to sort of return to the glory of Abe,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Takaichi, who has a passionate hard-line conservative base among rank-and-file party members, says one of her role models is former British leader Margaret Thatcher.",
      "\u201cShe does project strength in the way that Margaret Thatcher projected strength, and she wants to be that kind of Iron Lady of Japan,\u201d said Jeffrey Hall, a special lecturer in Japanese studies at Kanda University of International Studies.",
      "But some LDP lawmakers consider Takaichi too far right, expressing concern that her nationalistic historical views could undermine relations with China, Japan\u2019s biggest trading partner.",
      "Moderate forces could unite behind another candidate to block Takaichi from winning, much as they did in last year\u2019s leadership race when she lost to Ishiba.",
      "One person who stands to benefit from that scenario is Hayashi, who like Koizumi is Ivy League-educated. Having served in almost every major cabinet post, including foreign minister, Hayashi \u201creally stands for experience and stability,\u201d Hall said.",
      "All of the candidates have talked tough on immigration, an increasingly sensitive issue in Japan, where tourists are coming in record numbers and foreign-born residents make up a growing proportion of the population as the government grapples with labor shortages.",
      "But Takaichi has taken the strongest stances, decrying the rudeness of foreign tourists and accusing them of abusing the famous deer in Nara.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s definitely appealing to the online conservatives who have very strong anti-foreign feelings,\u201d Hall said.",
      "Koizumi, Takaichi and Hayashi all have roughly the same policy toward the U.S., \u201cwhich is keeping the status quo,\u201d he said.",
      "At the moment, the U.S. relationship \u201cis a huge headache for Japan,\u201d and there are signs that the trade deal reached with President Donald Trump in July is \u201cunraveling,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "The impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs has been especially felt by Japan\u2019s crucial auto industry, including brands popular in the U.S. such as Nissan, Honda and Toyota.",
      "Last month the U.S. tariff on cars imported from Japan was lowered to 15% from 27.5%, the same rate the U.S. imposes on almost all Japanese goods under the deal, which has yet to be put in writing. But that is still considerably higher than the previous 2.5%.",
      "The tariffs were lowered in part because Japan pledged $550 billion in U.S. investment, though there are disagreements between Washington and Tokyo as to what form that investment will take and how each country will benefit.",
      "A major challenge for Japan\u2019s next leader will be implementing the trade agreement \u201cin a way that Trump will be satisfied,\u201d Hall said.",
      "\u201cWhoever becomes prime minister will continue Japan\u2019s foreign policy of flattering Trump and being as friendly as possible to Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cand not trying to have any kind of situation where they\u2019ll have open disagreement that could cause Trump to turn on Japan in any way.\u201d"

      "A comedy festival in the capital of Saudi Arabia has become a cultural flash point as major comedians face criticism for accepting seemingly lucrative deals to perform in a country that was virtually impossible to visit until 2019 and a pariah in much of the West for its human rights record.",
      "The Riyadh Comedy Festival, which began Friday and runs through Oct. 9, features a variety of big names such as Dave Chappelle, Kevin Hart, Aziz Ansari, Pete Davidson, Andrew Schulz, Jo Koy, Bill Burr, Jessica Kirson, Jimmy Carr and Louis C.K.",
      "These comedians, most of them American, are now encountering resistance from some fans, human rights advocates and fellow comics in the industry.",
      "Marc Maron, host of the \u201cWTF\u201d podcast, blasted the festival in a recent stand-up clip, joking that it was easy for him to \u201ctake the high road on this one\u201d considering he was not invited to perform.",
      "\u201cI mean, how do you even promote that?\u201d Maron said. \u201cLike, \u2018From the folks that brought you 9/11, two weeks of laughter in the desert. Don\u2019t miss it.\u2019 I mean, the same guy that\u2019s gonna pay them is the same guy that paid that guy to bone-saw Jamal Khashoggi and put him in a f---ing suitcase.\u201d",
      "The Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment. Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival in July, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",
      "Celebrities and influencers have often been criticized for performing in the country or participating in tourism campaigns, and FIFA drew condemnation last year for selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup.",
      "Shane Gillis, who said he was offered an invite, claimed that the organizers \u201cdoubled the bag,\u201d or the amount of money offered, after he declined to participate.",
      "\u201cIt was a significant bag, but I\u2019d already said no,\u201d Gillis said on his podcast. \u201cI took a principled stand.\u201d",

      "In a news release last week, Human Rights Watch wrote that the Saudi government is using the festival \u201cto deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations\u201d and called on the performers \u201cto publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",
      "These performers did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Saudi government has been censured by dozens of countries, and in 2024 it was denied a second attempt at scoring a seat on the United Nations Human Rights Council. In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private. Trump has maintained a close relationship with the crown prince throughout the Saudi royal\u2019s fraught tenure.",

      "The festival and subsequent fallout has also provided a rare window into these events and, in particular, the money and self-censorship often involved.",
      "One comedian, Atsuko Okatsuka, posted screenshots to Threads of what she said was her invite to the festival, including a section on \u201cContent Restrictions\u201d that prohibited the artists from performing material that \u201cmay be considered to degrade, defame, or bring into public disrepute, contempt, scandal, embarrassment, or ridicule\u201d the country, its royal family or any religion.",
      "\u201cA lot of the \u2018you can\u2019t say anything anymore!\u2019 Comedians are doing the festival \ud83d\ude02\u201d Okatsuka wrote. \u201cthey had to adhere to censorship rules about the types of jokes they can make.\u201d",
      "Mike Birbiglia and Leslie Liao were among the comics who responded to her post, sharing that they had rejected the offer as well.",
      "Stavros Halkias similarly revealed in a podcast episode with Distefano, who did agree to perform, that he didn\u2019t take the deal. Distefano told Halkias that while he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do it either,\u201d his fianc\u00e9e had ultimately urged him to \u201ctake that f---ing money.\u201d",
      "At least one comedian, however, appears to have changed his mind despite initially agreeing to perform. Nimesh Patel, who was slated to get on stage Sunday, posted a TikTok video over the weekend sharing that he recently canceled his appearance after \u201chaving a change of heart.\u201d That video has since become unavailable.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll just do 40 shows that I had not planned on doing here in the perfectly clean, moral, above-everyone-else, United States of America \u2014 I\u2019m tired just thinking about it \u2014 to make up for the lost bag,\u201d Patel said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m gonna get fired again from people that are not even Saudis. I\u2019m gonna get fired by people who don\u2019t chop hands off. I\u2019m gonna get fired by reasonable people. I\u2019m gonna get fired by people that don\u2019t practice Shariah law,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cThis is the most controversial the people who fire me will ever be. Let me relish in this. Let\u2019s take this win.\u201d",
      "The Saudi Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation about the cancellation of Patel\u2019s and Dillon\u2019s shows."

      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",

      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",

      "At least one of the vessels, the Mikeno, sailing under the French flag, appeared to reach just off Gaza\u2019s coast, according to the online tracker, although Global Sumud Flotilla said they had lost communication with the vessel.",

      "In an earlier video posted by the foreign ministry, Thunberg could be seen seated, wearing a keffiyeh and putting on her signature frog hat, with someone in military garb kneeling beside her.",
      "Referring to the flotilla as the \"Hamas-Sumud flotilla,\" the foreign ministry said several vessels had been stopped, with those onboard being transferred to an Israeli port. \"Greta and her friends are safe and healthy,\" it said, adding in a later post that deportation procedures to Europe were expected to begin once passengers arrived in Israel.",
      "Some 500 people have taken part in the Global Sumud Flotilla, seeking to deliver a symbolic aid package to the besieged enclave and send a message of resistance by breaking through Israel's naval blockade of the territory.",
      "Israel has maintained a land, air and sea blockade on Gaza since 2007, when Hamas seized power in the enclave.",
      "The flotilla was intercepted as Israeli forces continued their devastating assault on Gaza City, where scores of people have been killed in recent days and hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Deaths from starvation have also continued to rise, according to Palestinian health officials.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz on Wednesday said the military had completed seizing the Nitzarim corridor to Gaza\u2019s shoreline and was cutting the enclave \u201cin two from north to south.\u201d",
      "He said this was the \u201clast opportunity\u201d for Palestinians in Gaza City to move south \u2014 and that those who remain will be considered \u201cterrorists and supporters of terror\u201d as Israeli forces carry out their assault at \u201cfull strength.\u201d",
      "The world is awaiting a response from Hamas to the peace plan unveiled by President Donald Trump alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week.",
      "With global outrage mounting over Israel's assault on Gaza, the flotilla has been backed by sizable protests in the streets of European cities.",
      "The fleet has been beset by a number of incidents, including explosions, harassment by drones and jamming of communications, which activists say appeared to have been attempts to hinder the ships\u2019 movements.",
      "\u201cPrior to illegally boarding the ships, it appears as though the Israeli naval vessels intentionally damaged ship communications, in an attempt to block distress signals and stop the live-stream of their illegal boat boarding,\u201d the press office for the flotilla said in a statement.",
      "Greg Stoker, an American veteran aboard one of the boats, said around a dozen naval vessels with their transponders off had approached them while they were about 70 or 80 nautical miles from the Gaza coast.",
      "\u201cThey are currently hailing our vessels, telling us to turn off our engines and await further instructions, or our boats will be seized and we will face the consequences,\u201d Stoker, wearing a red life jacket, said in a shaky video posted on Instagram.",
      "A video posted on a Telegram media account associated with the flotilla appears to show one of its ships being sprayed with water with an on-screen caption saying the vessel is being \u201cwater canoned.\u201d Another post on the Telegram channel said one of the ships had \u201cbeen deliberately rammed at sea.\u201d",
      "Miriam Azem, the international advocacy coordinator for Adalah, the human rights organization and legal center helping represent the flotilla, said the \"aggressive tactics\" only add to the \"illegality of this interception.\"",
      "\"This interception, regardless of the way it was carried out, is unlawful. It\u2019s an abduction from the high seas, from international waters where Israel has no jurisdiction whatsoever,\" she said in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea stipulates that a state has jurisdiction only up to 12 nautical miles from its shores. In general, states don\u2019t have the right to seize ships in international waters, though armed conflict is an exception.",

    "summary": "The former British prime minister has been named by Trump as the co-head of the so-called Board of Peace to oversee Gaza's reconstruction.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Tony Blair.",
      "A political titan who remains Britain\u2019s most successful postwar leader, or a disgraced scourge of the Middle East who should never be allowed near the region again.",
      "Depending on who you speak with, the man now set for a central role in President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza could conjure either reaction.",
      "The proposal will see Blair, 72, join Trump as co-chair of a \u201cBoard of Peace\u201d \u2014 an international body that would oversee the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip after its devastation at the hands of the Israeli military.",
      "Blair won three consecutive elections between 1997 and 2005, standing down two years later having never been defeated at the ballot box.",
      "Some in Britain laud his landmark achievements such as introducing the minimum wage, pouring investment into public services and helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But for many others, his name is a byword for the Iraq War, having used flawed intelligence to defy public opposition and join President George W. Bush in the 2003 invasion that is now widely viewed as disastrous.",
      "Blair called Trump\u2019s proposal \u201cbold and intelligent,\" saying in a statement it could \"end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza.\" It brings the \"chance of a brighter and better future for its people, while ensuring Israel\u2019s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages.\"",
      "That came after Trump revealed Blair wanted to be on the board, calling him a \u201cgood man, very good man.\u201d",
      "Blair's post-Iraq career includes a stint as global Middle East envoy, but even figures within his old Labour Party conceded that the potential appointment would \u201craise some eyebrows,\u201d as its serving Health Secretary Wes Streeting told the BBC on Tuesday.",
      "Indeed, among Palestinians, the reaction \u201cis not positive, to say the least,\u201d according to H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a think tank based in London. \u201cBlair continues to be associated in the public consciousness with the Iraq War.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s a leader with \u201ca lot of baggage, obviously,\u201d agreed Michael Wahid Hanna, the U.S. program director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIt\u2019s just utterly peculiar as to what he\u2019s doing here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people are confused by that.\u201d",
      "Blair remains one of the most divisive names in British politics, despite having left the stage almost 20 years ago.",
      "He roared into public view in the 1990s, winning the Labour Party leadership contest after the sudden death of his predecessor, John Smith.",
      "He set about making radical changes, scrapping the left-wing party\u2019s commitment to public ownership and sparking a bitter debate between those who saw this as the pragmatism needed to win elections, or the abandonment of progressive values.",
      "After a historic landslide in 1997 that ousted the long-ruling Conservative Party, he set about remaking Britain with the minimum wage and Northern Ireland peace, but also in landmark laws advancing LGBTQ equality and the social safety net.",
      "None would define his legacy like following Bush into Iraq, however. Like in the United States, it still unites many conservatives and liberals in their (in some cases retroactive) opposition and revulsion.",
      "The Iraq War saw Blair\u2019s premiership end in 2007 under a cloud of anger \u2014 and, from the most vehement critics, accusations that he was a war criminal after hundreds of thousands of people died in the conflict, which was not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council or in accordance with the U.N.\u2019s founding charter.",
      "A landmark British 2016 inquiry found the basis for going to war was \u201cfar from satisfactory.\u201d After that chastening conclusion, Blair expressed \u201csorrow, regret and apology\u201d and took \u201cfull responsibility without exception or excuse\u201d for the war\u2019s tragic consequences. He said he went to war in \u201cgood faith,\u201d believing the threat of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction to be real and wanting to rid the Iraqi people of the \u201cevil\u201d of Saddam Hussein.",
      "\u201cTony Blair was extremely helpful to President Trump as he developed this plan for a durable peace, and he shares the President\u2019s vision of a better life for Israelis and Palestinians alike. He would make an exceptional addition to the Board of Peace \u2014 but first, Hamas must accept this deal to end the war,\" White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly told NBC News in a statement.",
      "Blair\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the criticism surrounding his proposed appointment.",
      "Blair's involvement with the Middle East did not end with the war.",
      "On the day he stepped down, he announced he was to become special envoy to the Quartet, a supranational group comprising the United Nations, the United States, the European Union and Russia, which sought a resolution between Israel and the Palestinians. He resigned in 2015 having made little headway.",
      "The next year, he founded the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which has grown into a behemoth of more than 800 staff in some 40 countries.",
      "The nonprofit institute has been criticized for working with authoritarian governments such as Saudi Arabia and Rwanda. Blair has previously defended his work in these countries by saying his institute focused on positive forces for change, even if those were in countries with imperfect human rights records.",
      "At the head of this institute, Blair has continued to cultivate strong networks from the Middle East to Washington and has reportedly been involved in backchannel discussions over Gaza in the past year.",
      "Whatever his credentials, the idea of Western leaders parachuting in to govern Gaza \u2014 with questions over what, if any, role Palestinians will play \u2014 makes many observers nervous.",
      "\u201cThe construct is pseudo colonial; all of these outside powers are somehow creating a new protectorate,\u201d said Hanna at the International Crisis Group. \u201cSo it\u2019s very strange and it\u2019s really not clear how that\u2019s going to work.\u201d",
      "Hellyer likened Blair\u2019s proposed role to that of the viceroys used by empires such as Britain to oversee India and other colonies.",
      "\u201cPeople who are not connected to Gaza or the West Bank or Palestine at all are going to be governing Gaza with very minimal Palestinian involvement,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Blair or no Blair, I think that that\u2019s going to be something that will be difficult to politically justify.\u201d"

    "summary": "The terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, has stoked fears among Britain's Jewish community amid a rise in antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "MANCHESTER, England \u2014 British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was shocked by Thursday\u2019s terrorist attack on a Manchester synagogue during Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Hebrew calendar.",
      "But for many British Jews, this was anything but a shock, rather the culmination of a wave of antisemitism in Britain that was rising before Hamas\u2019 terrorist attack Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel\u2019s subsequent military assault on Gaza \u2014  and has only intensified since.",
      "There has been a rise in anti-Jewish hostility in Britain that predates the attack in Israel and the Gaza war that started three years ago, according to community groups and the people suffering the first-hand effects in the United Kingdom. But the incident at the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation Synagogue in Crumpsall has brought the issue of antisemitism to the fore again \u2014 leaving many Jewish people in Britain worried for the safety of their friends and family.",
      "\u201cI just keep thinking about my children,\u201d said Josh Simons, a member of Parliament who represents the Makerfield constituency near Manchester, and whose family fled persecution in Europe for the relative safety of England around a century ago. \u201cI\u2019ve got two young kids and I think everybody in this community will be holding their children tonight that little bit closer.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News on Thursday that the community was feeling \u201cfrightened, scared and hurt.\u201d",
      "Two men, Adrian Daulby, 53, and Melvin Cravitz, 66, were killed during the attack on the synagogue.",
      "Greater Manchester Police said Friday that one of them suffered a wound as armed officers attempted to shoot the attacker, Jihad Al-Shamie, who drove into a group of people before stabbing a man. Al-Shamie did not have a firearm. But for many in the Jewish community the attack, which also left three people injured, was the culmination of something that had been festering for some time.",
      "\u201cThis is the day we hoped we would never see, but which deep down, we knew would come,\u201d Britain\u2019s chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, also said in a statement. \u201cFor so long we have witnessed an unrelenting wave of Jew hatred on our streets, on campuses, on social media and elsewhere \u2014 this is the tragic result,\u201d he added.",
      "Since Israel launched its military offensive in the wake of the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on the country, there has been a spike in antisemitic incidents in Britain, according to the Community Security Trust, a charity that coordinates security measures at Jewish institutions and tracks this data. The group defines antisemitism as \u201chatred, bigotry, prejudice or discrimination against Jews,\u201d on its website.",
      "That year, 2023, saw 4,103 antisemitic incidents reported to the CST \u2014 the most on record \u2014 and last year\u2019s 3,528 was the second highest. Swastikas and other graffiti have been daubed on synagogues and other sites, and security has been heightened at Jewish schools.",
      "In the space of a week last month, urine and feces were smeared over seven synagogues and a children\u2019s nursery in Golders Green, a part of north London known for its large Jewish population. \u201cThese repeated attacks have left our community anxious, hurt and increasingly worried,\u201d a spokesperson for the local Shomrim community Jewish patrol group said at the time.",
      "In May, a Jewish-owned business in nearby Stamford Hill, which has a large Orthodox Jewish community, was daubed in red paint and had its windows smashed. Graffiti alleged the firm had links to an Israeli arms manufacturer, but traumatized staff there said this wasn\u2019t the case.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that the number of attacks has increased since the Gaza conflict,\u201d Graham Stringer, another member of Parliament serving Blackley and Middleton, another constituency close to Manchester, said  in an interview Friday. \u201cThe Jewish community has been angry and frightened and so, incidentally, has the Muslim community.\u201d",
      "There was an increase in religious hate crimes targeted against Muslims since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas conflict, with 3,866 offenses in the year leading up to March 2024, according to the latest government data. This was up 13% from 3,432 recorded the previous year, the data showed.",
      "Perhaps this is why the 2025 Jewish Landscape Report, an annual global survey, found that 81% of respondents in Britain felt the need to conceal their Jewishness in public.",
      "In a febrile atmosphere, Starmer is now under pressure to reassure British Jews \u2014 who make up just 290,000 of Britain\u2019s 70-million population, according to the last census in 2021 \u2014 that they are safe.",
      "He said Thursday he would do \u201ceverything in my power to guarantee you the security that you deserve, starting with a more visible police presence, protecting your community.\u201d",
      "The necessity of that was evident hours after the incident in Manchester, when two cars drove past the scene displaying Palestinian flags, while some men in balaclavas could be heard muttering about \u201cJews\u201d, according to a Reuters journalist at the scene.",
      "Other observers were dismayed to see pro-Palestinian marches going ahead Thursday evening in Manchester, London and other cities.",
      "There have been regular marches and protests in cities across the country about Israel\u2019s conduct during the war, which will enter its third year Tuesday. Among the crowds, which have on occasion contained tens of thousands, there have been displays of violent antisemitic sentiment, as well as language that conflates enmity toward Israel, Zionism and Jews themselves.",
      "On Friday, protesters said they were supporting an urgent cause, specifically the aid flotilla that was intercepted by the Israeli military en route to Gaza.",
      "But for others \u2014 both in and outside the Jewish community \u2014 it was disappointing not to have a pause in the demonstrations that have often been interpreted as hostile by British Jews.",
      "\u201cI do think that carrying on in this way does feel un-British, it feels wrong,\u201d Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood told the BBC. \u201cIt is important to draw a line between what is happening in the Middle East and what is happening at home.\u201d"

      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Friday that King Charles had approved the nomination of Sarah Mullally, bishop of London, for the church\u2019s most senior position. She will be installed in a service at Canterbury Cathedral in March 2026.",
      "Mullally is the first female Archbishop of Canterbury to be chosen since women were allowed to become bishops in 2014.",
      "As the spiritual leader of the Church of England, the Archbishop of Canterbury heads a global Anglican community of around 85 million people across 165 countries.",
      "In a statement following her appointment, Mullally said: \u201cAs I respond to the call of Christ to this new ministry, I do so in the same spirit of service to God and to others that has motivated me since I first came to faith as a teenager.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt every stage of that journey, through my nursing career and Christian ministry, I have learned to listen deeply \u2014 to people and to God\u2019s gentle prompting \u2014 to seek to bring people together to find hope and healing.\u201d",
      "Mullally became the first female bishop of London in 2018, having first been ordained in 2001. Before joining the church, she had been a specialist cancer nurse, rising to become the government\u2019s youngest chief nursing officer for England at the age of 37.",

      "She will become the 106th Archbishop of Canterbury since St.  Augustine was sent by Pope Gregory to convert the English people to Roman Christianity in 597.",
      "Starmer welcomed Mullally\u2019s appointment, saying she would play \u201ca key role in our national life.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Church of England is of profound importance to this country. Its churches, cathedrals, schools, and charities are part of the fabric of our communities,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In an address following her appointment, Mullally said that \u201cin the apparent chaos which surrounds us, in the midst of such profound global uncertainty, the possibility of healing lies in acts of kindness and love.\u201d",
      "She added that Thursday\u2019s attack on a synagogue in Manchester showed that Church of England members \u201chave a responsibility to be a people who stand with the Jewish community against antisemitism in all its forms. Hatred and racism of any kind cannot be allowed to tear us apart.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 Prince William has said \u201cchange is on my agenda\u201d and admitted to being overwhelmed by family stress in an unusually candid interview.",
      "William was speaking with Canadian actor and comedian Eugene Levy in Windsor for Levy\u2019s Apple TV+ travel series, \u201cThe Reluctant Traveler.\u201d",
      "Asked if the monarchy would be shifting in a different direction when he becomes king, the Prince of Wales said: \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that change is on my agenda. Change for good, and I embrace that and I enjoy that change. I don\u2019t fear it, that\u2019s the bit that excites me is the idea of being able to bring some change.\u201d",
      "William, heir to the throne currently held by King Charles, did not offer any specific changes he would be interested in making and said he did not want \u201coverly radical change,\u201d but said that \u201cif you\u2019re not careful, history can be a real weight and an anchor around you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s very important that tradition stays, and tradition has a huge part in all of this,\u201d he said in a clip from the upcoming episode. \u201cBut there\u2019s also points where you look at tradition and go, is that still fit for purpose today? Is that still the right thing to do? Are we still doing and having the most impact we could be having?\u201d",

      "Asked how his three children \u2014 George, 12, Charlotte, 10, and Louis, 7 \u2014 have been coping with their mother\u2019s cancer, which is now in remission, William said: \u201cEveryone has their own coping mechanisms for these sorts of things, and children are constantly learning and adapting. We try to make sure we give them the security and the safety that they need. And we\u2019re a very open family, so we talk about things that bother us, and things that trouble us, but you never quite know the knock-on effects that it can have.\u201d",
      "William, who has historically been more averse to the media spotlight than his younger brother, Harry, also discussed how his experience of \u201cinsatiable\u201d media intrusion around his mother, the late Princess Diana, during his childhood has shaped the way he handles the press.",
      "\u201cThey wanted every bit of detail they could absorb, and they were in everything, literally everywhere. They would know things, they\u2019d be everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you let that creep in, the damage it can do to your family life is something that I vowed would never happen to my family.\u201d"

      "After Trump publicly clashed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the Oval Office, the United States suspended intelligence-sharing with Kyiv in March for about a week. The suspension rattled Ukraine\u2019s government and European allies because Kyiv heavily relies on American intelligence for its war effort.",

      "More than 1,000 silver and gold coins collectively valued at about $1 million were recovered from an 18th-century shipwreck off the coast of Florida, a shipwreck salvage company said.",
      "The company, 1715 Fleet Queens Jewels, LLC, stated in a news release that it recovered the coins in July off the southeastern region of the state, the so-called Treasure Coast.",
      "The discovery is allegedly part of the $400 million worth of gold, silver and jewels lost by the Spanish fleet during a hurricane in 1715, the company said.",
      "\"This discovery is not only about the treasure itself, but the stories it tells,\u201d Sal Guttuso, the company's director of operations, said in the news release. \"Each coin is a piece of history, a tangible link to the people who lived, worked, and sailed during the Golden Age of the Spanish Empire.\"",
      "\"Finding 1,000 of them in a single recovery is both rare and extraordinary,\" he added.",
      "1715 Fleet Queens Jewels stated that the coins \u2014 known as pieces of eight \u2014 were minted in the Spanish colonies of Mexico, Peru, and Bolivia. The company added that many of them still bear visible dates and mint marks, \"making them important to historians and collectors alike.\"",
      "\"The condition of the coins suggests they were part of a single chest or shipment that spilled when the ship broke apart in the hurricane\u2019s fury,\" the press release added.",
      "Guttuso said in a phone call on Thursday that the coins were found scattered in a concentrated area deep in the sand. He added that the coins are believed to have once been in a container, as some of them bear the pattern of a burlap sack imprinted on them.",
      "\"We think they would have had these things in wooden boxes,\" he said, \"and that makes sense because the wooden box degrades in the ocean and, once the box degrades, the sack degrades and the only thing that's left are these silver coins.\"",
      "He added that one of the items found along with the coins is a royal lead seal bearing the impression of Philip II of Spain, who ruled in the mid-to-late 1500s.",
      "\"You can almost assume that this was a family heirloom,\" he said. \"This lead seal probably had an important document around it that may have given that family title to lands or positions.\"",
      "1715 Fleet Queens Jewels \u2014 which claims to own the exclusive salvage rights to the remains of the 1715 treasure fleet \u2014 stated that the recovered coins will undergo careful conservation before being displayed to the public, and that plans are underway for select pieces to be exhibited at local museums.",
      "\"Every find helps piece together the human story of the 1715 fleet,\" Guttuso said. \"We are committed to preserving and studying these artifacts so future generations can appreciate their historical significance.\"",
      "The U.S. District Court of Florida and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' office did not immediately return requests for comment on the discovery."

Out of the 400,000 H-1B visas approved in the 2024 financial year, 71% of the grantees were born in India, according to the Department of Homeland Security. China was a distant second at less than 12%.",

      "Jane Goodall, a renowned researcher who documented the behavior and social lives of chimpanzees and later became a leader of the animal conservation movement, died Wednesday.",
      "Goodall was 91. She died of natural causes while she was in California as part of a speaking tour, the Jane Goodall Institute announced in a statement.",
      "\"Dr. Goodall\u2019s discoveries as an ethologist revolutionized science, and she was a tireless advocate for the protection and restoration of our natural world,\" the statement said.",
      "Goodall, who was born in Britain, became famous first for her pioneering work with chimpanzees in Tanzania in the 1960s. She fastidiously documented how the animals lived and interacted in research that would continue over several decades.",
      "She took an \u201cunorthodox approach\u201d to her research of chimpanzees, according to the foundation,  by \u201cimmersing herself in their habitat and their lives to experience their complex society as a neighbor rather than a distant observer.\u201d",
      "Goodall published a study showing that chimps used sticks as tools to fish for termites, which challenged the prevailing idea that humans were the only species capable of using tools. She also documented the animals' communication abilities and complex social behaviors, and she helped establish that they eat meat and sometimes fight with one another.",
      "\"She really established all these fundamentals on chimpanzee behavior we\u2019ve been able to elaborate on in these past few decades,\" said Elodie Freymann, a primatologist who is a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University.",
      "Robert Seyfarth, a professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania who studied primate behavior, said Goodall's death \"marks the end of an era.\"",
      "\u201cHer careful, detailed observation and reports really got a whole generation of us \u2014 me included \u2014 and many others interested in this as a field of scientific endeavor,\u201d Seyfarth said.",
      "He said Goodall was among the first researchers to make close observations of chimpanzees as individuals with personalities and quirks, at a time when other scientists were not trained to observe such specific details.",
      "\"Her perceptions of the emotions of chimpanzees was pathbreaking,\" he said, adding that Goodall was an \"honest chronicler\" of the species' behavior \u2014 both of the ways they cared for one another and of their fighting and killing.",
      "\"Her agenda was to have people understand chimpanzees in all their complexity,\" Seyfarth said.",
      "As Goodall's career progressed and she saw how habitat destruction and illegal trafficking threatened the survival of chimpanzees, she made conservation and animal welfare a focus of her work.",
      "As the Jane Goodall Institute, which she founded in 1977, put it, Goodall \u201cwent into the forest to study the remarkable lives of chimpanzees \u2014 and she came out of the forest to save them.\u201d",
      "Ingrid Newkirk, founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said in a statement that Goodall helped the organization \"end the confinement of chimpanzees locked in barren, solid metal chambers for experiments.\"",
      "Goodall was just 26 when she visited Tanzania for the first time to study chimpanzees. She began her career without scientific training, after Louis Leakey, a prominent Kenyan-British anthropologist, hired her to record her observations of chimpanzees. Goodall would later receive a doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge.",
      "In an interview on the podcast \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d this year, Goodall told host Alex Cooper that her first expedition was on a shoestring budget funded by a philanthropist.",
      "Goodall had six months of funding, and the first four months were fruitless as the primates were too skittish to allow her to get close enough for observation. But one of the animals finally adjusted to her presence long enough for her to make the breakthrough discovery that chimpanzees create and use tools.",
      "\u201cThe reason why this was so exciting was because, at that time, it was thought by Western science that only humans used and made tools. We were defined as man, the toolmaker,\u201d Goodall recalled. \u201cAnd so when I wrote to my mentor, Louis Leakey, he was just so excited.\u201d",
      "That discovery piqued the interest of \u2014 and funding from \u2014 National Geographic and ultimately changed the course of Goodall\u2019s career.",
      "As Goodall became a prominent figure, she used her celebrity to advance animal causes and public interest in science. She wrote dozens of books about her interactions with chimpanzees, including many children's books.",
      "Freymann, the primatologist, recalled dressing up as Goodall for Halloween in the fourth grade. Later, as a 19-year-old intern at the Jane Goodall Institute in Washington, D.C., she read through piles fan mail from children, she said.",
      "\"I'm a primatologist because I had a hero I could look up to,\" said Freymann, who is now 29. \"She encouraged my entire generation to go out and do it. ... She set the course of my entire life professionally and the values I believe in.\"",

      "U.S.-China relations have been strained in Trump\u2019s second term by an ongoing trade war, technological competition and differences over wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Trump said last month after a phone call with Chinese President Xi Jinping that the two leaders would meet at the Oct. 31-Nov. 1 APEC summit in South Korea and that he would go to China early next year.",
      "In a survey of the Chinese public published this month by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and the Carter Center, only 17% of respondents said the United States was a friend to China \u2014 the lowest percentage of any country they were asked about \u2014 while 83% said it was not.",
      "Chen, a former marketing manager who has never set foot in the United States, said he learned English on his own. He credits years of watching U.S. TV series, including the Trump-starring reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d for his near-native accent.",
      "\u201cIf you want to be good at doing him, you should watch the good imitators, because they kind of exaggerate his traits,\u201d Chen said over a lunch of Chongqing noodles.",
      "\u201cIf you were to rank me, I would not make top 10, but I\u2019m the only Asian Trump and the only Chinese Trump. So that\u2019s making me special!\u201d",
      "Leaving politics aside, Trump is a \u201cfunny guy\u201d and an \u201centertainer,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI like when he said: \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019 It\u2019s quite entertaining. I think his acting skills are so much better than mine.\u201d",
      "Chen watches the news to hone his technique, but he steers clear of anything political. In a country with many sensitivities and watchful censors, he prefers to use his platform to teach foreigners about Chinese food, travel and culture.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not interested in politics, actually,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThe initial reason that I wanted to do Trump is because I think it\u2019s funny. I want to make people laugh.\u201d",
      "His all but flawless impression of Trump has gained him millions of Chinese followers, some of whom stop him on the street to ask for selfies and advice about learning English.",
      "Chen is increasingly recognized by people from outside China, as well.",
      "\u201cOh, I think I know you, you\u2019re the Trump,\u201d Vadim Mitko, a 20-year-old from Russia, said when he encountered Chen on a Chongqing street.",
      "\u201cI was thinking, Chongqing is so far away from the USA, how is this guy speaking with that accent?\u201d Mitko said of the videos he had seen on TikTok.",
      "Chen, who is considering making his first trip to the United States, said that he had never thought about meeting Trump in person but that if he had the chance, he would tell Trump to visit China.",
      "\u201cYou should come to Chongqing,\u201d Chen said in Trump\u2019s voice, to try the city\u2019s famously spicy hotpot.",
      "\u201cYou say you\u2019re a tough guy,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe you should try extra hot.\u201d",
      "Janis Mackey Frayer and Dawn Liu reported from Chongqing and Peter Guo from Hong Kong."

    "story": [
      "More than 150 American doctors, nurses and other medical workers who volunteered in Gaza over the past nearly two years called on the Trump administration Wednesday to end its support for Israel's war in the besieged enclave.",
      "In a letter addressed to President Donald Trump and shared exclusively with NBC News, the 152 American health workers described their experiences and called on the administration to end the U.S.\u2019 \u201cmilitary, economic and diplomatic support\u201d for Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThis is the right thing to do, and we believe it is required under both American and international law,\u201d says the letter from doctors who have volunteered in Gaza with organizations including M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res, or Doctors Without Borders, MedGlobal and the International Medical Corps.",
      "Dr. Feroze Sidhwa, a trauma surgeon based in Stockton, California, who organized the letter, said in a phone interview: \u201cEverybody that goes over there is horrified by what they see. And you know, most of us know that it\u2019s mostly American weapons that are being used.\u201d",
      "According to health officials in the enclave, Israeli forces have killed more than 65,000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and about 250 were taken hostage.",
      "The U.S. approved at least $17.9 billion in security assistance for Israeli military operations in Gaza and elsewhere from Oct. 7, 2023, through September 2024, according to estimates from Brown University\u2019s Costs of War Project.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very strange to know that your government is sending the weapons that you\u2019re pulling out of kids\u2019 faces,\u201d Sidhwa said, noting the U.S.\u2019 role as Israel\u2019s closest ally and biggest arms supplier.",
      "The letter, which was sent to Trump\u2019s office Wednesday by email and physically mailed the same day, comes two days after the president unveiled a peace plan alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he said could end the war in Gaza and lead to the release of hostages.",
      "Hamas has signaled it will respond to the peace plan soon. If the group, which has run Gaza since 2007, rejects it, Trump warned, Israel would have U.S. backing to \u201cfinish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas.\u201d",
      "Dr. Kathleen Gallagher, a general and acute care surgeon in Grand Forks, North Dakota, who signed the letter, left Gaza a few days ago after having spent more than three weeks there. Gallagher, an Army veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who has also worked in Ukraine, said that what she witnessed in Gaza was \u201cfar and above the worst, just the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d",
      "Nothing prepared her for \u201cjust the absolute scale of destruction\u201d and the \u201cscope of the displacement,\u201d she said. Malnutrition appeared widespread, while every day Nasser Hospital, where she spent most of time, was flooded with the wounded and the dead.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza spiraled this past year under Israel\u2019s offensive and aid blockade, with the world\u2019s leading authority on hunger declaring famine in areas of the enclave\u2019s north in August.",
      "Gallagher said nearly half of the patients she treated were gunshot victims. She added almost all of them had been struck while seeking aid.",
      "Those shot were \u201cdisproportionately young males\u201d with injuries often including single shots to the head and \u201clots of very accurate neck shots.\u201d",
      "In one case, she said, a 6-month-old girl was brought to the facility after having been as her mother tried to get aid. The baby did not survive.",
      "Gallagher said around 45% of the patients she saw had suffered \u201cexplosive injuries.\u201d",
      "Dr. Thaer Ahmad, an emergency physician, who also signed the letter, said doctors and other medical workers spent the past nearly two years treating patients with a health care system under relentless attack \u2014 and with scarce supplies with limited aid coming in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to serve their people in just this absolutely heroic way, but they\u2019ve been targeted this entire time,\u201d he said in a phone interview.",
      "None of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals are fully functioning, with 14 providing partial services, according to World Health Organization data. Meanwhile, the wider health system, including ambulances and field hospitals, has been attacked more than 780 times, with more than 1,500 health workers killed, according to the United Nations.",
      "Israel says Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, including as \u201ccommand and control\u201d hubs, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so, while humanitarian groups and the U.N., have said Israel has not provided sufficient evidence to substantiate its claims.",
      "The letter\u2019s signers also said they had never seen \u201cany type of Palestinian militant activity\u201d in Gaza\u2019s hospitals or other health care facilities during their combined more than 460 weeks working within the health system. Sidhwa said he was aware of just one U.S. doctor having treated someone who appeared to be a combatant at one point but said that did not suggest activity within the hospital.",
      "Sidhwa, who also organized multiple letters to the Biden administration, said he was hopeful the voices of more than 150 American medical workers who have experienced Israel\u2019s offensive on the ground would have some impact on the Trump administration, despite Washington\u2019s stalwart support for Israel and its offensive.",
      "\u201cMost of the doctors that come back think it\u2019s traumatic,\u201d Sidhwa said. \u201cBut for me, it\u2019s not the death and the guts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really just knowing that we\u2019re responsible for it.\u201d"
