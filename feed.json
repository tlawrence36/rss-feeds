Jamison had star turns in two of Ailey's signature dances, \u201cRevelations\u201d and \u201cCry.\u201d She danced with the Ailey company for 15 years before leaving to perform on Broadway and as a guest artist with other ballet companies.",
      "Jamison later returned to the Ailey company as its artistic director for 20 years. She is widely credited with helping to make it one of the most successful dance companies in the U.S.",
      "As a dancer, choreographer, director and speaker, her distinguished career leaped over barriers of race and gender.",
      "\u201cShe was a unique, spectacular dancer who was majestic and queenly. She danced with eloquence and integrity,\u201d Sylvia Waters, Ailey II Artistic Director Emerita, said Saturday following the new of Jamison's death.",
      "\u201cTo dance with her and to be in her sphere of energy was mesmerizing,\u201d Waters said. \u201cI was fortunate to perform with her and she set the bar very, very high.\u201d",
      "Jamison's directorship of the Ailey theater \u201csustained the company and helped it to grow. She was an eloquent speaker, strong leader and ran a tight ship,\" Waters said.",
      "Striking images of Jamison including photos, video and a sculpture are currently displayed at an exhibition about the work of the Ailey company at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.",
      "Jamison was awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in 1999. Other honors included the National Medal of Arts and the Handel Medallion, the highest cultural award from New York City.",

      "Actor Tony Todd, known for his haunting portrayal of a killer in the horror film \u201cCandyman\u201d and roles in many other films and television shows, has died, his longtime manager confirmed. He was 69.",
      "Todd died Wednesday at his home in the Los Angeles area, his manager Jeffrey Goldberg said in a statement to The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI had the privilege to have Tony as my friend and client for over 30 years and I will miss that amazing man every single day,\u201d Goldberg said.",
      "\u201cKnown worldwide for his towering presence, both physically and artistically, Tony leaves behind an indelible legacy in film, theater, and the hearts of those who had the honor of knowing him,\" Goldberg's management company said in announcing the death.",

      "In \u201cCandyman,\u201d released in 1992 and followed by a remake in 2021, Todd played a menacing killer who had a hook on one arm. The premise is built around an urban myth that Candyman roamed the Cabrini-Green housing projects in Chicago and could be summoned by saying his name five times in front of a mirror. The 2021 movie explores societal problems such as racism and police brutality.",

      "\u201cThose who knew him will remember his warm laugh, generous spirit, and his dedication to his craft,\u201d the company said. \u201cWhether on stage, on screen, or in personal conversations, Tony brought an unyielding honesty that resonated deeply with his friends, family, and fans.\u201d",

      "The first episode of \u201cSaturday Night Live\" since the election of Donald Trump struck a somber tone at the beginning",
      "The first \u201cSaturday Night Live\" since Donald Trump's election victory began with the most somber of tones as a group of plainly dressed cast members, primarily women and minorities, described their new reality.",
      "\u201cTo many people, including many people watching right now, the results were shocking and even horrifying,\u201d Ego Nwodim soberly said.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump, who forcibly tried to overturn the results of the last election, was returned to office,\u201d Heidi Gardner said.",
      "\u201cAnd now,\" Bowen Yang added, \"thanks to the Supreme Court, there are no guardrails.\u201d",
      "Then came the swerve from the liberal-leaning show.",
      "\u201cThat is why we at \u2018SNL\u2019 would like to say to Donald Trump, we have been with you all along,\" Keenan Thompson said.",
      "Yang chimed in, \u201cWe have never wavered in our support for you, even when others doubted you.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery single person on this stage believed in you,\u201d Sarah Sherman said.",
      "Marcello Hern\u00e1ndez added, \u201cEvery single person on this stage voted for you.\u201d",
      "The cast members went on to effusively declare their reverence for, and obedience to, the former and future president, introducing a new character, \u201cHot, Jacked Trump.\u201d",
      "Cast member James Austin Johnson, who plays a dead-on Trump and was virtually guaranteed a long-term job by the election, came out as an Adonis-bodied president-elect.",
      "\u201cFrom now on we\u2019re going to do a very flattering portrayal of Trump, because frankly he\u2019s my hero,\" Johnson said in his Trump voice but speaking as himself. \u201cHe\u2019s going to make an incredible president and eventually king.\u201d",
      "The episode, hosted by standup comic and actor Bill Burr, was the first all season that did not begin with former cast member Maya Rudolph, who played Vice President Kamala Harris in a giddy five-week run culminating with an appearance last week of Harris herself that began the show's 50th season and brought a ratings spike.",
      "Burr, hosting after standup Dave Chappelle hosted the last two post-presidential election episodes, did his own feint in his monologue, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t watch politics\u201d and doing some standard standup including an airplane bit before doubling back to the elephant in the studio, the election.",
      "\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get to what you all want to talk about. Alright ladies, you\u2019re 0-and-2 against this guy,\" he said. \"But you learn more from your losses than your wins. So let\u2019s get into the game tape. Ladies, enough with the pantsuit. Okay, it\u2019s not working. Stop trying to have respect for yourself.\u201d",
      "He suggested candidates that were a least a little more scantily clad, saying, \u201cI know a lot of ugly women \u2014 feminists, I mean \u2014 don\u2019t want to hear this message.\u201d",
      "Burr was \u201cso psyched that this stupid election is finally over. Everybody knew who they were going to vote for four years ago. Then they just dragged us through a year and a half of this stuff,\u201d he said.",
      "After Trump's first election victory in 2016, the show opening was serious and stayed that way with Kate McKinnon, who played Hillary Clinton on the show, appearing as the losing candidate sitting at the piano and singing a somber version Leonard Cohen's \u201cHallelujah,\u201d changing only one verse from the best-known versions of the song.",
      "\u201cAnd even though it all went wrong, I'll stand before the lord of song with nothing on my tongue but \u2018Hallelujah,'\u201d McKinnon sang in what became a national moment of catharsis for those on the losing side.",
      "After finishing, McKinnon said in a shaky voice, \u201cI'm not giving up and neither should you\" before delivering the obligatory \u201clive from New York, it's Saturday night!\u201d",
      "Rudolph made no appearance as Harris on this Saturday night, but former cast member Dana Carvey, who has played President Joe Biden all season, showed up as a leaping Elon Musk after the cast said they loved him, too.",
      "After the opening, the sketches downshifted into standard, non-election \u201cSNL\u201d fare, except of course for the fake news \u201cWeekend Update.\u201d",
      "\u201cOn Tuesday, we learned that Democrats don\u2019t actually know how to rig an election,\" faux co-anchor Colin Jost said.",
      "He later added, \u201cIf I know Democrats, they\u2019re going to take a long look in the mirror, learn from their mistakes and run Biden again in 2028.\u201d",
      "Co-anchor Michael Che, who is Black, drank throughout the segment, saying he couldn\u2019t believe people convinced him Harris could win over rural Pennsylvanians.",
      "\u201cClearly I\u2019ve been spending too much time with you white liberals and your goofy optimism,\u201d Che said."

      "In their new court filing, lawyers for Combs say they are proposing a \u201cfar more robust\u201d bail package that would subject the entertainer to strict around-the-clock security monitoring and near-total restrictions on his ability to contact anyone but his lawyers. But the amount of money they attach to the package remains $50 million, as they proposed before.",
      "They also cite new evidence that they say \u201cmakes clear that the government's case is thin.\u201d That evidence, the lawyers said, refutes the government's claim that a March 2016 video showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend occurred during a coerced \u201cfreak off,\u201d a sexually driven event described in the indictment against Combs.",
      "They wrote that the encounter was instead \u201ca minutes-long glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\u201d between Combs and his then-girlfriend.",
      "The lawyers argued that the jail conditions Combs is experiencing at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn violate his constitutional rights to participate in his defense.",

      "It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show",
      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",
      "\u201cWhat this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\" he said outside court.",
      "Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court."

      "The Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art, or Dak\u2019Art, has opened in the Senegalese capital",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A whirlwind of color and art at the opening of this year's Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art in the Senegalese capital stood in stark contrast to the serious topic of slavery featuring in the artworks of guest artists from the United States.",
      "The U.S. exhibit showcases seven African American artists whose works examine the past, present and future repercussions of slavery. It's part of the international festival held every other year and known as Dak\u2019Art.",
      "Traditional \u201cboubous,\u201d wide-sleeved robes worn across West Africa, mixed with black suits and ties at the opening Thursday in Dakar, the capital of Senegal.",
      "The exhibition, founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government to promote the continent's thriving art scene, has over the years become one of the most important among African artists.",
      "This year's theme, \u201cThe Wake,\u201d has 58 artists from 33 countries exploring various meanings and evocations of the term, such as exhumation, mourning and uprooting, according to the organizers.",
      "The central idea behind it is to link the past and the future by giving them equal importance, Salimata Diop, Dak\u2019Art\u2019s artistic director said in a statement distributed to the media.",
      "The United States was the guest of honor of this year\u2019s show.",
      "The work of African American artists explored cultural beliefs about the afterlife held by Lebou, one of Senegal's ethnic groups. The Lebou believe that in the afterlife, spirits dwell eternally in the ocean.",
      "There was also an entire new alphabet depicted on the curly hair pattern of African hair, as well as an immersive exhibit attempting to let viewers experience what it might have felt like to be a slave and be thrown into the water.",
      "The wake of slavery impacted all Americans, said Diana Baird N\u2019Diaye, the show's curator. She is based between the U.S. and Senegal. The displayed art does not only relate to the past, but also looks towards the future, she added.",
      "\u201cWe are here because they (our ancestors) survived slavery in America,\" she said. \u201cWe are here because our ancestors, our grandparents survived Jim Crow.\u201d",
      "\"And now we are at another crucial moment,\u201d Baird N\u2019Diaye said.",
      "The Dak'Art comes as several countries in the region are stepping away from traditional Western allies and turning towards new partners, such as Russia and China, with a less complicated history in the region.",
      "In a region rocked in recent years by coups and extremist violence, Senegal has managed to maintain its reputation as a stable democracy. Still, Senegal's ruling party, which is facing an election next week, has pledged to review its relationship with Western countries, but so far has not made any radical decisions.",
      "Khady Di\u00e8ne Gaye, Senegal's minister of youth, sports and culture, told reporters that the U.S. role as the guest of honor is \u201ca display of the importance of art as a tool for dialogue between peoples, the promotion of peace, mutual understanding, but most importantly as a tool for economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The Dak\u2019Art runs until Dec. 7. Originally scheduled for May, it was postponed following political tensions around the April presidential election and funding issues that the new authorities blamed on the former administration."

She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",

      "Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each.",
      "Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s new age, alt-jazz \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier\u2019s \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d respectively, as well as Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d and Charli XCX\u2019s rave-ready \u201cBRAT.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting,\u201d says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible.\u201d",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3.",

      "Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination.",

There are also only four entries in the best M\u00fasica Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres.",

      "Argentine prosecutors say that three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month",
      "BUENOS AIRES -- Three people have been charged in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction who died after falling from the balcony of his hotel room in Buenos Aires last month, Argentine prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "Prosecutor Andr\u00e9s Madrea charged the three suspects, whose identities were not revealed, with \u200b\u200bthe crimes of \u201cabandonment of a person followed by death\u201d and \u201csupplying and facilitating the use of narcotics,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said. Madrea also requested their arrest to judge Laura Bruniard, who ruled the three cannot leave the country.",
      "Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo, in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding.",
      "Prosecutors also said that Payne\u2019s toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\u201d in the moments before his death.",
      "Investigators said hours after Payne\u2019s death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between Oct. 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer.",
      "The charges in Payne\u2019s case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor\u2019s personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic.",
      "Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018.",
      "Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cell phone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer\u2019s personal computer \u2013 which is damaged \u2013 and other devices that were seized.",
      "Payne\u2019s autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne committing suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",
      "The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan\u2019s concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.",

    "summary": "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
    "story": [
      "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
      "Megan Park feels a little bad that her movie is making so many people cry. It's not just a single tear either \u2014 more like full body sobs.",
      "She didn\u2019t set out to make a tearjerker with \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d now streaming on Prime Video. She just wanted to tell a story about a young woman in conversation with her older self. The film is quite funny (the dialogue between 18-year-old and almost 40-year-old Elliott happens because of a mushroom trip that includes a Justin Bieber cover), but it packs an emotional punch, too.",
      "Writing, Park said, is often her way of working through things. When she put pen to paper on \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d she was a new mom and staying in her childhood bedroom during the pandemic. One night, she and her whole nuclear family slept under the same roof. She didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the last time, and she started wondering what it would be like to have known that.",
      "In the film, older Elliott ( Aubrey Plaza ) advises younger Elliott ( Maisy Stella ) to not be so eager to leave her provincial town, her younger brothers and her parents and to slow down and appreciate things as they are. She also tells her to stay away from a guy named Chad who she meets the next day and discovers that, unfortunately, he's quite cute.",
      "At 38, Park is just getting started as a filmmaker. Her first, \u201cThe Fallout,\u201d in which Jenna Ortega plays a teen in the aftermath of a school shooting, had one of those pandemic releases that didn\u2019t even feel real. But it did get the attention of Margot Robbie \u2019s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, who reached out to Park to see what other ideas she had brewing.",
      "\u201cThey were very instrumental in encouraging me to go with it,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey\u2019re just really even-keeled, good people, which makes them great producers. They treat everybody the same, which is the vibe that I like. There\u2019s no ego, there\u2019s no hierarchy.\u201d",
      "LuckyChap even empowered her to cast Stella first and to build it out around her. In a more traditional setting, she said, you have to start with the most famous person.",
      "Park came to writing and directing after some 20 years of acting. The product of a small town in Canada (Lindsay, Ontario), she knew she loved the arts but had no connections to the industry. The only job she could imagine for herself was actor, she said. Luckily, she had some success at it, with roles in films (\"Charlie Bartlett\u201d) and television shows like \u201cLife with Derek\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d (she was Grace, the conservative cheerleader). It was on that show that she met one of her dearest friends, Shailene Woodley, and started to realize that perhaps acting wasn\u2019t quite her passion.",
      "There wasn\u2019t one \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, but she does remember seeing how passionate Woodley was about getting the role \u201cThe Descendants,\u201d which would prove to be her breakout.",
      "\u201cShe really wanted that role and she knew that it was her role and she was just like fighting for it and working so hard and was so passionate. I remember thinking that\u2019s so inspiring and so cool that she feels that way about this. And then I was like, \u2018(expletive), I don\u2019t feel that way about acting.\u2019\"",
      "Instead, Park found that spark in writing, and eventually directing, starting with shorts and music videos for the likes of Billie Eilish, Gucci Mane and even her husband, singer-songwriter Tyler Hilton, before setting off to do a feature.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know that writing and directing movies was a viable career. So I came about it a little bit backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so lucky that I had such an education of like 20 years on a film set before I was ever behind the camera, where I was really absorbing way more than I thought I was absorbing.\u201d",
      "As a filmmaker, Park said she has two aesthetic extremes inside of her. The first is \u201cheartfelt, evergreen, nostalgic movies.\u201d Think Chris Columbus, \u201cStepmom,\u201d \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d and \u201cMy Girl,\u201d she said. Her other passion is quiet, French, female-driven cinema. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cTomboy\u201d is the only movie she has downloaded on her computer. On set, she likes to keep things calm, reminding those around her that they\u2019re not \u201csaving lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI genuinely think that\u2019s an important mentality to have because people get so caught up in it. There\u2019s always going to be a fire, there\u2019s always going to be not enough time, but there\u2019s always going to be a fix to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to just be clear with what I need, but also really flexible. I think the best directors are people who consider their role as not as the end-all, be-all genius behind the magic because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re the curator of creating an environment for creativity to thrive.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s seen all the extremes as an actor: The energies that work, the ones that don\u2019t and how all actors need different things from the director. And her actors appreciate that about her.",
      "\u201cI want every single movie for the rest of my life to be directed by a woman,\u201d said Stella. \u201cIt was one of my favorite experiences. I was just constantly surrounded by female energy, which was very inspiring for me and very safe. It just felt very cozy and sweet and it was very easy to work in that environment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been almost a year now since \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d became one of the breakout films of the Sundance Film Festival, and almost three years since she started working on it, or, basically half of her nearly 5-year-old daughter\u2019s life (she calls it \u201cthe Maisie movie\u201d). With a new 4-month-old as well, she's just started work on another film. But she\u2019s still feeling the glow from \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d and the effect it\u2019s having on audiences.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really get your hopes that high that people are going to feel anything, let alone how deeply they seem to be feeling the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of surreal, honestly and really beautiful and hard to metabolize it all.\u201d"

      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

      "The group declined to release details about what, specifically, they will seek to undo. But abortion rights advocates are bracing for further abortion restrictions once Trump takes office. And some women are, too, with online abortion pill orders spiking in the days after Election Day.",
      "Trump has said abortion is an issue for the states, not the federal government. Yet, during the campaign, he pointedly noted that he appointed justices to the Supreme Court who were in the majority when striking down the national right to abortion. And there are things his administration can do, from picking judges to issuing regulations, to further an anti-abortion agenda.",
      "The Trump administration is expected to pull back Biden's controversial directive that requires emergency rooms to provide abortions when necessary to stabilize a woman's health or life. The Biden administration had argued that the decades-old federal law, which requires hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment for patients in exchange for Medicare funding, also applies in cases where an abortion might be needed.",
      "Reports of women being sent home or left untreated by hospitals in dangerous scenarios have proliferated across the United States since the Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion in 2022. In some cases, hospitals said state abortion bans had stopped them from terminating a pregnancy.",
      "\u201cWe're seeing the lives of pregnant people be put in jeopardy,\" Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said Wednesday. \"We're seeing women who have become infertile, who have been subject to sepsis and we're now hearing reports with death.\"",
      "Even if a Trump administration abandons the guidance of the law, Goss Graves said advocacy groups like hers will continue a legal fight for the Biden administration's interpretation of the law.",
      "Some doctors and hospitals also have said the federal guidance offered a protection for them to perform emergency abortions in states like Idaho and Texas, where threat of prosecution for performing an abortion hangs over their decision-making.",
      "Trump has said he supports exceptions for rape and incest cases, as well as when a woman's life is at risk. But he has not gone as far as saying he supports exemptions when a woman's health is on the line.",
      "Abortions might be necessary to prevent organ loss, significant hemorrhage or dangerous infections for pregnant women in rare but serious scenarios. In cases like ectopic pregnancy, premature rupture of membranes and placental abruptions, a fetus might still be alive but continuing the pregnancy can be detrimental. Doctors have argued that the legal gray area has put them in a bind.",
      "In Idaho, for example, one hospital resorted to airlifting women out of the state after a strict abortion ban, which only allowed for abortions to prevent a woman's death, was enacted.",
      "The Biden administration sued Idaho, arguing its state law conflicted with federal law requiring hospitals to provide stabilizing treatment, which might include abortions, for patients. The state amended its law to allow abortions for ectopic pregnancies, but other dangerous scenarios still remain unaccounted for. The Supreme Court declined to address the issue earlier this year, issuing a limited order that cleared the way for hospitals to provide emergency abortions while the case worked its way through lower courts.",
      "Enforcement of the federal law, however, is on hold in Texas, which challenged the Biden administration's guidance on emergency abortions.",
      "A patchwork of state laws governing abortion will remain in place under the Trump administration. Voters in Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota on Tuesday defeated constitutional amendments, leaving bans in place.",
      "In Missouri, however, voters approved a ballot measure on Tuesday to undo one of the nation's strictest bans. Abortion rights amendments also passed in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect.",
      "The ease with which women have been able to get abortion pills could also be up for reconsideration under Trump.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration made it easier to obtain abortion pills, including mifepristone, allowing women to access the medication over telehealth. The agency has approved the drug's safety through 10 weeks of pregnancy, saying that adverse effects happen for .32% of patients.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have challenged that, arguing the medications are not safe and at the very least not fit for eased access without in-person supervision by a doctor.",
      "Although the Supreme Court preserved access to the drug earlier this year, anti-abortion advocates and conservative states have renewed their challenge in lower courts.",
      "Some women are worried. Telehealth company Wisp saw an immediate spike in abortion pill orders between Election Day and the following day, with a 600% increase. In states like Florida and Texas, where the medication cannot be legally shipped, the company saw a nearly 1000% percent increase in orders of so-called \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, also known as emergency contraception.",
      "The company fills about tens of thousands of orders monthly for reproductive products including birth control pills and abortion pills, CEO Monica Cepak told the Associated Press.",
      "Right now women typically take a two-step regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol to complete a medication abortion. Cepak said the company will keep a \u201cclose eye\u201d on mifepristone under a Trump administration and is prepared to shift to a misoprostol-only regimen should restriction to mifepristone be implemented.",
      "But Trump could be a wild card on the issue, said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis who is an expert on reproductive health issues. In the final months of the campaign, he backed away from a more rigid stance on abortion \u2014 even saying he would not sign a national abortion ban if it came across his desk.",
      "Although he has enjoyed firm backing from anti-abortion groups, he is willing to break with allies when he wants.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we have a clear sense from him about what he would do,\u201d Ziegler said.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:58:50 -0500",

      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that",
      "The majority of strokes could be prevented, according to new guidelines aimed at helping people and their doctors do just that.",
      "Stroke was the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half a million Americans have a stroke every year. But up to 80% of strokes may be preventable with better nutrition, exercise and identification of risk factors.",
      "The first new guidelines on stroke prevention in 10 years from the American Stroke Association, a division of the American Heart Association, include recommendations for people and doctors that reflect a better understanding of who gets strokes and why, along with new drugs that can help reduce risk.",
      "The good news is that the best way to reduce your risk for stroke is also the best way to reduce your risk for a whole host of health problems \u2014 eat a healthy diet, move your body and don't smoke. The bad news is that it's not always so easy to sustain.",
      "Dr. Sean Duke, a stroke doctor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, blames the forces in society that keep people sedentary and eating poorly, like cell phones and cheap, unhealthy food. \u201cOur world is stacked against us,\u201d he said.",
      "Here's what to know about stroke and the new guidelines:",
      "A stroke happens when blood flow to part of the brain is blocked or if a blood vessel in the brain bursts. That deprives the brain of oxygen which can cause brain damage that can lead to difficulty thinking, talking and walking, or even death.",
      "Eating healthy can help control several factors that increase your risk for stroke, including high cholesterol, high blood sugar, and obesity, according to the heart association.",
      "The group recommends foods in the so-called Mediterranean diet such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and olive oil, which can help keep cholesterol levels down. It suggests limiting red meat and other sources of saturated fat. Instead, get your protein from beans, nuts, poultry, fish and seafood.",
      "Limit highly processed foods and foods and drinks with a lot of added sugar. This can also reduce your calorie intake, which helps keep weight in check.",
      "Getting up and walking around for at least 10 minutes a day can \u201cdrastically\u201d reduce your risk, said Dr. Cheryl Bushnell, a neurologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine who was part of the group that came up with the new guidelines. Among the many benefits: Regular exercise can help reduce blood pressure, a major risk factor for stroke.",
      "Of course, more is better: The heart association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic or 75 minutes of vigorous activity \u2014 or some combination \u2014 per week. How you do it doesn't matter so much, experts said: Go to the gym, take a walk or run in your neighborhood or use treadmills or stepper machines at home.",
      "Diet and exercise can help control weight, another important risk factor for strokes. But a new class of drugs that can drastically reduce weight have been approved by regulators, providing new tools to reduce stroke risk since guidelines were last updated.",
      "The guidelines now recommend that doctors consider prescribing these drugs, including those sold under the brand names Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound, to people with obesity or diabetes.",
      "But while those drugs can help, people still need to eat well and get exercise, cautions Dr. Fadi Nahab, a stroke expert at Emory University Hospital.",
      "The new guidelines for the first time recommend doctors screen patients for other factors that could increase stroke risk, including sex and gender and non-medical factors such as economic stability, access to health care, discrimination and racism. For example, the risk for having a first stroke is nearly twice as high for Black adults in the U.S. as it is for white adults, according to the CDC.",
      "\u201cIf somebody doesn\u2019t have insurance or they can\u2019t get to a doctor\u2019s office because of transportation issues or they can\u2019t get off work to get health care ... these are all things that can impact the ability to prevent stroke,\" Bushnell said.",
      "Doctors may be able to point to resources for low-cost health care or food, and can give ideas about how to be active without breaking the bank for a gym membership.",
      "The guidelines also now recommend doctors should screen for conditions that could increase a woman's risk for stroke, such as high blood pressure during pregnancy or early menopause.",
      "Three of the most common stroke symptoms include face weakness, arm weakness and difficulty speaking. And time is important, because brain damage can happen quickly and damage can be limited if a stroke is treated quickly. Stroke experts have coined an acronym to help you remember: FAST. F for face, A for arm, S for speech, and T for time. If you think you or a loved one could be having a stroke, call 911 right away.",

      "The new variant of mpox was first detected earlier this year in eastern Congo. Scientists believe it causes milder symptoms that are harder to notice, which makes it easier to spread because people may not know they are infected. Its spread in Congo and elsewhere in Africa prompted the World Health Organization to declare a global emergency in August.",
      "Britain recorded more than 3,000 cases of another type of mpox during a 2022 outbreak that hit more than 100 countries.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump is refusing to say how he voted on Florida's abortion measure \u2014 and getting testy about it.",
      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",
      "If it\u2019s rejected, the state\u2019s restrictive six-week abortion law would stand.",
      "The first time he was asked, Trump avoided answering. He said instead of the issue that he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d That was a reference to the former president having appointed three conservative justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped overturn the landmark Roe v.

      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",

      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",

      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Nebraska has a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot, including two competing ones pertaining to abortion abortion rights",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Nebraska will have a record number of petition-initiated measures on the ballot Tuesday, including two competing ones that address abortion rights. Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

    "story": [
      "Federal health officials are calling for more testing and treatment of workers on farms with bird flu",
      "Federal health officials on Thursday called for more testing of employees on farms with bird flu after a new study showed that some dairy workers had signs of infection, even when they didn't report feeling sick.",
      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",
      "\u201cIt shows yet again that we are not responding effectively to the H5N1 cattle outbreak in humans or animals and if we continue to let this virus spread and jump from species to species, our luck will eventually run out,\u201d Rasmussen said in an email.",
      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",
      "Researchers said that efforts to monitor dairy workers for illness have been hindered by several barriers including the reluctance of farm owners and farmworkers to allow testing.",
      "Rasmussen and others have criticized the federal response to the outbreak as too slow and \u201clackluster.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese studies should have been performed months ago and should have been prioritized,\u201d she said.",
      "The virus has been confirmed in at least 446 cattle herds in 15 states. Last week, the Agriculture Department said a pig at an Oregon farm was confirmed to have bird flu, the first time the virus was detected in U.S. swine.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff's 24-month sentence , calling his crime \u201ctruly despicable conduct.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have made it extremely difficult to understand what motivated you,\u201d Nachmanoff said. He said Russell made matters worse by lying to investigators and on the witness stand.",
      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",
      "Russell and his lawyer declined to comment after Thursday's hearing on whether they plan to appeal."

      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",

      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",

      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",

      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands.

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "Dr. Thomas Kwan disguised himself as a nurse making home virus booster visits to infect Patrick O\u2019Hara with a flesh-eating poison because he believed the older man stood in the way of him inheriting his mother's home some day.",
      "\u201cIt was an audacious plan to murder a man in plain sight and you very nearly succeeded,\u201d Justice Christina Lambert said. \u201cYou were certainly obsessed by money and more particularly, the money to which you considered yourself entitled.\"",

      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court.

      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",
      "The mostly Republican states of Montana and Missouri passed abortion rights protections and also elected GOP candidates for president, U.S. Senate and governor.",
      "In Montana, Republican Tim Sheehy defeated three-term incumbent Sen. Jon Tester, who attempted to pair his campaign with the abortion rights push.",
      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",
      "In Ohio, Republican Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown after Brown and his allies pounced on cellphone video that emerged late in the campaign showing Moreno criticizing suburban women who base their votes on abortion rights.",

    "summary": "An amendment to New York&rsquo;s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pregnancy outcomes.&rdquo;",

      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

The visit comes amid wider tensions gripping the Mideast over the Israel-Hamas war and uncertainty over how U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will approach Iran after his inauguration in January.",
      "Specifically, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mariano Grossi, will have high level meetings with the Iranian government and will hold technical discussions on all aspects related to the joint statement agreed with Iran in March 2023.",
      "It is intended as a path forward for cooperation between the IAEA and Iran on how to expand inspections of the Islamic Republic\u2019s rapidly advancing atomic program.",
      "The 2023 statement included a pledge by Iran to resolve issues around sites where inspectors have questions about possible undeclared nuclear activity, and to allow the IAEA to \u201cimplement further appropriate verification and monitoring activities.\u201d",

      "Iran\u2019s 2015 landmark nuclear deal with world powers had put limits on its nuclear program \u2014 which the West fears could be used for making nuclear weapons although Tehran insists is only for peaceful purposes \u2014 while lifting punitive economic sanctions imposed on Iran.",
      "But the deal collapsed after the Trump administration in 2018 pulled the United States out of the agreement, leading Iran to abandon all limits the deal had put on its program and enrich uranium to up to 60% purity.",

      "As Trump is to take office again in a few weeks, Iranians are divided on what his next presidency will bring. Some foresee an all-out war between Tehran and Washington, particularly as other conflicts rage in the region. Others hold out hope that America\u2019s 47th president might engage in unexpected diplomacy as he did with North Korea.",

      "After making landfall in Aurora on Monday morning with sustained winds of up to 130 kilometers (81 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 180 kph (112 mph), the typhoon was expected to barrel northwestward across Luzon, weaken as it crosses a mountain range and then blow into the South China Sea.",
      "Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla on Sunday ordered the forcible evacuation of people in 2,500 villages expected to be lashed by Toraji, locally named Nika, warning that the rain-soaked Luzon mountains, valleys and plains were more susceptible to flash floods and landslides.

      "Overwhelmed, the Philippines received help from Southeast Asian countries led by Singapore, along with longtime treaty ally the United States, to transport food, water and other aid to hard-hit northern provinces.",
      "The Philippine archipelago is often battered by typhoons and earthquakes and has more than a dozen active volcanoes, making it one of the most natural disaster-prone countries in the world.",
      "In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the strongest recorded tropical cyclones, left more than 7,300 people dead or missing, flattened entire villages and caused ships to run aground and smash into houses in the central Philippines."

      "The announcement, written by his two sons, who run the winemaking company, called him \u201clarger than life, visionary, charismatic, innovator, maverick.\u201d Maverick he undoubtedly was.",
      "Politicians across the spectrum paid tribute to Boutaris, emphasizing his passionate and non-conformist personality.",
      "Boutaris, a progressive man who eschewed party labels, was involved in local politics late in life, being elected municipal councilor at age 60. He first ran for mayor in 2006, coming third, before running a successful campaign in 2010. His supporters ranged from leftists to moderate conservatives, and he won by a whisker in a city where hardline conservatives had held the mayor\u2019s office for 24 years. In 2014, he won reelection with 58% of the vote.",
      "After a four-year hiatus, he was elected municipal councilor again in 2023, serving until his death.",
      "\u201cHe was the daring visionary who fought with all his might to bring the city back in touch with its rich multicultural, colorful and cosmopolitan past,\u201d said current Thessaloniki mayor Stelios Angeloudis.",
      "As mayor of a city close to other Balkan countries, Boutaris worked on good neighborly relations.",
      "He sought to attract Turkish tourists to the city where the Turkish Republic\u2019s founder, Kemal Ataturk, was born. He invited Zoran Zaev, the prime minister of what was then The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, to dinner on New Year\u2019s Day 2017, paving the way for an agreement between the countries that ended a decades-long dispute over the name Macedonia, and after which Greece\u2019s northern neighbor adopted the name North Macedonia. He also emphasized the city\u2019s strong Jewish heritage, playing an important role in building the Holocaust Museum.",
      "These moves were sometimes resented by the city\u2019s nationalist element, including the Orthodox Church. Boutaris did not shy from confrontation, leading the city\u2019s archbishop, Anthimos, to name-call him during a church service in October 2010, telling him that without the Church\u2019s support he could not hope to be elected mayor. Nineteen days later, he was.",
      "In May 2018, a gang of nationalists attacked Boutaris, slightly injuring him. Nine persons, including a police officer, were convicted for the attack five years later.",
      "\u201cMy views on gay pride and North Macedonia caused great enmity and personal hatred,\u201d he had said in an interview.",
      "Before he delved into politics, Boutaris had made his name in the winemaking business founded by his grandfather. Business differences with his brother led him to quit the family business in 1996 and start his own, Kir-Yianni (\u201cMr. Yiannis\u201d) winery.",
      "Boutaris was also an active environmentalist, founding an NGO, Arktouros, initially aiming to protect the country\u2019s brown bears, but whose sanctuary eventually took on many other species. He was also involved in his beloved Aris Thessaloniki sports club. The club\u2019s professional basketball team said he was a major provider of funds during the club\u2019s golden era in the 1980s and 1990s.",
      "In 2021, he published a well-received memoir, \u201c60 Years of Harvests,\u201d in which he was open about his struggles with alcoholism. He had stayed sober since 1991.",
      "Besides his two sons, his survivors include a daughter and six grandchildren.",
      "His family announced that he will be cremated Tuesday. No religious service will take place.",

      "A massive drone strike has rattled Moscow and its suburbs, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia\u2019s busiest airports",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A massive drone strike rattled Moscow and its suburbs overnight into Sunday, injuring several people and temporarily halting traffic at some of Russia's busiest airports, officials reported. Meanwhile, a huge nighttime wave of Russian drones targeted Ukraine.",
      "This came after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed into law a pact with North Korea Saturday night, obliging the two countries to provide immediate military aid using \u201call means\u201d if either is attacked. The agreement marks the strongest link between Moscow and Pyongyang since the end of the Cold War.",
      "Earlier this week, Ukraine reported that its troops engaged for the first time with North Korean units. U.S. officials earlier confirmed the deployment of at least 3,000 North Korean troops to Russia, while Kyiv has repeatedly said the number is far higher. This has fueled concerns of a marked escalation in Moscow's war on Ukraine, and tensions spilling over into the Asia-Pacific.",
      "Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following \u201chuman wave\u201d attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses.",
      "However, the chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told the BBC that Russian forces had suffered their worst month of casualties in October since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. He said Moscow\u2019s troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded per day, bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.",
      "According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying \u201can extraordinary price\u201d for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine\u2019s industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how U.K. officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,\u201d he said. But he added that they were \u201ctiny increments of land,\u201d and Moscow\u2019s mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.",
      "Radakin insisted that Ukraine\u2019s Western partners should stand by it for \u201cas long as it takes\u201d to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.",
      "On Sunday, the Kremlin\u2019s official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump\u2019s upcoming presidency, saying: \u201cAt least he talks about peace. \u2026 He does not talk about confrontation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,\u201d Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing.",
      "\u201cHe does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (U.S.) administration,\u201d Peskov said.",
      "But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday insisted that \u201cstrong decisions\u201d from Kyiv\u2019s Western partners are needed to stop the \u201cterror\u201d of Russian drone and missile strikes, and secure \u201creliable peace\u201d for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe killing of children, the loss of family members cannot simply be forgotten,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a post on the Telegram messaging app.",
      "\u201cWithout strong decisions, there is no security from terror, and this is equally clear in every country. There is no reliable peace without justice,\u201d he said.",
      "Fierce fighting has continued near the eastern Ukrainian cities of Toretsk and Kurakhove, Ukraine\u2019s General Staff reported Sunday. Between 700 and 1,000 residents remain in Kurakhove, a front-line city surrounded on three sides and battered into ruin. Most of them live underground with no running water, heating or electricity.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said a total of 84 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, following what it called a \u201cmass strike on civilian infrastructure.\" A man died under rubble after drones struck his apartment block in Russia\u2019s Belgorod region, just kilometers from the Ukrainian border, local Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported.",
      "Five other people were injured in the Moscow suburb of Ramenskoe and a nearby village, according to local officials. Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.",
      "Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo. At least 14 flights bound for Moscow were rerouted to Nizhnyi Novgorod, a city over 490 kilometers (300 miles) east, airport representatives there reported.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s General Staff claimed on Sunday that Ukrainian drones caused a fire at an arms depot in Russia\u2019s southern Bryansk region, near Ukraine and Belarus. The online update featured a photo showing thick plumes of reddish smoke rising into the night sky. The AP could not verify the circumstances in which it was taken, and there was no immediate comment from Russia.",
      "Separately, Russia\u2019s emergencies ministry on Sunday said that a major fire broke out at a warehouse outside of Moscow. There were no immediate reports of casualties, and it was not clear whether the blaze was linked to the Ukrainian drone strikes.",
      "Russia overnight launched a \u201crecord\u201d 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine\u2019s air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were \u201clost,\u201d the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.",
      "At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine\u2019s southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported. And at least five civilians, including a 17-year-old girl and 10-year-old boy, were injured by falling drone debris and shelling in Ukraine\u2019s northeastern Kharkiv region Sunday, its Gov. Oleh Syniehubov and local prosecutors said.",

      "The decree, set to be published on Monday, was provided to The Associated Press by a government source. It marks even more turmoil in an already rocky democratic transition process for Haiti, which hasn\u2019t held democratic elections in years in a large part due to the soaring levels of gang violence plaguing the Caribbean nation.",
      "Fils-Aim\u00e9 is the former president of Haiti\u2019s Chamber of Commerce and Industry and in 2015 ran an unsuccessful campaign for Senate. The businessman studied at Boston University and was previously considered for the position as a private sector candidate for the post before Conille took the seat.",
      "Conille, a longtime civil servant who has worked with the United Nations, served as prime minister for only six months.",
      "The AP on Sunday couldn\u2019t reach Conille or a spokesperson for him.",
      "The transitional presidential council was established in April, tasked with choosing Haiti\u2019s next prime minister and Cabinet with the hope that it would help quell turmoil Haiti. But the council has been plagued with politics and infighting, and has long been at odds with Conille. Organizations like the Organization of American States tried and failed last week to mediate disagreements in an attempt to save the fragile transition, according to The Miami Herald.",
      "The process suffered another blow in October when three members on the council faced corruption accusations, from anti-corruption investigators alleging that they demanded $750,000 in bribes from a government bank director to secure his job.",

      "Those same members accused of bribery, Smith Augustin, Emmanuel Vertilaire and Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, were among those to sign the decree. Only one member, Edgard Leblanc Fils, did not sign the order.",
      "The move by the transitional council came under fire by some in Haiti like former Justice Minister Bernard Gousse, who told local media that Conille's dismissal was \u201cillegal\u201d because the council was over-extending its powers and because of the corruption allegations levered against them.",

      "The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out on purchases during the shopping extravaganza.",

      "Rivals of former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina have thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in the capital",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Rivals of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday thwarted a plan by her Awami League party to hold a rally in Bangladesh\u2019s capital, seen as a potential first effort to make a comeback on the streets since she fled the country in August amid a mass uprising.",
      "The rally in Dhaka by Hasina\u2019s party was to commemorate the death of a party activist on Nov. 10, 1987, which had sparked a mass protest against former military dictator H.M. Ershad. He was eventually ousted from office, ending his nine-year rule in 1990.",
      "The day is commemorated as \u201cdemocracy day.\u201d In 1991, Bangladesh switched to a parliamentary democracy from a presidential form of government, and since then Hasina and her rival, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, became the most powerful political figures in the country.",
      "On Sunday, activists of the party headed by Zia, Hasina\u2019s main rival, and also members of the conservative Jamaat-e-Islami party took to the streets of Dhaka, filling up much of the area where the rally was scheduled to take place.",
      "Others, including hundreds of student protesters, also announced that they wouldn't allow Hasina\u2019s supporters to stand on the streets and hold the rally. The protesters said that they think Hasina\u2019s party was trying to make a comeback by holding a rally on the streets on Sunday. The protesters from the Anti-discrimination Student Movement, a group that led the mass uprising in July-August, aggressively hunted for supporters of Hasina.",
      "Groups of people surrounded the Awami League party\u2019s headquarters near the Noor Hossain Square in Dhaka where Hasina\u2019s supporters were supposed to gather to hold the rally.",
      "Security was tight in the area, but witnesses and local media said that the protesters attacked several supporters of Hasina when they attempted to reach there and chanted slogans in favor of the fallen leader.",
      "The Awami League party said that many of their activists were detained by police as they came under attacks.",
      "Tensions ran high throughout Sunday with the anti-Hasina protesters saying that they wouldn't allow the party to hold any public rally under any circumstances.",
      "The Awami League party posted a number of videos on Facebook on Sunday showing its supporters being manhandled. Its party headquarters had earlier been vandalized following Hasina\u2019s fall on Aug. 5, and on Sunday it was empty and there were signs of destruction. Outside, control was in the hands of Hasina\u2019s opponents.",
      "The political chaos in the South Asian nation went on as Zia\u2019s party was seeking quick reforms and a new election from an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus. The party believes it will be able to form the new government in the absence of Hasina\u2019s party, while its other allies are also struggling.",
      "The Yunus-led government said it would seek extradition of Hasina and her close associates as they face charges of crimes against humanity involving deaths of hundreds of protesters during the uprising.",
      "On Sunday, Bangladesh\u2019s Law Adviser Asif Nazrul said the interim government would ask Interpol to issue red notices seeking the arrest and repatriation of fugitives allegedly responsible for the deaths of people during the mass uprising.",
      "\u201cWe will \u2026 prioritize bringing them back from wherever they are hiding,\u201d he told reporters in Dhaka."

      "A special parliamentary session convenes later Monday to pick a new leader. A vote is mandatory within 30 days of a general election. In the past, these votes did not attract as much attention because an LDP leader was virtually assured to be prime minister. Though his re-election on Monday is considered likely, Ishiba will face a runoff with top opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda.",

He only wants to cooperate with Ishiba\u2019s party on policy \u2014 not as part of a coalition \u2014 since he wants to use his leverage to increase his party\u2019s standing ahead of the next election.",

      "Ishiba\u2019s government is preparing for his trip later this month to ASEAN and Group of 20 summits, as well as a possible meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on his way home.",

      "LONDON -- King Charles III led the nation Sunday in a two-minute silence in remembrance of fallen service personnel in central London as the Princess of Wales looked on, a further sign that the royal family is slowly returning to normal at the end of a year in which two of the most popular royals were sidelined by cancer.",
      "Remembrance Sunday is a totemic event in the U.K., with the monarch leading senior royals, political leaders, including Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his eight living predecessors, and envoys from the Commonwealth countries in laying wreaths at the Cenotaph, the Portland stone memorial that serves as the focal point for honoring the nation\u2019s war dead.",
      "The service is held on the second Sunday of November to mark the signing of the armistice to end World War I \u201con the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month\u201d in 1918. Across the U.K., services are conducted at the same time in memory of the dead.",

      "His eldest son and the heir to the throne, Prince William, left his own floral tribute \u2014 featuring the Prince of Wales\u2019 feathers and a new ribbon in Welsh red.",
      "Dressed in somber black, his wife, Kate, watched on from a balcony of the nearby Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office, as is tradition. Queen Camilla, who would normally be standing next to the princess, wasn't present as she recovered from a chest infection.",
      "It's the first time since the start of the year that Kate carried out two consecutive days of public official engagements. On Saturday, she attended the Royal British Legion Festival Of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "Following the wreath-laying, around 10,000 veterans, including those who have fought in wars this century, notably in Afghanistan and Iraq, marched past the Cenotaph. With the passage of time, there were only a handful of World War II veterans present.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always a great honor to be back on occasions like this, but I remember the guys that never came home on my ship when it was torpedoed,\" said 99-year-old Stan Ford, who has had to walk with leg calipers ever since the ship that he was serving on \u2014 HMS Fratton \u2014 was sunk off France's Normandy coast in August 1944 at the cost of 31 lives.",
      "\u201cThey never came home, and I always feel it\u2019s my duty to put in an appearance and thank God for those that did survive, and to pray for the ones who didn\u2019t,\" said Ford, who was one of 38 survivors.",
      "Charles\u2019 ceremonial role as commander in chief of the armed forces is a holdover from the days when the monarch led his troops into battle. But the link between the monarchy and the military is still very strong, with service members taking an oath of allegiance to the king and members of the royal family supporting service personnel through a variety of charities. Charles and William served on active duty in the military before taking up full-time royal duties.",
      "Charles was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February, forcing him to step away from public appearances for two months as he focused on his treatment and recovery. Just a few weeks later, Kate announced her own cancer diagnosis, which sidelined her for much of the year as she underwent chemotherapy.",
      "The king has been in good form in recent months and recently completed a taxing trip to Australia and Samoa. Kate, who made her first post-diagnosis public appearance during the monarch's birthday parade in June, is slowly returning to public duties.",
      "Prince William reflected this week on the strain that the cancer scare has placed on the royal family.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m so proud of my wife, I\u2019m proud of my father, for handling the things that they have done,\u201d William told reporters on Thursday as he wrapped up a four-day trip to South Africa. \u201cBut from a personal family point of view, it\u2019s been, yeah, it\u2019s been brutal.\u201d",
      "While the Cenotaph was the focus of the national remembrance service, communities throughout the U.K. held their own ceremonies on Sunday.",
      "Needham-Crofton, who served with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers before a truck accident ended his military career, planned to attend a local service in Eastbourne on the south coast of England.",
      "He has spent much of his time honoring veterans and trying to help them, including 20 years as a volunteer for the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans. Like some of his army tasks, raising cash was rather grueling as it involved standing in front of London subway stations collecting coins to help fund the group\u2019s efforts.",
      "\u201cI like to respect all the veterans and do what I can for them,\" he told The Associated Press. \u201cIt\u2019s a brotherhood really. Even if you don\u2019t know a veteran that you meet, you feel a kinship toward them. That is very important to me. I shall be like that for the rest of my life.\""

      "China has published baselines for a contested shoal in the South China Sea it had seized from the Philippines, a move that\u2019s likely to increase tensions over overlapping territorial claims",
      "BEIJING -- China has published baselines for a contested shoal in the South China Sea it had seized from the Philippines, a move that's likely to increase tensions over overlapping territorial claims.",
      "The Foreign Ministry on Sunday posted online geographic coordinates for the baselines around Scarborough Shoal. A nation\u2019s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone are typically defined as the distance from the baselines.",
      "Both China and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal and other outcroppings in the South China Sea. China seized the shoal, which lies west of the main Philippine island of Luzon, in 2012 and has since restricted access to Filipino fishermen there. A 2016 ruling by an international arbitration court found that most Chinese claims in the South China Sea were invalid but Beijing refuses to abide by it.",
      "Ships from China and the Philippines have collided several times as part of increased confrontations, and the Chinese coast guard has blasted Philippine vessels with water cannons.",
      "China\u2019s move came two days after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed two laws demarcating the government's claims in the disputed waters.",
      "A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said that the delimiting of the baselines was in accordance with a U.N. agreement and Chinese law.",
      "\u201cThis is a natural step by the Chinese government to lawfully strengthen marine management and is consistent with international law and common practices,\u201d it said.",
      "The statement added that one of the laws signed by Marcos, the Philippine Maritime Zones Act, violates China\u2019s sovereignty in the South China Sea.",
      "\u201cChina firmly opposes it and will continue to do everything necessary in accordance with law to firmly defend its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "China stakes claim to almost the entirety of the South China Sea. It has a series of disputes with several Southeast Asian nations including the Philippines and Vietnam over territory in the waters, which are part of a key shipping route in Asia.",

      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world",
      "As climate change leads to a seemingly endless stream of weather disasters around the world, countries are struggling to adapt to the new reality. Preparing to better withstand hurricanes, floods, heat waves, droughts and wildfires will take hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "And then there is confronting the root cause of climate change \u2014 the burning of fossil fuels like coal, gas and oil \u2014 by transitioning to clean energies like wind and solar.",
      "That will take trillions of dollars.",
      "Enter climate finance, a term for how to pay for projects to adapt to and combat the cause of climate change. It's especially important for developing countries, which don't have the same resources or access to credit that rich countries do.",
      "International mega banks, funded by taxpayer dollars, are the biggest, fastest-growing source of climate finance for the developing world. Called multilateral development banks because they get contributions from various countries, there are only a handful of these banks in the world, the World Bank the largest among them.",
      "The banks were a key reason why, in 2022, the world met a goal countries had set in 2009 to supply developing nations with $100 billion annually to address climate change.",
      "At the annual U.N. climate conference that opens Monday in Azerbaijan, global leaders are expected to discuss how to generate trillions of dollars for climate finance. The nonprofit research group Climate Policy Initiative estimates the world needs about five times the current annual amount of climate financing to limit warming to 1.5 C (2.7 degrees F) since the late 1800s. Currently, global average temperatures are about 1.3 C (2.3 degrees F) higher.",
      "A new goal needs to reach higher and hold institutions and governments accountable to their promises, said Tim Hirschel-Burns, an expert at Boston University's Global Development Policy Center.",
      "\"The core of it is getting a goal that is going to catalyze the actions that fills the really significant climate finance gap,\u201d he said.",
      "The debate has also shifted to the question of where the money will come from, said Dharshan Wignarajah, director of Climate Policy Initiative\u2019s London-based office.",
      "\u201cUltimately it comes down to who pays,\u201d said Wignarajah, who helped lead the climate talks, called the Conference of Parties, when the United Kingdom was host in 2021. \u201cThat has forced finance to be ever-more prominent at the COP discussions.\u201d",
      "Developing nations are much more reliant on these banks for financing climate projects than industrialized countries.",
      "In the U.S. and Canada, commercial banks and corporations provided funding for more than half of climate-friendly projects in 2022, according to Climate Policy Initiative. In sub-Saharan Africa, those private lenders only accounted for 7%.",
      "This is because it is harder for developing countries to get low interest rates.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Kenya, and you want to borrow from private lenders, they might charge you 10% interest rates because your credit rating isn\u2019t very good,\u201d Hirschel-Burns said.",
      "But the multilateral banks have better credit ratings than many countries do. For example, the International Development Association \u2014 an arm of the World Bank and the top international aid provider to Kenya \u2014 has the highest possible rating from Moody\u2019s Investor Service, while Kenya itself has a junk rating.",
      "The banks borrow money with that better rating, then lend to developing countries in turn, offering a more reasonable rate than governments could get if they borrowed directly from private lenders.",
      "The multilateral banks\u2019 development seek to improve people's health and the environment, expand energy access and end poverty. It means the banks have also provided billions of dollars for fossil fuel power plants, according to an AP analysis, though their policies have improved and fewer such projects have been funded in recent years.",
      "Investment in fossil fuels continues to rise worldwide, reaching $1.1 trillion in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency. And multilateral banks continue to rank among the biggest funders of fossil fuel-prolonging projects, helping to \u201clock in a high-carbon pathway\u201d for countries, according to a report by the Clean Air Fund, which lobbies for the funding of projects to improve air quality.",
      "\u201cIt should be assisting countries to leapfrog,\u201d said Jane Burston, CEO of the Clean Air Fund, referring to the idea that developing countries could industrialize with renewable energy and skip over development that rich nations historically made with fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt's baffling why development assistance is being given to something that continues to make people unhealthy as well as harms the planet,\u201d she added.",
      "For example, an arm of the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development loaned $105 million toward rehabilitating coal plants in India, with their last loans toward the project going out in 2018, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "However, the improvements made coal plants more efficient and reduced their greenhouse gas emissions, according to project documents.",
      "The Clean Air Fund's report estimated the World Bank provided $2.7 billion in \u201cfossil fuel prolonging finance\u201d between 2018 and 2022. During that time, the bank also loaned about 32 times the amount for renewables.",
      "\"Renewable energy support is always our first choice as we work to provide access to electricity,\" a World Bank spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The bank's policies still \u201cselectively support natural gas as a transition fuel\u201d if its research shows the project is low risk to the climate, the spokesperson said. The bank's recent policies require vetting for every project to make sure its investments reduce climate impacts.",
      "The World Bank delivered $42.6 billion in climate finance in its most recent fiscal year, a 10% increase from the year before. And at the most recent COP, the bank promised nearly half of its lending will soon go toward climate finance.",
      "In Vietnam, about half of power generation comes from fossil fuels, primarily coal power. The Asian Development Bank loaned about $900 million on coal in Vietnam, with their spending on the fossil fuel in the country ending in 2017. The bank's updated climate policies \u201cwill not support coal mining, processing, storage, and transportation, nor any new coal-fired power generation,\u201d it said in a statement. The bank put $9.8 billion toward climate finance in 2023, and aims to finance $100 billion in climate-friendly projects between 2019 and 2030.",
      "The country\u2019s biggest growth area for energy is in wind. The Global Energy Monitor ranks Vietnam seventh in the world in planned wind power. And the Asian Development Bank committed about $60 million in loans toward wind energy in Vietnam between 2021 and 2022.",
      "The banks have made broad commitments in recent years to align with the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. But those promises leave pathways open to continue funding fossil fuels, said Bronwen Tucker, global public finance co-manager at Oil Change International.",
      "According to the group's monitoring of the banks' commitments, all nine of the major banks tracked can fund gas projects in at least some cases.",
      "\u201cThe MDBs can't be climate bankers if they are still fossil bankers,\" she said. \u201cRelying on banks that are locking in fossil fuels and the worst-ever debt crisis is not working.\u201d",

      "The Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival is looking less shiny this year as e-commerce firms look abroad for growth",
      "HONG KONG -- Merchants and consumers alike found the Singles' Day shopping festival Monday less shiny than in years past as e-commerce firms look abroad for growth.",
      "The annual event named by the numeric form of its Nov. 11 date was started by e-commerce platform Alibaba, which offered attractive discounts to entice shoppers to spend big. The extravaganza has since expanded to other platforms like JD.com and Pinduoduo in China as well as abroad.",
      "While Singles\u2019 Day was previously a one-day event, shopping platforms in China now kickstart the festival weeks ahead to drum up sales volume. The festival has also traditionally been regarded as a barometer of consumer sentiment.",
      "But amid China\u2019s lagging domestic economy, dragged down by a real estate crisis and deflationary pressures, consumers no longer go all out on purchases during the shopping extravaganza.",
      "\u201cI only spent a few hundred yuan on daily necessities,\u201d said Wang Haihua, who owns a fitness center in Beijing.",
      "Wang said that the prices offered on e-commerce platforms during Singles\u2019 Day are not necessarily cheaper than usual.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all tricks and we\u2019ve seen through it over the years,\u201d she said.",
      "Zhang Jiewei, a 34-year-old who runs a barber shop in Xi\u2019an city, echoed Wang\u2019s sentiments, saying that he no longer trust Singles\u2019 Day promotions as some merchant tend to raise the usual price of a product before offering a discount, giving consumers the illusion they are getting a deal.",
      "\u201cI used to buy a lot two or three years ago and I even purchased a mobile phone (during Singles\u2019 Day),\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI stopped doing that following the pandemic because of less income. I am not going to buy anything this year,\u201d Zhang added.",
      "Some experts say that Beijing\u2019s recent stimulus measures have had little impact to boost consumer confidence.",
      "\u201cPeople are not interested in spending and are cutting back on big-ticket items,\u201d said Shaun Rein, founder and managing director of China Market Research Group in Shanghai. \u201cSince October 2022, the weak economy means that everything has been on discount year-round, 11.11 is not going to bring in more discounts that the month before.\u201d",
      "Rein said he expects low growth for the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festival as consumers tighten their spending in anticipation of difficult economic times ahead.",
      "Categories such as sportswear and fitness, however, have been doing well as customers \u201ctrade down a Gucci bag for Lululemon sportswear,\u201d he said.",
      "Platforms like JD.com and Alibaba, which operates e-commerce platforms Taobao and Tmall, previously used to publish the value of transactions made during the festival, but have since stopped revealing the total figure. While yearly growth used to be in the double digits, estimates of recent figures have dwindled to low single-digit growth.",
      "Syntun, a data provider, estimated that last year\u2019s gross merchandising volume sales across major e-commerce platforms grew just 2% to 1.14 trillion yuan ($156.40 billion), a far cry from double-digit growth before COVID-19.",
      "Merchants who typically take part in the Singles\u2019 Day shopping festivals say the costs of participation no longer pay off, amid high advertising fees and unsatisfactory sales.",
      "Zhao Gao, who owns a garment factory in eastern Zhejiang province, said that after paying advertising costs to e-commerce platforms he would only break even after sales.",
      "\u201cThe platforms have so many rules for promotions and customers have become more skeptical,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a merchant, I no longer participate in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions.\u201d",
      "Another merchant, Du Baonian who runs a food company processing mutton in Inner Mongolia, said that overall sales in the past year have fallen 15% as consumers downgraded and reduced consumption.",
      "Du said that while he still takes part in the Singles\u2019 Day promotions, the higher expenses do not typically generate returns because of sluggish sales.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing shrinking revenue, but advertisement on the platform can help us to maintain our leading sales position,\u201d he said, adding that he was considering advertising on more e-commerce platforms to target more consumers.",
      "Meanwhile, e-commerce platforms grappling with a slowing domestic market have also turned to overseas markets to seek new growth, offering promotions like global free shipping and allowing merchants to sell globally with ease.",
      "Alibaba, for example, said in a blog post on its Alizila site that some 70,000 merchants saw sales double with global free shipping. In markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, new customers also doubled, Alibaba said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Many veterans who\u2019ve started small businesses tell a similar story: Their military service prepared them mentally for the task, but they were at a disadvantage when it came to the financial part.",
      "\u201cVetrepreneurs\u201d \u2013 veterans that start small businesses or startups -- own nearly 2 million small businesses that employ 5.5 million people in the U.S., according to the Small Business Administration. They take in about $1.3 trillion in revenue annually. Their numbers have shrunk, however, as the veteran population has aged. In a 2023 report, the SBA found veteran ownership declined from 11% of businesses in 2014 to 8.1% in 2020.",
      "Veterans enter the business world prepared with skills they gain in the field like leadership and problem-solving. But they haven\u2019t had a chance to build up credit or savings that civilians have had more time to do. That can cause problems because banks use that information to approve loans. Not to mention the mental toll it takes to transition from the military life to civilian life.",
      "According to data from business coaching nonprofit SCORE, about a third of veteran businesses have limited access to capital or lack of financing. That compares to a quarter of non-veteran-owned firms.",
      "SCORE CEO Bridget Weston says the good news is that veterans have plenty of places to turn to for help. Those include nonprofit organizations aimed at getting them on their feet and building up financial literacy, veteran-only loans and grants, and contracts earmarked for veteran owned and disabled veteran owned small businesses.",
      "The place that many start is the Small Business Administration, which offers a program to get certified as a veteran-owned or disabled veteran-owned small business, which can make it easier to get certain loans and federal contracts.",
      "That\u2019s the route Jackson Dalton decided to take when he started Black Box Safety, a maker of personal protective equipment, in 2017. Dalton enlisted in the U.S. Marines in 2000 and was selected for the prestigious Marine Corps Special Operations. But a badly broken leg, suffered during training, eventually forced him medically retire after two years of active duty.",
      "Although the transition back to civilian life was difficult, Dalton went on to get a master\u2019s degree in public health, and spent 10 years working in the health and safety industry. When he ventured out on his own, he decided to focus on federal contracts and got certified by the SBA. He thought prisons would be a good place to start since 3% of their contracts go to disabled veteran businesses. His first contract was selling gloves to a prison in Minnesota. Today, he serves major clients like the Department of Veterans Affairs and the State of California.",
      "Dalton credits his military training with his success.",
      "\u201cThe skills and attributes that I picked up in the military were resilience and grit and the ability to adapt, improvise, overcome when you know, when encountering resistance or obstacles and barriers,\u201d he said.",
      "Veteran focused nonprofits can be another key place to look for help.",
      "Adam Isch, a Marine Corp. veteran who served two tours in Iraq, worked with nonprofit Warrior Rising in Salt Lake City, to find a mentor to help him start his business, Isch Body Works in Fort Worth, Texas, which sells men\u2019s hygiene products. The business donates part of its revenue to charities supporting Texas children in foster care and awaiting adoption. Similar nonprofits include Bunker Labs, Tactical Launch, and others around the country.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to start a business, especially a veteran, go find a group like a Warrior Rising, there are all kinds of different groups like that getting mentorship,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are people who are doing what you do. They\u2019re doing what I do, and they love it and they want to talk about it.\"",
      "For some, a veteran-earmarked loan can be what makes or breaks a business. Elizabeth Gore, the co-founder and President of Hello Alice, a financial technology firm that works with small businesses on getting funding, including 117,000 military small business owners. \u201cThey have to really struggle more than other groups and demographics on access to capital,\u201d she said.",
      "John Griveas in Buffalo, N.Y. spent two years as a Navy Seal in the mid-1990s and his remaining four years in New York in the active reserves, ending his tenure in 2002. After that he \u201cbounced around\u201d different jobs and spent 10 years in the local collections industry.",

Dog Treats as an LLC in 2015 and today they sell their treats at about 300 independently owned mom and pop brick and mortar stores, news shops, banks and even the Venetian Hotel on the Las Vegas strip.",
      "For himself and other veterans he\u2019s talked to, one of the biggest challenges they face is getting funds. He found a $10,000 grant via the FedEx Entrepreneur Fund, which partners with Hello Alice to give grants to small businesses owned by military veterans.

    "story": [
      "California farmers have been devoting more land to pistachios, which are seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation",
      "LOST HILLS, Calif. -- In a sprawling plant in the heart of California's farmland, millions of shells rush down a metallic chute and onto a conveyor belt where they are inspected, roasted, packaged and shipped off to groceries around the world.",
      "Pistachios are growing fast in California, where farmers have been devoting more land to a crop seen as hardier and more drought-tolerant in a state prone to dramatic swings in precipitation. The crop generated nearly $3 billion last year in California and in the past decade the United States has surpassed Iran to become the world\u2019s top exporter of the nut.",
      "\u201cThere has been an explosion over the last 10 or 15 years of plantings, and those trees are coming online,\u201d said Zachary Fraser, president and chief executive of American Pistachio Growers, which represents more than 800 farmers in the southwestern U.S. \u201cYou are starting to see the fruit of people\u2019s vision from 40 years ago.\u201d",
      "California grows more than a third of the country's vegetables and three quarters of its fruit and nuts, according to state agricultural statistics. Pistachios have surged over the past decade to become the state's sixth-biggest agricultural commodity in value ahead of longtime crops such as strawberries and tomatoes, the data shows.",
      "Much of the crop is headed to China, where it is a popular treat during Lunar New Year. But industry experts said Americans also are eating more pistachios, which were rarely in grocery stores a generation ago and today are a snack food found almost everywhere. They are sold with shells or without and flavors range from salt and pepper to honey roasted.",
      "The Wonderful Co., a $6 billion agricultural company known for brands such as Halo mandarins and FIJI Water, is the biggest name in pistachios. The company has grown pistachios since the 1980s, but it ramped up in 2015 after developing a rootstock that yields as much as 40% more nuts with the same soil and water, said Rob Yraceburu, president of Wonderful Orchards.",
      "Now, Wonderful grows between 15% and 20% of the U.S. pistachio crop, he said. Its pistachio orchards stretch across vast tracts of dust-filled farmland northwest of Los Angeles also lined with pomegranates and dairies. The trees are shaken each fall and the nuts hauled to a massive processing facility to be be prepped for sale.",
      "\"There is an increasingly growing demand in pistachios,\" Yraceburu said. \u201cThe world wants more.\u201d",
      "Pistachios are poised to weather California's dry spells better than its even bigger nut crop, almonds, which generated nearly $4 billion in the state last year, industry experts said.",
      "Pistachio orchards can be sustained with minimal water during drought, unlike almonds and other more sensitive crops. The trees also rely on wind instead of bees for pollination and can produce nuts for decades longer, Yraceburu said.",
      "Many California farmers who grow both nuts are applying lessons learned from almonds to the pistachio boom. Almond production, which is much bigger than pistachio, also soared in California, but prices fell amid a glut of post-pandemic supply while farmers grappled with drought and rising input costs, leading some to not replant aging orchards when it came time to take them out.",
      "Pistachio growers say they hope to avoid a similar fate and are striving to keep demand for the nut ahead of supply. For example, American Pistachio Growers recently inked an endorsement deal with a top cricket player in India hoping to help promote pistachios there, Fraser said.",
      "The rise of pistachios is part of California farmers' shift into perennial crops commanding higher returns than products such as cotton, according to a 2023 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.",
      "Perennial crops, which are not replanted annually, can't just be swapped out during dry years, which can be challenging during extensive drought, said Brad Franklin, a research fellow at the institute's Water Policy Center.",
      "But pistachios have benefits other perennial crops don't. They can go longer without water and grow in saline soils. That may make them appealing to California farmers who are facing limits on how much groundwater they can pump under a state law aimed at conserving the critical resource, he said.",
      "When farmers decide what to plant, \u201cI think the biggest thing is the market and where is the market,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cAnd water is right below that.\u201d",
      "Farmers across California are bracing for the impact of the 2014 state law aimed at ensuring a more sustainable use of groundwater after years of over pumping depleted basins and eroded water quality in some rural areas. About a fifth of California's pistachio crop is grown in areas that rely exclusively on groundwater for irrigation, Yraceburu said, adding he expects some of these orchards will eventually come out of production.",
      "But over the next few years, pistachio acreage is expected to continue to grow in the state as trees planted in recent years come into production. That is in contrast to almond and walnut acreage, which are stabilizing or declining as orchards are being pulled out, said David Maga\u00f1a, a senior analyst at Rabobank in Fresno, California.",
      "Pistachios require about 3 acre-feet (3,700 cubic meters) of water per acre (0.4 hectares) compared with nearly 4 acre-feet (4,934 cubic meters) for almonds and produce more per acre than almonds while fetching a higher price, he said.",
      "\u201cYou see all the value the pistachio industry is providing to California agriculture is approaching that of almonds with a lot less acreage,\u201d Maga\u00f1a said. \u201cI haven't seen pistachio orchards being pulled out.\u201d"

      "For the third weekend in a row, \u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d was the No. 1 movie at the box office, collecting $16.2 million in ticket sales in U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday. It fended off a pair of new challengers in the Hugh Grant horror thriller \u201cHeretic\u201d and the feel-good holiday movie \u201cThe Best Christmas Pageant Ever.\u201d",
      "With the election on Tuesday, the major studios opted not to put any new releases into theaters. That allowed Sony Pictures\u2019 \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d the third entry in the Tom Hardy-led franchise, to hold its position.",

Though \u201cHeretic\u201d has been critically acclaimed for the darkest turn yet by Grant, audiences were less impressed, giving it a \u201cC+\u201d CinemaScore.

      "Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House.",
      "But it might not be that easy.",
      "Many of the largest offshore wind companies put a brave face on the election results, pledging to work with Trump and Congress to build power projects and ignoring the incoming president's oft-stated hostility to them.",
      "In campaign appearances, Trump railed against offshore wind and promised to sign an executive order to block such projects.",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure that that ends on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in a May speech. \u201cI\u2019m going to write it out in an executive order. It\u2019s going to end on Day 1.\"",
      "\u201cThey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.\u201d",
      "Numerous federal and state scientific agencies say there is no evidence linking offshore wind preparation to a spate of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast in recent years. Turbines have been known to kill shorebirds, but the industry and regulators say there are policies to mitigate harm to the environment.",
      "Trump has railed against offshore wind turbines spoiling the view from a golf course he owns in Scotland. But numerous environmental groups say the real reason he opposes offshore wind is his support for the fossil fuel industry.",
      "There is almost 65 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity under development in the U.S., enough to power more than 26 million homes, and some turbines are already spinning in several states, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Currently operating projects include the Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project and the South Fork Wind Farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point on New York\u2019s Long Island.",
      "Trump is unlikely to end those projects but might have more leverage over ones still in the planning stage, those in the debate say.",
      "Bob Stern, who headed an office in the U.S. Energy Department responsible for environmental protection during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, said Trump can get Congress to reduce or eliminate tax credits for offshore wind that were granted in the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits are an integral part of the finances of many offshore wind projects.",
      "Stern, who leads the New Jersey anti-offshore wind group Save LBI, said Trump also could issue executive orders prohibiting further offshore leases and rescinding approval for ones already approved while pushing Congress to amend federal laws granting more protection for marine mammals.",
      "The president-elect also can appoint leaders of agencies involved in offshore wind regulation who would be hostile to it or less supportive.",
      "Opponents of offshore wind, many of them Republicans, were giddy following the election, saying they fully expect Trump to put an end to the industry.",
      "\u201cI believe this is a tipping point for the offshore wind industry in America,\u201d said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal groups opposing offshore wind on the East Coast. \"They have been given a glidepath by Democrat-run administrations at the federal and state level for many years. For this industry, (Tuesday's) results will bring headwinds far greater than they have faced previously.\"",
      "But Tina Zappile, director of the Hughes Center for Public Policy at New Jersey's Stockton University, noted that in 2018, Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke voiced strong support for offshore wind. And even though the president-elect has bashed the technology, she predicted he won't just make it go away.",
      "\u201cOffshore wind might appear to be on the chopping block \u2014 Trump\u2019s explicitly said this was something he\u2019d fix on the first day \u2014 but when the economics of offshore wind are in alignment with his overall strategies of returning manufacturing to America and becoming energy-independent, his administration is likely to back away slowly from this claim,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cOffshore wind may be temporarily hampered, but its long-term prospects in the U.S. are unlikely to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Commercial fishermen in Maine said they hope the Trump administration will undo policies designed to help build and approve offshore wind projects, saying regulators attempted to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the industry against political change. Jerry Leeman, CEO of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association, called on Trump to reverse a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.",
      "The offshore wind industry is taking an optimistic stance, pledging to work with Trump his political allies. National and New Jersey wind industry groups, and several offshore wind developers including Atlantic Shores and Denmark-based Orsted, issued similarly worded statements highlighting terms likely to appeal to Republicans including job creation, economic development and national security.",
      "\u201cBy combining the strengths of all domestic energy resources, the Trump administration can advance an economy that is dynamic, secure, and clean,\u201d Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. \"We are committed to working with the Trump-Vance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story.\u201d",
      "But few Republicans were in a welcoming mood following the election. New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra listed the major offshore wind companies in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to pack your bags and get the hell away from the Jersey Shore, our marine life, fishing industry and beautiful beaches.\u201d",
      "Kanitra said he was looking forward \u201cto your stock prices tanking.\u201d And that was starting to happen.",
      "The stock prices of European offshore wind companies, many of which are planning or building projects on the U.S. East Coast, plunged amid fears the new administration would seek to slow or end such projects. Orsted closed down nearly 14% on Wednesday and was down 11% over the past five days. Turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems was down nearly 24% over that same period.",
      "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, hosted Trump at a rally earlier this year at which Trump again vowed to kill offshore wind.",
      "\u201cWe are currently working out the specifics of what that will look like once he takes office again this January,\" VanDrew said. \u201cPresident Trump is a good friend of New Jersey, and he understands the devastating impact these projects will have on our communities.\u201d",

      "PHOENIX -- A natural gas utility with more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona over concerns about piping that is known to degrade in the heat.",
      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",
      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "German Eonomy Minister Robert Habeck says he hopes to become his Green Party\u2019s candidate for chancellor in the coming election",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's economy minister said Friday that he hopes to become his Green Party's candidate for chancellor in the upcoming election.",
      "The announcement by Robert Habeck, who is also vice chancellor, follows the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition on Wednesday.",
      "The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%. Germany\u2019s opposition center-right is leading in the polls.",
      "It is therefore unlikely that Habeck could end up as the country's leader. His move, however, indicates how German politicians are gearing up for an early election after the collapse of the coalition.",
      "\u201cI am applying as a candidate for the Greens, for the people of Germany,\u201d Habeck said in a video posted on X. \u201cIf you want, also as chancellor. But that is not my decision, that is your decision. Only you can decide that.\u201d",
      "Scholz indicated plans for a timeline that could bring an early election by late March \u2014 before the vote that is regularly scheduled for September 2025.",
      "However, the opposition is calling for an immediate confidence vote in the parliament to speed that up. Industry leaders are also among those saying that Germany needs a stable government in place soon, as the economy struggles and as Europe prepares for a change of leadership in the United States.",
      "Scholz on Friday said that he's willing to talk about the timing of a vote of confidence and the subsequent new election. He said consultations were taking place with stakeholders, including groups in the German Bundestag and constitutional bodies, in order \u201cto take into account what the others think and mean.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe that we will soon achieve good results, at least that would be my hope,\" he said on the sidelines of a meeting in Budapest.",
      "Habeck hopes to be nominated at a party conference in Wiesbaden next week. He doesn't appear to have serious contenders after Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced this summer that she didn't want to pursue a candidacy for chancellor.",
      "Germany has been governed since 2021 by a coalition led by Scholz's Social Democrats and which included the smaller pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.",
      "It has been an uneasy and fractious alliance, and it collapsed Wednesday when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a late-night move following disagreements over how to revive the shrinking economy.",
      "Scholz said that he hoped to lead the country with a minority government and call for an confidence vote in parliament in mid-January."

The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 08:10:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has filed a lawsuit challenging a measure Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Cherokee Nation Entertainment on Friday filed a lawsuit challenging a constitutional amendment Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court claims the measure approved by voters on Tuesday violates its constitutional rights, and seeks to block its enforcement before it takes effect Nov. 13. The constitutional amendment blocks a casino that was planned in Pope County.",
      "Pope County was one of four sites where casinos were allowed to be built under a constitutional amendment that voters approved in 2018. Casinos have already been set up in the other three locations.",
      "\u201cCherokee Nation Entertainment is firmly committed to protecting its constitutional rights, defending its lawfully issued casino license, and safeguarding the substantial investments it made in good faith based on the establishment of the Pope County casino license under Amendment 100 in 2018,\" Bart Calhoun, an attorney for Cherokee Nation Entertainment, said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest in a costly fight between the Cherokee Nation and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which had spent at least $30 million combined on the campaign over the ballot measure. The state Supreme Court last month rejected a lawsuit by the Cherokee Nation that sought to disqualify the measure from the ballot. The Choctaw Nation operates a casino near the Arkansas border.",
      "\u201cThis legal action to attempt to bypass the voice of Arkansas voters is not unexpected,\u201d said Hans Stiritz, spokesman for Local Voters in Charge, the campaign backed by the Choctaw Nation in favor of the measure. \u201cBut we are fully confident in the process that brought Issue 2 to the ballot. Arkansas voters have spoken clearly on Issue 2 and we expect it to stand.\u201d",
      "Attorney General Tim Griffin called the lawsuit \u201cbaseless\u201d and said he was prepared to vigorously defend the state.",
      "The proposed amendment removes the Pope County casino\u2019s authorization from the state constitution. It also requires future casino licenses to be approved by voters in the county where it would be located. The constitution currently requires casino license applicants to submit letters of support from local officials.",
      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has said it plans to build a 50,000-square-foot (4,600-square-meter) casino northeast of Russellville, 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. Plans also call for a 200-room hotel, a conference center and an outdoor music venue."

      "Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack.",
      "But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries \u2014 especially top polluting nation China \u2014 could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.",
      "\u201cThere's no hope of reaching a safe climate without substantive action from the United States, from China, from Europe,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions, which have been rising globally. He said he's certain the world is shooting past the internationally accepted threshold of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That's just a couple tenths of a degree away. Others believe the goal is alive.",
      "Trump's reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.",
      "\u201cAn emboldened Trump would be terrible,\u201d European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana said in August.",
      "On Wednesday, Tubiana, the former French official who helped forge the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that Trump pulled out of, called the election result a setback for global climate action. But she added: \"The Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country\u2019s policy.\u201d",
      "The United Nations\u2019 annual climate negotiations to follow on the Paris accord start next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. In the months after, all countries including the U.S. must issue national plans showing how they will increase efforts to limit heat-trapping emissions from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "\u201cBaku will be the earliest test of the resilience of the global climate regime,\u201d said Asia Society Policy Institute Director Li Shuo, who foresees the European Union and China stepping up to fill the U.S. leadership void, especially economically. \u201cIt should also unite other countries.\u201d",
      "It sort of did that in 2017, when Trump announced that the U.S. would abandon the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\"Not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,\" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G. \"We saw the birth and launch of the We Are Still In movement of subnational actors, investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Meyer and others said a more serious step than withdrawing from Paris is possible. That would be pulling out of an underlying treaty from 1992 that set curbing climate change and saving biodiversity as part of global environmental goals for the 21st century, as well as withdrawing from the United Nations climate change fighting system that fosters negotiations, records emissions and what's being done about them.",
      "Project 2025, a conservative post-election blueprint that the Trump campaign distanced itself from but was written by his allies, called for withdrawing from both that U.N. framework and the Paris Agreement.",
      "In 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush signed the Rio conventions, which set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That eventually led to agreements in Kyoto and Paris. The Rio agreement was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate, but senators soundly rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of it.",
      "When negotiators were crafting the 2015 Paris deal, they made it voluntary and made it part of the Rio treaty so no Senate approval was needed. That allowed President Joe Biden in 2021 to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement without Senate approval.",
      "It's not straightforward, but an exit from Rio and the UNFCCC could make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to get back into climate negotiations, Meyer said.",
      "David Waskow, international climate director for World Resources Institute, agreed. He said withdrawal from the U.N. agreement \u201cwould not only place the U.S. on the sidelines of international climate discussions but would be like ejecting itself from the stadium.\u201d",
      "The Paris agreement calls for nations to submit new and more aggressive plans to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases every five years. Those are due next February and the Biden administration has promised to submit one before it ends \u201cto show what should be done, what can be done,\u201d Meyer said. But the assumption is that the new Trump administration won't honor it, he said.",
      "Meyer said the United States pulling out of climate agreements in Republican administrations and then trying to lead the world in Democratic ones is like the Peanuts cartoon when Lucy keeps pulling the football away from Charlie Brown.",
      "\u201cThe world has gotten tired of this routine,\u201d Meyer said.",
      "Joanna Depledge, a historian of international climate negotiations, said she expected Trump's new term will mean four lost years for U.S. climate action. But she added: \u201cThe rest of the world is used to U.S. flip-flopping now and will not be diverted from their own efforts.\u201d",
      "Because of the 2020 pandemic and the timing of deadlines created by the Paris Agreement, the three United Nations climate negotiations that took place during the first Trump administration weren\u2019t as ambitious as they could have been. Now, urgent action is needed at the summit this year and next, Depledge and others said.",
      "U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said negotiations continue because \u201cthe fundamental facts remain unchanged: global heating is already hammering every nation, hitting national and households budgets harder every year.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration will still represent the United States next week, when crucial negotiations will address financial help that poor nations need to cope with and fight climate change. But Harris' loss undercuts negotiations because \u201ceveryone there knows\" the U.S. is unlikely to follow through on any agreement it signs, Stanford's Jackson said.",
      "One of the dynamics of past negotiations during Democratic regimes was that any U.S.-China deal usually led to a global one. Usually the United States \u201cis able to nudge\u201d a more reluctant China to be more ambitious about fighting climate change, Asia Society's Li Shuo said.",
      "\u201cBeijing will read the air in Washington and their conclusion is climate does not enjoy the same level of momentum it had a couple of years ago,\u201d Li said.",
      "But despite all this, many in the insular world of climate negotiations somehow keep optimistic.",
      "\u201cThere is an antidote to doom and despair,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said. \u201cIt's action on the ground and it's happening in all corners of the Earth.\u201d",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Josh Allen expects more out of Buffalo\u2019s offense than he saw Sunday at Indianapolis.",
      "He couldn\u2019t have asked for anything more from the Bills' defense.",
      "Taron Johnson picked off Joe Flacco\u2019s first pass and returned it 23 yards for a touchdown, and Allen and James Cook each ran for scores as the Bills beat the Colts 30-20 for their fifth consecutive win.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to have a faster start. We didn\u2019t play our best today, but we\u2019ll take the win,\u201d Allen said. \u201dFour forced turnovers \u2014 we\u2019ve got to hold onto the ball a little bit better. We\u2019ll take them how we can get them, and we\u2019ll turn the page tomorrow.\u201d",
      "The AFC East-leading Bills have topped 30 points in four straight games and improved to 8-2 for the first time since 1993. They earned their first win at Indianapolis since 1998 with Allen's receiving corps depleted by injuries.",
      "The defense delivered for the Bills this time, logging four sacks, picking off Flacco three times and recovering a fumble by Flacco to put Allen in position to cash in.",
      "\u201cI thought the defense, the takeaways was a big-time difference in the game,\u201d coach Sean McDermott said. \u201cI think they\u2019re just a very competitive group, they take a lot of pride in not letting each other down.\u201d",
      "Allen finished 23 of 37 for 280 yards with two interceptions while running eight times for 50 yards and his 57th career rushing TD to tie the late O.J. Simpson for No. 2 in Bills history. Cook had 19 carries 19 for 80 yards. Mack Hollins caught six passes for 86 yards.",
      "Meanwhile, Buffalo's defense forced the 39-year-old Flacco into multiple mistakes and negated Jonathan Taylor in the second half after he rushed for more than 100 yards before halftime. Taylor wound up with 21 carries for 114 yards while rookie receiver Adonai Mitchell had his best game of the season \u2014 six receptions, 71 yards.",
      "It wasn't enough to prevent the Colts (4-6) from losing their third straight or preventing Flacco from getting booed as he went 26 of 35 for 272 yards, two touchdowns and the three picks. He has six turnovers in his two starts since replacing the benched Anthony Richardson. Flacco is 1-3 as Indy's starter this season, failing to recapture the form he had last year when he led the Browns to the playoffs.",
      "\u201cThe first one was just an awful decision,\u201d Flacco said. \u201cThe toughest thing about not playing well is just your mentality and having to deal with the fact that you're not playing well and the best way to do that is to go back to work.\u201d",
      "Just seven plays after Johnson's pick-6, Flacco was intercepted again near midfield and the Bills quickly converted that takeaway into a field goal and a 10-0 lead.",
      "The Colts responded with Taylor's 59-yard run, which set up the first of two field goals by Matt Gay. After Indy's defense stopped the Bills on fourth down, Flacco capitalized with a 2-yard TD pass to Tyler Goodson.",
      "Allen's interception on the Bills' ensuing series set up the field goal that gave Indy a 13-10 lead, but Allen quickly regained control with his 13-yard TD run. Tyler Bass made field goals for Buffalo at the end of the first half and early in the fourth quarter, and Cook sealed the win with a 2-yard TD run early in the fourth.",
      "\u201cI threw two interceptions, can\u2019t do that. We can be cleaner, that\u2019s on me. We\u2019ve got to play better on offense,\u201d Allen said. \u201cThe defense played awesome. We gritted it out and that was a team win right there.\u201d",
      "When the Bills needed a fourth-down conversion in the fourth quarter, Allen took matters into his own hands with a 5-yard run. But as Allen plowed forward for the first down, Colts defensive lineman Dayo Odeyingbo threw three punches in the scrum.",
      "No penalty was called, but Odeyingbo could hear from the league office this week.",
      "The Bills opened the game without two injured receivers, rookie Keon Coleman and the recently acquired Amari Cooper. They also lost TE Dalton Kincaid (knee) during the game. RT Spencer Brown left briefly with an ankle injury.",
      "Indy also deactivated its top receiver, Michael Pittman Jr. (back), and wound up playing three rookie offensive linemen after LT Bernhard Raimann left in the first half with a knee injury.",

      "\u201cI really, really wanted a chance to redeem myself,\" said Moody, who in his first game back after being sidelined three weeks with a sprained ankle, also kicked field goals of 28 and 33 yards for the defending NFC champion 49ers (5-4), who have won consecutive games for the first time this season.",
      "\u201cI felt really confident, really good going that direction. It was the same exact spot as the previous one,\u201d Moody said. \u201cI saw what happened with the previous one and was able to make an adjustment.\u201d",
      "Moody, who was 13 of 14 entering Sunday, delivered the winner after missing wide left from 49 and 50 yards and then wide right on a 44-yard attempt that would have given San Francisco a six-point lead with 3:09 remaining.",
      "TV cameras caught 49ers wide receiver Deebo Samuel exchanging words and appearing to shove long snapper Taybor Pepper when the frustrated wide receiver approached Moody on the sideline after the third miss.",

      "\u201cIt's an emotional game. Stuff like that happens all the time,\" Moody said, adding he\u2019s not looking for an apology from Samuel. \"You just move past it. We won, so that's all that matters.",
      "\u201cLike I said, heat of the moment, it happens. I do have to make those kicks at the end of the day. That's all I'm focused on.\u201d",

      "\u201cGuys are frustrated, something probably happened ... brothers scuffle a little bit.

He carried for 5 yards on the first play and game and finished with 39 yards rushing on 13 attempts. The 2023 AP Offensive Player of the Year also had six receptions for 68 yards.",
      "Baker Mayfield led a drive to set up a tying field goal for Tampa Bay (4-6) with help from three straight personal foul penalties \u2014 setting the stage for Moody to win it for the 49ers. Mayfield finished 18 of 29 passing for 116 yards and one TD for the Bucs, who have lost four in a row.",
      "It was the second straight week Tampa Bay lost on the final play of the game. They forced overtime at Kansas City the previous game, then lost 36-30 when Patrick Mahomes led the Super Bowl champion Chiefs to a touchdown on the first possession of OT.",
      "\u201cWe have to finish ballgames,\u201d Bucs coach Todd Bowles said. \u201cThere's nothing wrong with how hard we're playing and how tough we're playing, but we have to finish games. ... We're making too many mistakes at the end.\u201d",
      "Brock Purdy threw for 353 yards without an interception, and had touchdowns of 46 yards to rookie Ricky Pearsall \u2014 the wide receiver's first NFL score \u2014 and 11 yards to George Kittle. He moved his team into position for the winning field goal with two completions to Jauan Jennings and two more to Pearsall.",
      "Pearsall sat out the first six games after being shot in the chest after an autograph session in downtown San Francisco on Aug. 31. On his touchdown, he caught a pass over the middle from Purdy, accelerated toward the left sideline where he outran the pursuit until safety Antoine Winfield Jr. closed in and nearly brought him down as the receiver extended the ball over the goal line.",
      "The Bucs wiped out a 10-0 deficit with help from 49ers punt returner Jacob Cowing, whose third-quarter muff was recovered at San Francisco's 21 to set up Tampa Bay's first TD. Four plays later, Mayfield threw a 9-yard scoring pass to Rachaad White that made it 10-10.",
      "Rookie Bucky Irving scored on 12-yard run that put Tampa Bay ahead 17-13 early in the fourth quarter. Purdy answered with his TD throw to Kittle to put the 49ers back in front with just over seven minutes left.",

      "There were no wins.",
      "For only the second time, the other being Oct. 10, 2020, the state saw its seven FBS programs \u2014 Miami, Florida, Florida State, UCF, South Florida, Florida Atlantic and Florida International \u2014 combine to go 0-5 on the same day.",
      "It all happened Saturday: Miami watched its unbeaten start end with a 28-23 loss to Georgia Tech, Florida State lost 52-3 to Notre Dame, Florida lost to Texas 49-17, South Florida lost 28-7 to Navy and UCF lost 35-31 to Arizona State.",

      "\u201cWe have a ton of young talent that I think will continue to develop,\u201d Florida coach Billy Napier said after losing to Texas. \"They\u2019re learning, they\u2019re going through this experience, and I think that will prove beneficial in the future.\u201d",
      "Add up the records so far this season and the state\u2019s FBS teams are 27-39, a .409 winning percentage. The worst combined record in the era of the state having seven FBS schools came in 2021 when they went 35-51, a .407 winning percentage.",
      "Saturday marked only the sixth time since 1978 that the state\u2019s three traditional top programs \u2014 the Hurricanes, Seminoles and Gators \u2014 lost on the same day. The UCF and USF losses added to the tally, and the news got worse when adding the state\u2019s three FCS teams into the mix.",
      "With Florida A&M, Bethune-Cookman and Stetson, the Sunshine State's record on Saturday fell to 0-8 \u2014 the worst one-day showing in state history by FBS and FCS teams. Florida A&M lost to Prairie View 31-12, Bethune-Cookman fell 25-23 to Southern in five overtimes and previously winless Marist beat Stetson 40-31.",
      "And Saturday wasn't the entire story of the state's lost weekend. The weekend record for Sunshine State schools fell to 0-9 with the inclusion of Florida Atlantic's 49-14 loss to East Carolina on Thursday.",

      "Chiefs linebacker Leo Chenal blocked Broncos kicker Wil Lutz\u2019s 35-yard field goal attempt as time expired, and Kansas City escaped with a 16-14 victory over the Broncos that extended the Super Bowl champs\u2019 winning streak to 15 games",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Chiefs have won just about every way imaginable during a perfect 15-game run that dates to last season: Patrick Mahomes leading last-second touchdown drives, their defense making a stand, and Harrison Butker kicking game-winning field goals.",
      "They added a walk-off block to the list against the Broncos on Sunday.",
      "Leo Chenal was part of a red wave that crashed through the center of the Denver field goal unit, and the Chiefs linebacker got his hand on Wil Lutz's 35-yard attempt as time expired, allowing Kansas City to escape with a 16-14 victory.",
      "\u201cIt's a complete shock, you know? Not much I can say about it,\" Chenal said. \u201cI was really praying for something to happen. That moment is so heavy. There's a second on the clock, they're going to kick a field goal and you feel the weight of the moment.\u201d",
      "Chiefs coach Andy Reid indicated they took advantage of something they had seen in the Broncos' field-goal operation.",
      "\u201cWe did,\u201d Reid said, \u201cbut it's also something we work on like crazy. It normally doesn't work quite like that one.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs had taken the lead on Butker's field goal with 5:57 remaining, but Bo Nix and the Broncos converted a trio of third downs while marching right back down the field. They proceeded to set up Lutz for the winner, but Chenal came up the middle amid a big push by the Kansas City defensive line to get his hand on the kick.",
      "The ball squibbed away toward the Denver sideline as the Chiefs rushed onto the field to celebrate.",
      "\u201cI felt like we outplayed them but we didn't finish,\u201d Broncos coach Sean Payton said. \u201cThat one will take a while. It'll sting.\u201d",
      "Mahomes finished with 266 yards passing and a touchdown for the Chiefs, who became only the fifth Super Bowl champion to win its first nine games the next season. That also matches the best start to a season in franchise history, and their 15-game win streak dating to last season is the longest in the NFL since the Packers won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Travis Kelce had eight catches for 64 yards and a touchdown for Kansas City. DeAndre Hopkins caught four passes for 56 yards, and Kareem Hunt was held to 35 yards rushing but also caught seven passes for 65 yards.",
      "\u201cAny way you win is good in this league,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cYou live for these moments. When you grow up playing football, you live for the walk-off whatever-it-is. And I'm glad we get to experience it together.\u201d",
      "Nix finished with 215 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Broncos (5-5). Courtland Sutton had six catches for 60 yards and a score. And their 13-yard hookup on third-and-6 with 1:45 left is what gave Denver a chance to kick as time expired.",
      "\u201cThey just made one extra play. When we thought it was in our hands, it wasn't,\u201d Nix said. \u201cIt's tough. And again, it's two good football teams out there playing against each other, and one day it will go our way.\u201d",
      "The Broncos stunned the Chiefs a year ago, forcing five turnovers in a 21-9 win at Denver that ended a 16-game losing streak in the series. And they clearly had the same intention in mind as the AFC West rivals met again Sunday.",
      "Their defense harassed Mahomes throughout the first half, particularly when an injury to Wanya Morris forced rookie left tackle Kingsley Suamataia into the game. And the Broncos capitalized on offense with two long scoring drives, the first ending with Nix finding Devaughn Vele wide open and the second with Sutton's 32-yard TD catch for a 14-3 lead.",
      "It was Mahomes who got the Chiefs on track, going 7 for 7 for 62 yards on the ensuing drive. When it looked as if it had stalled at the Denver 2, Reid went against his conservative nature on fourth down, and Mahomes hit Kelce for the score.",
      "The Chiefs still trailed 14-10 at the break, meaning they had Denver right where they wanted them.",
      "Unflappable in winning its last eight games when trailing in the second half, Kansas City closed within 14-13 on Butker's chip-shot field goal late in the third quarter. The Chiefs defense then forced back-to-back punts, and Mahomes and the offense drove to the Denver 2, where Butker added the go-ahead kick with just under six minutes remaining.",
      "Plenty of time for the Broncos to drive down the field. Not enough time for them to win.",
      "\u201cI told our team I was proud of the way they fought. I thought we outplayed them,\" Payton said. \u201cBut nonetheless, you have to beat a champion and we weren't able to do it, so obviously gut-wrenching.\u201d",
      "Taylor Swift was back at Arrowhead Stadium to watch Kelce and the Chiefs just six days after turning up to see their win over Tampa Bay on Monday night. The pop superstar resumes her Eras Tour on Thursday night at Rogers Centre in Toronto.",
      "Chiefs: Morris hurt his knee in the first half but returned early in the fourth quarter.",
      "Denver plays Atlanta next Sunday.",
      "Kansas City visits Buffalo the same day.",

    "summary": "Russell Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter to lift the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Ja...",

      "Russell Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter to lift the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Ja...",
      "LANDOVER, Md. -- Anyone who questioned Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin's switch to Russell Wilson from Justin Fields might be reconsidering the wisdom of the move right about now. Wilson is looking like the guy who was a star earlier in his career \u2014 especially with those 50-50 deep balls he keeps connecting on.",
      "Wilson shook off his first interception in 11 months and hit trade-deadline pickup Mike Williams for a 32-yard touchdown with less than 2 1/2 minutes left in the fourth quarter for the quarterback's third scoring throw Sunday, lifting the Pittsburgh Steelers to a 28-27 comeback victory over Jayden Daniels and the Washington Commanders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen it a few times on highlights,\u201d Tomlin said of Wilson's ability to complete the big play, something that helped the QB win one Super Bowl and reach another with the Seattle Seahawks. \u201cIt\u2019s a little better in person. Believe me.\u201d",
      "Coming off a bye, the AFC North-leading Steelers (7-2) won their fourth game in a row, including all three since Wilson took over from Fields. Wilson's stats were not the prettiest on Sunday, but he got the job done: 14 for 28 for 195 yards, the three TDs and the one pick.",
      "\u201cIt was a big-time catch by Mike. I just tried to give him a chance, let him do his thing,\u201d Wilson said about Williams, acquired last week from the New York Jets. \u201cYou visualize those moments and what could happen and just trusting guys. That was all Big Mike there.\u201d",
      "George Pickens delivered an acrobatic catch in the end zone on a 16-yarder in the first quarter, and tight end Pat Freiermuth scored on a pass from 3 yards out in the second, much to the delight of the thousands of Terrible Towel-twirling Steelers fans in the stands.",
      "Washington (7-3) led 24-14 but couldn't hold on as it attempted to get to 8-2 overall for the first time since 1986 and 5-0 at home for the first time since 1991, when the team went on to win the Super Bowl under coach Joe Gibbs.",
      "\u201cToo many small mistakes,\u201d defensive end Clelin Ferrell said.",
      "Daniels, the No. 2 overall draft pick who has starred for first-year coach Dan Quinn, was 17 for 34 for 202 yards without a touchdown or interception. He also had three carries for 5 yards, his lowest output as a pro, while still dealing with a rib injury that he described as \u201cstill there, but it's nothing that's holding me back.\u201d",
      "As for watching his counterpart Wilson, Daniels observed: \u201cHe made plays when the plays needed to be made.\u201d",
      "Never more so than on the over-the-shoulder toss to Williams \u2014 his only catch of the game \u2014 to turn a six-point deficit into a one-point lead for the visitors.",
      "Pickens' take on what Wilson showed there?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of his biggest components of his game: trusting his receivers,\u201d Pickens said.",
      "After that play, Daniels moved Washington to midfield. On fourth-and-9 with less than 1 1/2 minutes to go, Daniels connected with Zach Ertz, but the catch was ruled just short of a first down; until then, the Commanders were 11 for 11 on fourth down this season.",
      "On the ensuing possession, Pittsburgh faced a fourth-and-1 at Washington's 49 with 1:02 on the clock and decided to line up as if to go for it. But Wilson's hard count got rookie defensive lineman Johnny Newton to jump too soon, and the penalty allowed the Steelers to keep the ball and run out the clock.",
      "This was far from a perfect performance by Pittsburgh, though.",
      "Commanders safety Jeremy Chinn picked off Wilson late in the third quarter and recovered Jaylen Warren's fumble at the 1-yard line in the fourth.",
      "The worst turnover by the Steelers had to be the fake punt deep in its own territory in the first quarter. The snap went to up-back Miles Killebrew, who threw to a wide-open James Pierre, but he dropped the ball. That gave Washington possession at Pittsburgh's 15, and three plays later, Austin Ekeler scored the first of his two short touchdowns runs.",
      "\u201cThat is me. I own that. I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Tomlin said. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t execute it, so it was a bad idea.\u201d",
      "Steelers: LB Alex Highsmith (ankle) and CB Donte Jackson (hamstring) got hurt in the second half.",
      "Commanders: C Tyler Biadasz (ankle) left the game briefly but returned. ... RT Andrew Wylie (shoulder) was a late scratch, while newly acquired CB Marshon Lattimore (hamstring), RB Brian Robinson Jr. (hamstring) and K Austin Seibert (hip) sat out, as expected. ... Seibert's replacement, Zane Gonzalez, made two field goals.",
      "Steelers: Host division rival Baltimore next Sunday.",

      "Joey Logano won his third NACAR championship Sunday with a relentless drive at Phoenix Raceway that gave Team Penske its third major motorsports title in less than a month",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- Eliminated from the playoffs at the end of the second round, Joey Logano received a second chance when another competitor was disqualified.",
      "He pounced on the opportunity.",
      "Logano was added to the round of eight following Alex Bowman's disqualification and immediately went to Las Vegas Motor Speedway to win the third-round opener. It made Logano the first driver locked into Sunday's winner-take-all finale at Phoenix Raceway with three weeks to prepare his Ford for the title run.",
      "He capitalized with his his third NACAR Cup Series championship, using a near-flawless drive to hold off teammate Ryan Blaney and give Team Penske its third major motorsports title in less than a month and third consecutive NASCAR title.",
      "Logano actually called his shot after qualifying second Saturday when he confidently acknowledged it was his Cup Series title to lose.",
      "\u201cYeah, I do. I feel like our car is strong. We got them down now,\u201d Logano boasted. \u201cWe just have to put our foot on their throats. We feel pretty strong about our team, and these type of pressure situations we feel really solid about as far as our team in these moments.\u201d",
      "It may not have been how boss Roger Penske would have phrased it, but it showed the team owner how relentless his team leader can be.",
      "\u201cI might have used different words, but that\u2019s OK,\" Penske said, \u201cwhen you win, you can say whatever you want, I guess.\u201d",
      "Logano held off Blaney over the final 20 laps to beat him for the Cup series title by 0.330 seconds. Blaney was trying to become the first back-to-back champion since Jimmie Johnson won five straight from 2006 to 2010.",
      "Instead, Logano became the 10th driver in NASCAR history to win three or more championships. Kyle Busch is the only other active driver with multiple titles.",
      "\u201cI love the playoffs, I love it man,\u201d Logano said. \u201cWhat a team, what a Penske battle there at the end. Three of them? That's truly special.\"",
      "It was the first time in Team Penske history the organization finished 1-2 in the championship. And, it came after Penske's sports car team in IMSA won the title last month and his World Endurance Championship team won the title last weekend in Bahrain.",
      "Roger Penske said he worried in the closing laps his two drivers would crash into each other, ending the title hopes for both. He also praised longtime sponsor Shell-Pennzoil, which was on Indianapolis 500 winner Josef Newgarden\u2019s car for his victory in May for Penske.",
      "Penske also deferred taking too much of the credit for the team success.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all about the people,\u201d Penske said. \u201cMy name might be on the door, but it\u2019s all about the people who make the difference and we sure have them on this team.\u201d",
      "Blaney was exhausted after the race, and despite his disappointment was thrilled for the Penske organization.",
      "\u201cAt least a Penske car won it,\u201d Blaney said. \u201cThey put together a great playoffs, and we\u2019re happy. If we\u2019re going to race somebody, I\u2019m happy it was him for the championship, and happy to be 1-2 for Roger, three in a row for Roger, super amazing, and Ford.\u201d",
      "Penske and Ford have won three consecutive Cup Series championships. Logano won in 2022 and Blaney won last year.",
      "\u201cOne-two for Team Penske, three championships in a row, can't be more proud of this team,\u201d Logano said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m the best driver but I\u2019ve got the best team. And together, we\u2019re very well-rounded and can show up when it matters the most.\u201d",
      "The finale was winner-take-all to the highest finisher between Logano, Blaney, William Byron in a Chevrolet for Hendrick Motorsports and Tyler Reddick of the 23XI Racing team owned by NBA Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and three-time Daytona 500 winner Denny Hamlin.",
      "Byron finished third in the race and Reddick was sixth. It was Byron's second consecutive appearance in the finale, first for Reddick.",
      "\u201cMakes you hungrier, but also just more experience in what it takes,\u201d said Byron, the Daytona 500 winner. \u201cI feel like this style of track has been tough on us, and we made a lot of strides this year, but still more to go. If we can just kind of inch up on this style of track, I know we\u2019re so good at all the other ones, and we can put it all together.\u201d",
      "Reddick, who had been subdued all week compared to his fellow title contenders, didn't lead a lap and had Jordan pacing behind the pit wall much of the race.",
      "\u201cMichael was just proud of the effort of our team all year long,\u201d Reddick said. \u201cPut up a good fight. We didn't make any mistakes that took ourselves out of it. We fought as hard as we could.\u201d",
      "The four title contenders finished in the top six, with Reddick behind Kyle Larson of Hendrick and Christopher Bell, who led a race-high 143 laps after he was disqualified from the finale last week at Martinsville for a safety violation. Byron took his spot instead, and Bell insisted he had been cheated out of the chance to race for the title.",
      "Logano, a 34-year-old from Connecticut, led 107 laps in the dominating win that Blaney made closer than expected in the final laps.",
      "But, his very presence in the final four was controversial as Logano was eliminated from the playoffs after the second round. He was reinstated before Las Vegas, where he won to give the No. 22 team three weeks to prepare for Phoenix.",
      "\u201cOur team is better under pressure,\u201d Logano said. \u201cThe race started in Vegas for us. The amount of work and effort that went into building this race car right here, the amount of time, I don\u2019t think anyone works harder than us. We were up at 6 in the morning this morning going over stuff. The guys just want it bad and I\u2019m glad we delivered.\"",

The river is known to be inhabited by saltwater crocodiles and bull sharks.",

      "The two cricket legends, who faced off many times during Ashes series in the late 1980s and early 90s, have maintained a close friendship over the years.",
      "In a comment to News Corp, Botham compared himself to the Australian film character Crocodile Dundee, saying: \u201cAt the end of the day, Crocodile Beefy survived.",
      "\u201cI was out of the water quicker than I went in it. Quite a few sets of eyes were having a peep at me. Luckily I had no time to think about what was in the water. The guys were brilliant, it was just one of those accidents. It was all very quick and I\u2019m OK now.\u201d",

      "\u201cThis is who I am,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cI play the game with fun, joy. I try to surround myself around young people so I can stay young myself, try to be around my kids a lot, my nieces, and sometimes I might go out there at times on the court when I play and do stuff like that, but at the end of the day, as I said, I think he\u2019s an incredible player. He always does the right thing to help his team win. But I\u2019m just going to continue to be me.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, if I\u2019m called a child, so be it. I have three children of my own and I think six nieces. I take care of a lot of kids around here. Sometimes when you\u2019re around a kid, you try to act like a kid. It\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun to be around them. So I just try to go out there and have fun. Again, great player, great competitor. If I have another opportunity, I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d",
      "Antetokounmpo and Brown had another episode in the fourth quarter. After Antetokounmpo drove to the basket with the game tied at 95-all, Brown received a flagrant foul for making significant impact to an airborne player in an unnecessary manner.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 18:02:15 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "Some instructed the recipient to show up at an address at a particular time \u201cwith your belongings,\u201d while others didn't include a location. Some of them mentioned the incoming presidential administration.",
      "It wasn't yet clear who was behind the messages and there was no comprehensive list of where they were sent, but high school and college students were among the recipients.",

      "Tasha Dunham of Lodi, California, said her 16-year-old daughter showed her one of the messages Wednesday evening before her basketball practice.",
      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",

      "Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel said Black students who are members of the organization's Missouri State University chapter received texts citing Trump\u2019s win and calling them out by name as being \u201cselected to pick cotton\u201d next Tuesday. Chapel said police in the southeastern Missouri city of Springfield, home of the university, have been notified.",

      "David Brody, director of the Digital Justice Initiative at The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that they aren\u2019t sure who is behind the messages but estimated they had been sent to more than 10 states, including most Southern states, Maryland, Oklahoma and even the District of Columbia. The district's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement that its intelligence unit was investigating the origins of the message.",

      "\u201cThe threat \u2014 and the mention of slavery in 2024 \u2014 is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \u201cThese actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space station mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month declined to say Friday which one of them was sick.",
      "Astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps publicly discussed their spaceflight for the first time since returning from the International Space Station on Oct. 25. They spent nearly eight months in orbit, longer than expected because of all the trouble with Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule and rough weather, including Hurricane Milton.",

      "\u201cSpaceflight is still something we don\u2019t fully understand. We\u2019re finding things that we don\u2019t expect sometimes. This was one of those times and we\u2019re still piecing things together on this,\" said Barratt, the only member of the crew who had flown in space before.",
      "Epps said everyone is different in how they respond to space -- and gravity.",

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child.

Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia.

Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday morning.",
      "The Rhesus macaque primates escaped from the Alpha Genesis facility Wednesday when a new employee didn't fully shut an enclosure, Alexander said.",
      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "But rounding up these escapees is taking some more work. Alpha Genesis is taking the lead, setting up traps and using thermal imaging cameras to recapture the monkeys on the run, the chief said.",
      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website. The company did not respond to an email asking about Wednesday's escape.",
      "In 2018, federal officials fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 after dozens of primates escaped as well as for an incident that left a few others without water and other problems with how the monkeys were housed.",
      "Officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d Michael Budkie, the executive director of the group, wrote in the Thursday morning letter."

      "\u201cTesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched,\u201d said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, in a note to investors. \u201cThis dynamic could give Musk and Tesla a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment, coupled by likely higher China tariffs that would continue to push away cheaper Chinese EV players.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",
      "It said the company shared the data with around 4,000 advertisers.",
      "South Korea\u2019s privacy law provides strict protection for information related to personal beliefs, political views and sexual behavior, and bars companies from processing or using such data without the specific consent of the person involved.",

      "The company categorized ads to identify users interested in themes such as specific religions, same-sex and transgender issues, and issues related to North Korean escapees, said Lee Eun Jung, a director at the commission who led the investigation on Meta.",
      "\u201cWhile Meta collected this sensitive information and used it for individualized services, they made only vague mentions of this use in their data policy and did not obtain specific consent,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Lee also said Meta put the privacy of Facebook users at risk by failing to implement basic security measures such as removing or blocking inactive pages. As a result, hackers were able to use inactive pages to forge identities and request password resets for the accounts of other Facebook users. Meta approved these requests without proper verification, which resulted in data breaches affecting at least 10 South Korean Facebook users, Lee said.",
      "In September, European regulators hit Meta with over $100 million in fines for a 2019 security lapse in which user passwords were temporarily exposed in an un-encrypted form.",

      "The Canadian government is ordering the dissolution of TikTok\u2019s Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind the social media app but said it won\u2019t block access",
      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",
      "A TikTok spokesperson said in a statement that the shutdown of its Canadian offices will mean the loss of hundreds of local jobs.",
      "\u201cWe will challenge this order in court,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe TikTok platform will remain available for creators to find an audience, explore new interests and for businesses to thrive.\u201d",
      "TikTok is wildly popular with young people, but its Chinese ownership has raised fears that Beijing could use it to collect data on Western users or push pro-China narratives and misinformation. TikTok is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company that moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2020.",
      "TikTok faces intensifying scrutiny from Europe and America over security and data privacy. It comes as China and the West are locked in a wider tug of war over technology ranging from spy balloons to computer chips.",
      "Canada previously banned TikTok from all government-issued mobile devices. TikTok has two offices in Canada, one in Toronto and one in Vancouver.",
      "Michael Geist, Canada research chair in Internet and E-commerce Law at the University of Ottawa, said in a blog post that \"banning the company rather than the app may actually make matters worse since the risks associated with the app will remain but the ability to hold the company accountable will be weakened.\u201d",
      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "Trump tried to ban TikTok through an executive order that said \u201cthe spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned\u201d by Chinese companies was a national security threat. The courts blocked the action after TikTok sued.",
      "Both the U.S. FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that ByteDance could share user data such as browsing history, location and biometric identifiers with China\u2019s government. TikTok said it has never done that and would not, if asked.",
      "Trump said earlier this year that he still believes TikTok posed a national security risk, but was opposed to banning it.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden signed legislation in April that would force ByteDance to sell the app to a U.S. company within a year or face a national ban. It\u2019s not clear whether that law will survive a legal challenge filed by TikTok or that ByteDance would agree to sell.",

      "Some Democrats hoped the justice would resign so Biden could pick a successor.",
      "Despite urgent speculation in liberal legal circles and some talk among Democratic senators of potentially outright urging Justice Sonia Sotomayor to resign, sources close to the senior liberal justice have told ABC News that she is not expected to step down in the middle of the term because of the 2024 election results.",
      "Sotomayor, 70, is in good health and a vigorous participant in the court's work. She is well below the average retirement age of 75, and her diabetes, which she has had since childhood, remains well-managed.",
      "Justices are appointed for life and have generally chafed at public pressure campaigns to step aside. Among other considerations, bowing to public pressure could further politicize the court's image and would likely be a major concern, several court analysts have said.",
      "Sotomayor, the first Latina on the high court bench, has embraced her role as the chief counterweight to the conservative majority and made clear she has plenty of fight left to give.",
      "Speaking at Harvard in May, Sotomayor, who was nominated to the court by then-President Barack Obama, said that while \u201cevery loss truly traumatizes me in my stomach and in my heart,\" she chooses to \"keep on fighting.\"",
      "\u201cThere are moments when I\u2019m deeply, deeply sad,\u201d she said at Harvard. \u201cAnd there are moments when, yes, even I feel desperation. We all do. But you have to own it. You have to accept it. You have to shed the tears, and then you have to wipe them and get up and fight some more.\u201d",
      "Still, many Democrats are reeling from the late 2020 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg from liver cancer at 87, handing a choice opportunity to then-President Donald Trump to nominate his third justice to the high court. Ginsburg had been in poor health for years and passed up the chance to retire earlier and have Obama nominate her replacement.",
      "Forcing out Sotomayor, assuming she would agree to go, could be politically risky, and a successful confirmation before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, logistically impossible. Those realities have seemed to be sinking in among some key Democratic players.",
      "On NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Sen. Bernie Sanders said that he doesn't \"think it\u2019s a sensible approach\" when asked about whether he thought Sotomayor should be pressured by Democrats to step aside.",

      "\"What you're hearing from Donald Trump is he is going to be a president for all Americans. He is a guy who, in that first term, he had crowds chanting 'lock her up' for Hillary Clinton. He didn't prosecute her. I think Donald Trump is focused on what makes people's lives better. And actually, my message to Democrats out there, even those who didn't vote for Donald Trump, is to give him a chance to actually make your life better,\" Ramaswamy said.",
      "\"I think it's time to turn the page on a lot of these histrionics, or Hitler comparisons,\" he added, before later saying that \"success is unifying. Nothing's going to unite this country more than economic growth.\"",
      "Ramaswamy ran against the former and now president-elect in the 2024 GOP primary as a culture warrior in Trump's image, though he ended his campaign the night of the Iowa caucuses and endorsed the former president.",
      "On Sunday, he also defended Trump's vow for a mass deportation force, predicting that the tougher enforcement measures will also lead to undocumented immigrants leaving the country on their own.",
      "\"Donald Trump's campaign promise was the largest mass deportation in American history, and he's going to keep that promise,\" Ramaswamy said. \"Not an iota, not a cent of government spending should go to subsidize this, not to sanctuary cities, not to federal aid to people who are in this country illegally, and we're going to see a large number, by the millions, of self-deportations as well.\"",
      "Pressed by Karl on the fate of the so-called \"Dreamers\" -- people who were brought to the United States as children without valid documentation -- Ramaswamy declined to explicitly say how the incoming administration would approach this group of undocumented immigrants, which includes many adults who have spent most of their life in the U.S. During his first term, the Trump administration attempted to rescind the Obama-era program that allowed such migrants to stay and work in the country.",
      "\"I say this as the kid of legal immigrants to this country, as the proud child of legal immigrants to the United States of America. If your first act of entering this country broke the law, that doesn't allow you to remain in this country,\" Ramaswamy said. \"One is, no migration without consent. Think about your nation like a body. Number two is that consent should only be granted, and should be granted to migrants who benefit the United States of America. But those who enter without consent must be removed.\"",
      "As a vocal Trump ally, Ramaswamy is thought of as a potential future member of the Trump administration, though he did not specify what role would interest him.",
      "\"There's a couple great options on the table. I want to have the biggest possible impact on this country. We're not going to sort that out in the press\u2026 we're having some high-impact discussions.\"",

      "\"Love him or hate him, Trump is a generational candidate,\" one Republican said.",
      "Donald Trump scored a comprehensive victory Tuesday, improving his numbers across several key demographics, possibly sweeping every swing state and clinching the popular vote, which no Republican had done since 2004.",
      "The president-elect, however, says he has run his last race. Term limits will bar him from running again in four years, and Republicans will need to show similar strength in 2026 to maintain their Senate majority and key House seats they were able to secure this year, not to mention the White House again in 2028.",
      "Yet Trump remains a singular figure in Republican politics, and while some lawmakers have been able to find success with their own coalitions, past Trump emulators have failed to capture the same kind of appeal across the political spectrum that he holds -- an appeal that appears to be the dominant force in the modern GOP.",
      "When asked by ABC News whether Trump's coalition can be replicated by others, more than a half-dozen Republican operatives responded with one answer: a resounding maybe.",
      "\"Love him or hate him, Trump is a generational candidate,\" said Tricia McLaughlin, a GOP strategist who worked on Vivek Ramaswamy's presidential campaign. \"That is something in the next three years we have to grapple with.\"",
      "\"I think we're yet to see who that might be,\" she added of who can emulate Trump's 2024 path, \"and I think part of the reason we might not be able to see who that is now, and it might take us a while, is because Donald Trump is the name of the game.\"",
      "The thoroughness of Trump's win left Democrats scratching their heads and gave Republicans a path forward beyond his final term in office, if they're able to capitalize on it.",
      "He appeared on track to take all seven swing states, while staying competitive in deep blue states like New Mexico and New Jersey. He was able to clinch 46% of the Latino vote, won Hispanic men outright and kept his loss to single digits among female voters even amid furor over abortion access, according to exit poll data. And while he expanded the Republican coalition to include more voters of color, he maintained his dominance with white voters.",
      "Now, it's contingent on Republicans, likely with Trump's support, to continue those successes as they work to defend their new Senate majority in 2026, remain competitive for the House and elect another president in four years.",
      "One way, strategists said, is to try to be as legislatively productive as possible while Trump is in the White House. He was elected to change things, they argued, and making those changes will help reinforce the perception of the Republican Party that handed the GOP victories up and down the ballot, benefiting others hitting the campaign trail in their own races.",
      "\"This is not a squeaker of a win, it's a landslide, he has a mandate on the policies he's running on. So, it would be wise for our party to achieve all of that sooner than later, in the first 100 days for Congress to get that together,\" said GOP strategist Kristin Davison. \"To keep the coalition, the first step is to deliver.\"",
      "\"And then, moving forward, we have four years here, and elections during that time and following, to take that message that meets voters where they are,\" Davison added. \"I think where we might make a mistake is where candidates copy and paste. Nobody will be able to be Trump\u2026But to take that message and apply it to their specific state and district and community will be the best way to continue and grow that.\"",
      "To do so, Republican candidates might have to break from traditional GOP orthodoxy in the same way that Trump did. Out are support for free trade and big business benefits, in are \"fair trade\" and policies beneficial to workers.",
      "\"I think it's important to remember that this coalition is built on policy over anything else. Yes, personality helps him build it. But the policy is what builds this coalition,\" said Nick Trainer, a former Trump administration official. \"You have to find your way in, whether that's increased child tax credits or pro-labor stances or whatever it may be, you have to find your way into it. But it's not something where you can be a PowerPoint Republican of yesteryear.\"",
      "It won't be easy.",
      "Past emulators have failed. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' presidential bid flamed out as Trump remained the party leader, and Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is trailing in a state that favored Trump.",
      "Trump has undoubtedly brought more voters into the fold, including some who are thought to not be motivated to vote for anyone besides him. And if there is any hope of Trump's coalition living on in other races, his involvement could be key.",
      "\"There's this fascinating voter out there that is uniquely keyed for Donald Trump, and we may never see them again. They may never vote again in their lives, because I'm convinced that a lot of them never voted before Donald Trump,\" said one GOP strategist who worked on several down-ballot races this year.",
      "\"How do we keep them engaged? How do we keep them motivated to keep coming around?\" the person added. \"I don't know, but that would be one way to replicate it, is if he took an active role in kind of playing kingmaker from this point forward.\"",
      "To be certain, there are other coalitions to be had.",
      "GOP governors like Mike DeWine in Ohio and Brian Kemp in Georgia have won as more traditional Republican lawmakers, at times with margins even more expansive than those Trump won in their states.",
      "But Trump and his coalition are clearly the 800-pound gorilla in Republican politics, and while replicating the president-elect's appeal will be key to Republican success, doing so won't come as naturally to others.",
      "\"It will be extremely difficult,\" the Republican strategist said. \"Doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Doesn't mean that there won't be efforts to do it. But I do think there will be a limit to how successful you're going to be without your name being Donald Trump.\"",

Doug Ducey, said the eight counties that responded \u2014 including Maricopa \u2014 said \u201call such affected voters\u201d received at least one telephone call \u201calong with other messages by emails, text messages or mail.\u201d",

      "Some supporters of abortion still elected Trump in battleground states.",
      "Despite Kamala Harris' loss, pro-abortion rights activists are celebrating the results of the 2024 election, arguing that abortion rights won.",
      "\"When we look at the election results from this week, we saw voters in states that are really different from each other, in large majorities support abortion rights,\" Elisabeth Smith, the director of state policy at the Center for Reproductive Rights, told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Abortion was a central issue in Harris's campaign as she sought to draw a stark difference between her vision for the country and President-elect Donald Trump's. But, exit polling shows some supporters of abortion rights still voted for Trump, despite Roe v. Wade being overturned as a result of his U.S. Supreme Court appointments.",
      "The battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada were among 10 states with abortion on the ballot Tuesday. Some strategists hypothesized that this would boost turnout among the majority of voters who support legal abortion, aiding Democratic candidates in the process.",
      "Trump's approach, focusing on states' rights, appeared to resonate with voters who didn't view abortion access as incompatible with a Trump presidency. In Arizona, 23% who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution also voted for Trump. In Nevada, where another abortion rights measure was approved, 27% of \"yes\" voters elected Trump.",
      "This followed at the national level. Among the two-thirds of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases, 28% voted for Trump; that included 30% in Arizona, 33% in Nevada and 36% in Florida.",
      "Supporters of legal abortion still broke strongly for Harris, but partisan elasticity on the issue did not cut both ways. As Harris made abortion access a central focus of her campaign, she won only 9% of voters who said abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. In Arizona, anti-abortion voters made up 31% of the electorate and backed Trump by 95%.",
      "\"In thinking about what seems like a contradiction, research has shown that Americans -- when there is an abortion ballot or abortion-protecting constitutional amendment or initiative on the ballot -- they don't see abortion as a partisan issue,\" Smith said. \"Americans see abortion as an issue of liberty and of freedom.\"",
      "\"In 2022, 10% of voters in the state of Kentucky voted against the restrictive constitutional amendment that was on their ballot and for Rand Paul -- a senator who has made his opposition to abortion rights known,\" Smith said.",
      "Trump has also told voters that there won't be a federal abortion ban and it could be that voters were persuaded by him, Smith said.",
      "\"I don't think that people know that a federal abortion ban would preempt state constitutional protection. So I think there could also be this sense 'I'm voting yes on this amendment, and that means my state is fine,'\" Smith said.",
      "At least 14 states have ceased nearly all abortion services since Roe v. Wade was overturned. In total, 21 states have restrictions on abortion in effect.",
      "Seven of the 10 states with abortion on the ballot are projected to vote in favor of abortion rights while three states are projected to uphold abortion restrictions -- marking a first since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Six states previously voted in favor of abortion rights in the 2022 midterm elections.",
      "In Florida, 57% of voters voted in favor of enshrining protections for abortion rights in the state's constitution, but the measure failed to reach the 60% threshold it needed to pass. Still, abortion rights groups dubbed this measure a success, saying a majority of voters sided with abortion.",
      "\"Abortion won big,\" said Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, at a press conference Wednesday. \"If not for the rigged rules and for the very intentional and purposeful efforts to confuse and mislead voters and change the goal post and change the rules, abortion access would have won, certainly in Florida but in Nebraska and South Dakota too.\"",
      "In Nebraska, two contradicting abortion-related amendments on the ballot confused voters, likely contributing to the failure of the initiative, Smith argued.",
      "\"There is research, outside of the abortion context, but about ballot initiatives that show that when voters are confronted with two choices on the same question, that creates a lot of confusion about what people are voting for. And in Nebraska, when signatures were being collected, there were voters who alleged that they were told they were signing the abortion rights petition and later found out they had signed the petition against abortion rights,\" Smith said.",
      "Despite the success of ballot initiatives, advocates need to make it more understandable to people that their elected officials greatly determine their ability to access reproductive healthcare like abortion, Kelly Baden, the Guttmacher Institute's vice president of policy told ABC News in an interview.",
      "\"Women are dying from these abortion bans. And so unfortunately, to to see that that reality wasn't sufficient for people to fully prioritize abortion rates up and down the ballot in every way possible is it's a tough pill to swallow,\" Baden said.",
      "\"Seven states did soundly declare their support for abortion, active rights via ballot measures and I think there's a bigger conversation of how and why people are able to make that make sense in their own voting patterns. That is a problem that predates Trump,\" Baden said.",

      "But the vice presidential nominee notably added that he'd work to find common ground with swaths of people who voted \"for the other side\" on Tuesday and that \"there should be a place in our politics for everyone to be heard.\"",

I don't think that kind of judgment is helpful right now, and I don't think it's right,\" he said, noting that he'd \"try even harder\" to keep an open mind and listen to people who don't support his policies.",

      "Walz's remarks, which capped off his whirwhind three months spent on the campaign trail as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, come as many high-profile Democratic governors already have gone on offense against Trump's coming presidency.",
      "\"As long as I'm governor of Minnesota, we will protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions. As long as I am governor of Minnesota, we will welcome immigrants with gratitude for their contributions to our communities,\" Walz said. \"As long as I'm governor of Minnesota, we will stand with the rest of the world in fighting climate change and developing new clean energy solutions. As long as I'm governor of Minnesota, we'll be a state that respects democracy, a place where we're proud of our civic debate and where we don't demonize people who disagree with us,\" he said.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro have all come out with official stances or proposed ways to counter Trump.",

      "Newsom on Thursday called a special session of the state Legislature to increase funding for the California Department of Justice and other agencies in order to support their ability to \"immediately\" file litigation to challenge actions taken by a second Trump administration.",
      "The special session -- which will begin Dec. 2, when the Legislature convenes -- will also focus on protecting abortion access, climate and immigration policy and civil rights.",
      "\"The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack -- and we won't sit idle. California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond. We are prepared, and we will do everything necessary to ensure Californians have the support and resources they need to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "In New York, Hochul on Wednesday announced a new 'Empire State Freedom Initiative,' which she said started prior to Election Day and has already begun developing plans to address any impending Trump Administration policies on reproductive rights, civil rights, immigration, gun safety, labor rights, LGBTQ rights and environmental justice, among other topics.",
      "\"The safety and wellbeing of New Yorkers are my top priorities,\" Hochul said. \"I'm committed to working with anyone on policies that make our state stronger, safer and more livable \u2014 but my administration will also be prepared to protect New Yorkers' fundamental freedoms from any potential threats.\"",
      "Appearing on Thursday to announce New York's strategy with Attorney General Letitia James, Hochul also said her administration would have a strengthened relationship with AG's office, which will have new dedicated staff to address potential federal legal threats.",
      "\"We faced this challenge before, and we use the rule of law to fight back. And we are prepared to fight back once again, because as the attorney general of this great state, it is my job to protect and defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law, and I will not shrink from that responsibility,\" James said.",
      "In Massachusetts, Healey, who as Massachusetts' attorney general during the first Trump administration filed dozens of lawsuits against it, told MSNBC on Wednesday that she expects litigation will be filed if Trump proceeds with his mass deportation proposals but that there's also \"regulatory authority and executive powers and the like -- there's legislation also within our state\" that could work against potential threats.",
      "\"Some realities need to be noted and that is in 2016, we had a different situation in the courts, and I am sure there may be litigation ahead, there is a lot of other ways people are going to act and need to act for the sake of their states and residents,\" she said.",
      "She also said that her state police will \"absolutely not\" be cooperating with mass deportations, but that she would use \"every tool in the toolbox\" to \"protect\" residents.",

I was not unprepared, having fought through the headwinds of the first Trump administration, the General Assembly and I took proactive steps to plan for the potential of a second Trump presidency and protect our residents from the damage that it may attempt to cause,\" Pritzker said during a press availability on Thursday, noting that Illinois had enshrined reproductive rights into the state constitution, reaffirmed labor rights, and advanced climate policy, among other items.",
      "\"Over the years ahead, we'll do more than just protect against the possible reversion to an agenda that threatens to take us backward, we will continue to advance a positive, productive and inclusive agenda of our own, one that brings opportunity to Illinois and helps uplift the nation as a whole,\" he added.",

    "summary": "How accurate were polls of the 2024 election?",
    "story": [
      "A modest error in his favor was enough to sweep the swing states.",
      "Here at 538, we think a big part of our jobs during election season is to explore and explain how much trust you should put in all the people telling you who's going to win. More than anyone else, given the amount of data they produce and the press and public's voracious appetite for it, that includes the pollsters. That's why we do things like publish ratings of pollster accuracy and transparency and make complex election forecasting models to explore what would happen if the polls are off by as much as they have been historically.",
      "Polls are also important for the reporting we do here at 538, which is rooted in empiricism and data. Furthermore, the quality of the data we're getting about public opinion is important not just for predicting election outcomes and doing political journalism, but also for many other parts of our democratic process.",
      "Suffice it to say, if polls are getting more or less accurate, the public needs to know. And now that the 2024 election is in the rearview mirror, we can take a rough first look at how accurate polling was.",
      "Just one note on scope before we get started: In this article, I will be taking just a broad look at how polls did in states where the results are final or nearly final. That means we won't assess the accuracy of national polls yet, given how many votes are still left to count in California and other slow-counting states, and won't be assessing the accuracy of individual pollsters, which we'll do when we update our pollster ratings next spring.",
      "Polls in 2024: Low error, medium bias",
      "Despite the early narrative swirling around in the media, 2024 was a pretty good year to be a pollster. According to 538's analysis of polls conducted in competitive states* in which over 95 percent of the expected vote was counted as of Nov. 8 at 6 a.m. Eastern, the average poll conducted over the last three weeks of the campaign missed the margin of the election by just 2.94 percentage points. In the seven main swing states (minus Arizona, which is not yet at 95 percent reporting), pollsters did even better: They missed the margin by just 2.2 points.",
      "This measure, which we call \"statistical error,\" measures how far off the polls were in each state without regard for whether they systematically overestimated support for one candidate. And by this metric, state-level polling error in 2024 is actually the lowest it has been in at least 25 years. By comparison, state-level polls in 2016 and 2020 had an average error close to 4.7 percentage points. Even in 2012, which stands out as a good year for both polling and election forecasting, the polls missed election outcomes by 3.2 percentage points.",
      "At this early juncture, we can only speculate as to why error was so low this year. One reason could be that pollsters have mostly moved away from conducting polls using random-digit dialing \u2014 a type of polling that has recently tended to generate results that oscillate more wildly from poll to poll than other methods. One notable pollster that does still use RDD is Selzer & Co., which had Vice President Kamala Harris leading President-elect Donald Trump by 3 points in its final poll of Iowa this year. Trump ended up winning the state by about 13 points, making for a 16-point error. It looks possible that Selzer's poll had too many Democrats and college-educated voters in it, factors the firm generally does not attempt to correct for due to Selzer's philosophy of \"keeping [her] dirty hands off the data\" (to be fair, this approach had worked excellently until this year; Selzer is one of the top-rated pollsters in 538's pollster ratings).",
      "Quinnipiac University, which also uses RDD, also generated polls that didn't seem consistent across states, though they ended up being closer to the outcome than Selzer. Meanwhile, other prominent pollsters that previously used RDD have now stopped using the method. That includes ABC News, which, after publishing an RDD poll that found now-President Joe Biden ahead of Trump by 17 points in Wisconsin in 2020 (something the pollsters behind the survey rightly identified as an outlier result when it was published), now sources its polls from Ipsos, which conducts polls online among respondents who are randomly recruited by mail and telephone.",
      "Another factor is that pollsters are increasingly balancing their samples on both demographic and political variables, such as individuals' recalled vote in the last election. While this can cause some strange results, it generally stabilizes the polls and produces fewer outliers than one would expect by random chance alone.",
      "Based on our preliminary findings, pollsters that used this aggressive approach to modeling had lower error than others. While this is just a loose proxy as we conduct a more thorough analysis, we found that pollsters who conducted their surveys with online probability panels, interviewed people with robo-calls, or included text messages or phone calls as part of a bigger mixed-mode sampling design tended to use more complex weighting schemes (and were especially reliant on recalled vote) \u2014 and also had lower error than pollsters using more hands-off modes:",
      "But the news is not all good. While polls had a historically good year in terms of error, they had a medium-to-bad one in terms of statistical bias, which measures whether polls are missing the outcome in the same direction. By our math, state polls overestimated support for Harris by an average of 2.7 points on margin in competitive states.",
      "That's lower than the statistical bias of the polls in 2016 and 2020, which underestimated Trump by 3.2 and 4.1 points, respectively. But it's higher than the bias in the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections.",
      "This is not great news for pollsters. It means they did not fully solve their problems from 2016 and 2020 of getting enough Trump supporters to take their polls . While those problems may have been abated by pollsters weighting their data more aggressively or improving their sampling designs, they are still obviously present. You can really see this if you look at the pattern of polling bias in the competitive states from 2016 to 2024:",
      "While pollsters managed to reduce their bias in some states, especially Wisconsin, from 2020 to 2024, the pattern in the industry is still the same: Pollsters are having a hard time reaching the types of people who support Trump.",
      "You should expect errors in polling",
      "While bias in the polling industry is troubling, it is not necessarily unexpected \u2014 especially after the last few elections. And it's worth repeating that a 3-point error on the margin is indeed very small historically. Political pollsters have designed a tool that, on average, can measure public opinion among hundreds of millions of people to within 1.5 percent of its \"true\" value (converting vote margin to vote share). When you think about it that way, it's actually remarkable that polls are as accurate as they are.",
      "After the 2020 election, a year in which America's pollsters faced their worst performance since 1980, the American Association of Public Opinion Research (the professional society for pollsters and survey researchers) issued a warning to people trying to predict election outcomes in 2022 and 2024. \"Polls are often misinterpreted as precise predictions,\" it said. \"It is important in pre-election polling to emphasize the uncertainty by contextualizing poll results relative to their precision.... Most pre-election polls lack the precision necessary to predict the outcome of semi-close contests.\"",
      "In other words, polls are simply not up to the task of dispositively determining the result of a close race before it happens. In such a case, the margin between candidates would be too small for observers to conclude that one candidate was reliably ahead, given the inherent uncertainty in polling.",
      "Let's put this note of caution in the context of the 2024 election. At first glance, it may seem like polls had a bad year because they pointed to a close election and Trump looks like he will cruise to a 312-226 win in the Electoral College. But as I wrote last week, because he led in the Sun Belt swing states and was tied in Pennsylvania, polls didn't really even need to underestimate Trump at all for him to win the election. And, I warned, if they underestimated him by 2 points \u2014 which would be small compared to other misses historically \u2014 he could sweep all seven swing states.",
      "Well, it looks like that is exactly what happened. In fact, it was the modal outcome in our final forecast. AAPOR's warning is more relevant today than ever.",

      "This comes despite criticism of the Trump campaign demeaning female voters. From Vice President-elect JD Vance's comments of \"childless cat ladies\" to more recent sexist and misogynistic remarks made at Trump rallies, the Republican ticket often sparked outrage from female voters.",

    "story": [
      "The standoff carries high stakes for the U.S. economy, experts said.",
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell struck a defiant tone this week when posed with the question of whether he would resign from his position if asked by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d Powell said, pausing to let the one-word answer register with the reporters assembled at a press conference in Washington, D.C., blocks away from the White House. When asked whether Trump could fire or demote him, Powell retorted: \u201cNot permitted under the law.\u201d",
      "Prominent Trump allies responded within hours. \u201cThe Executive Branch should be under the direction of the president,\u201d Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah posted on X atop a screenshot of Powell\u2019s comments. Lee added: \u201cYet another reason why we should #EndTheFed.\u201d",
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, a top Trump donor, reposted the message from Lee with an emoji appended, indicating Musk\u2019s full support.",
      "The high-stakes standoff has elicited questions about what Trump could do to overcome the Fed\u2019s longstanding independence, whether such maneuvers could prove effective and what it may mean for everyday Americans.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know, according to experts:",
      "What could Trump do to meddle with the Federal Reserve?",
      "The Federal Reserve Act, which founded the central bank in 1913, granted the central bank a measure of independence from the White House.",
      "In actuality, however, the Fed has only enjoyed independence since the early 1950s, when the central bank did away with a policymaking role taken up by the Treasury Department.",
      "Federal law allows the president to remove a Federal Reserve governor, including the Fed chair, \u201cfor cause.\u201d",
      "Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTrump could try and he might try,\u201d Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know what to think of the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed\u2019s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a subtle question that has never been tested,\u201d Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer that quite as definitively.\u201d",
      "If the courts reject Trump or he wants a sure path to the removal of Powell, Trump could push Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act in a manner that weakens or eliminates the Fed\u2019s independence, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something written at the top of Mount Sinai.\u201d",
      "As he did on numerous occasions over his first term, Trump could also try to influence Fed policy through public criticism of the central bank in general and Powell in particular, experts said.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,\" Trump said about interest rate policy during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in August.",
      "Could Trump successfully influence interest rate decisions, and why does it matter?",
      "Experts cast doubt on the prospect of Trump meaningfully influencing the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions, at least in the short term.",
      "The attempted removal of Powell would likely get tied up in the courts for months, if not years, while an effort to pass new legislation would face steep odds in the Senate, where it would need to overcome a 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster, the experts said.",
      "Powell would likely resist a campaign of public pressure undertaken by Trump, just as Powell did the first time around, experts added.",
      "Trump would also face a potentially steep decline in the stock market if he appeared to seriously threaten the independence of the Fed, some experts said. Bank executives and other business leaders would likely voice stiff opposition, fearing economic instability and runaway inflation, they added.",
      "\u201cTrying to overcome Fed independence would be highly disruptive,\u201d said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and co-author of \u201cThe Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.\u201d \u201cI think the market would be an important consideration in all these efforts.\u201d",
      "Trump, however, could simply wait for his opportunity to appoint loyal personnel at the central bank, according to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed official. In 2026, Powell\u2019s term will expire and Trump will appoint a replacement, who will then require Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cFrankly, the easy thing is to wait a year and nominate someone else,\u201d Sahm said.",
      "The status of Fed independence holds important stakes for everyday people, Sahm added. A central bank that lacks independence is more likely to throw its dual mandate of stable inflation and maximum employment out of whack, since politicians tend to prioritize short-term economic performance over long-term steadiness, Sahm said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a central bank that does what the president wants instead of what the economy needs, then we can end up with high inflation, high unemployment and financial instability,\u201d Sahm said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Days before Senate Republicans pick their new leader, President-elect Donald Trump is pressuring the candidates to change the rules and empower him to appoint some nominees without a Senate vote.",
      "Republican Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas and Rick Scott of Florida are running in a secret ballot election Wednesday to lead the GOP conference and replace longtime GOP leader Mitch McConnell, who is stepping aside from the job after almost two decades. All three have courted Trump's support in the race, vying to show who is the closest to the president-elect as they campaign to become majority leader.",
      "Trump has not endorsed in the race, but on Sunday he made clear that he expects the new leader to go around regular Senate order, if necessary, to allow him to fill his Cabinet quickly. In a statement on X and Truth Social, Trump said that the next leader \u201cmust agree\u201d to allow him to make appointments when the chamber is on recess, bypassing a confirmation vote.",
      "\u201cAny Republican Senator seeking the coveted LEADERSHIP position in the United States Senate must agree to Recess Appointments (in the Senate!), without which we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner,\u201d Trump posted, adding that positions should be filled \u201cIMMEDIATELY!\u201d",
      "The Senate has not allowed presidents to make so-called recess appointments since a 2014 Supreme Court ruling limited the president\u2019s power to do so. Since then, the Senate has held brief \u201cpro-forma\u201d sessions when it is out of town for more than 10 days so that a president cannot take advantage of the absence and start filling posts that have not been confirmed.",

      "The social media exchange on Sunday became a first test for the three candidates since Trump was decisively elected last week to a second term.",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Congress \u2014 especially the advice and consent role afforded to the Senate when it comes to nominations \u2014 was tumultuous in his first term as he chafed at resistance to his selections and sought ways to work around lawmakers. With Trump now entering a second term emboldened by his sweeping election victory, he is already signaling that he expects Senate Republicans, and by extension, their new leader, to fall in line behind his Cabinet selections.",
      "Trump also posted on Sunday that the Senate should not approve any judges in the weeks before Republicans take power next year \u2014 a more difficult demand to fulfill as Democrats will control the floor, and hold the majority of votes, until the new Congress is sworn in on Jan. 3. Trump posted that \u201cDemocrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.\u201d",
      "With days to go, the race for Senate Republican leader is deeply in flux.",
      "Thune and Cornyn are both well-liked, longtime senators who have served as deputies to McConnell and have been seen as the front-runners, despite past statements criticizing Trump. Scott \u2014 a longtime friend of Trump\u2019s and fierce ally \u2014 has been seen as more of a longshot, but he has mounted an aggressive campaign in recent days on social media and elsewhere with the aim of getting Trump\u2019s endorsement.",

      "All three candidates are promising that they will be more open and transparent than McConnell was and that they would give senators more power to get their priorities to the floor. They have also tried to make clear that they would have a much different relationship with Trump than McConnell, who once called the former president a \u201cdespicable human being\u201d behind closed doors.",

Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that there are \u201ca couple of great options on the table.\u201d Sen.

      "China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan during a national legislature meeting. The long-anticipated stimulus is designed to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly the growth rocket many had hoped for. While it\u2019s a substantial number, the stimulus is less about jump-starting economic growth and more about plugging holes in a struggling local government system,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.",
      "Meanwhile, China\u2019s inflation rate in October rose 0.3% year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics on Saturday, marking a slowdown from September\u2019s 0.4% increase and dropping to its lowest level in four months.",

      "In the bond market, longer-term Treasury yields eased.",
      "A preliminary report in the morning suggested sentiment among U.S. consumers rose for a fourth straight month to its highest level in six months. The survey from the University of Michigan, which was conducted before Tuesday\u2019s election, also said expectations for inflation in the coming year eased to the lowest level since 2020.",
      "The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 4.30% Friday from 4.33% late Thursday. But it\u2019s still well above where it was in mid-September, when it was close to 3.60%.",
      "Treasury yields climbed in large part because the U.S. economy has remained much more resilient than feared. The hope is that it can continue to stay solid as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in order to keep the job market humming, now that it\u2019s helped get inflation nearly down to its 2% target.",
      "Some of the rise in yields has also been because of Trump. He talks up tariffs and other policies that economists say could drive inflation and the U.S. government\u2019s debt higher, along with the economy\u2019s growth.",
      "Traders have already begun paring forecasts for how many cuts to rates the Fed will deliver next year because of that. While lower rates can boost the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel.",

      "Authorities said firefighters battled fierce, howling winds and rescued people as a fast-moving Southern California wildfire exploded in size",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Fire authorities on Sunday described battling fierce, howling winds and rescuing people in a fast-moving Southern California wildfire that forced thousands of people to flee and destroyed at least 168 structures and damaged 67.",
      "Crews increased containment of the Mountain Fire to 31% in Ventura County northwest of Los Angeles, up from 26% on Sunday morning. The fire's size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers).",
      "\"I am grateful for the number of lives that were saved and the fact that we have zero reported fatalities,\" said an emotional Ventura County Fire Chief Dustin Gardner at a community meeting Sunday night.",
      "\u201cI know we suffered great damage, but thousands of homes were saved and hundreds of lives were rescued. I know we made mistakes, but we will learn from those mistakes,\" he said.",
      "Ventura County public safety officials said they prepared for dry, warm and gusty northeast Santa Ana winds. But the fire that broke out Wednesday morning exploded in size with winds gusting at 80 mph (about 130 kph) and embers that flew from orchards 2-1/2 miles (4 kilometers) away to residential neighborhoods around the community of Camarillo.",
      "The cause of the fire is under investigation. Inspection teams continue to assess damage.",
      "Firefighters made 136 active rescues, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Evacuation orders were downgraded Saturday to warnings for residents in several areas of Ventura County as winds subsided and firefighters were aided by mild temperatures and low humidity.",
      "Agriculture officials assessing the toll on farmland sown with avocado, citrus and berries estimated the damage at $2.4 million, the Ventura County Star reported.",
      "Another round of northeast winds was expected Tuesday, but humidity should rise and gusts are not forecast to surge as high as those that fanned the fire, National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Walbrun said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be nearly as strong as the winds that occurred when this fire started. But for some of you, you\u2019re going to hear that wind and it might trigger you a little bit,\u201d he said.",

      "The Arizona Supreme Court has declined an emergency request to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with mail-in ballots",
      "PHOENIX -- The Arizona Supreme Court declined Sunday to extend the deadline for voters to fix problems with mail-in ballots, a day after voter rights groups cited reports of delays in vote counting and in notification of voters with problem signatures.",
      "The court said Sunday that election officials in eight of the state's 15 counties reported that all voters with \u201cinconsistent signatures\u201d had been properly notified and given an opportunity to respond.",
      "Arizona law calls for people who vote by mail to receive notice of problems such as a ballot signature that doesn\u2019t match one on file and get a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to correct it in a process known as \u201ccuring.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court has no information to establish in fact that any such individuals did not have the benefit of \u2018reasonable efforts\u2019 to cure their ballots,\u201d wrote Justice Bill Montgomery, who served as duty judge for the seven-member court. He noted that no responding county requested a time extension.",
      "\"In short, there is no evidence of disenfranchisement before the Court,\u201d the court order said.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and the Campaign Legal Center on Saturday named registrars including Stephen Richer in Maricopa County in a petition asking for an emergency court order to extend the original 5 p.m. MST Sunday deadline by up to four days. Maricopa is the state\u2019s most populous county and includes Phoenix.",
      "The groups said that as of Friday evening, more than 250,000 mail-in ballots had not yet been verified by signature, with the bulk of those in Maricopa County. They argued that tens of thousands of Arizona voters could be disenfranchised.",
      "Montgomery, a Republican appointed to the state high court in 2019 by GOP former Gov. Doug Ducey, said the eight counties that responded \u2014 including Maricopa \u2014 said \u201call such affected voters\u201d received at least one telephone call \u201calong with other messages by emails, text messages or mail.\u201d",
      "He noted, however, that the Navajo Nation advised the court that the list of tribe members in Apache County who needed to cure their ballots on Saturday was more than 182 people.",
      "Maricopa County reported early Sunday that it had about 202,000 ballots yet to be counted. The Arizona Secretary of State reported that more than 3 million ballots were cast in the election."

      "The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Associated Press declared President-elect Donald Trump the winner in Arizona on Saturday night after vote updates in Maricopa and other counties added to his overall lead, putting the state out of reach for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "At the time the AP called the race at 9:21 p.m. ET, Trump led Harris, 52.6% to 46.4%, a margin of about 185,000 votes. Harris needed to win about seven out of every ten votes of the roughly 443,000 uncounted ballots remaining, a percentage that has steadily grown as additional votes were counted.",
      "Trump has now swept all seven of the hotly contested presidential battlegrounds, winning 312 electoral votes, compared to 226 for Harris. The number needed to clinch the presidency is 270.",
      "In 2020, President Joe Biden carried the state narrowly over Trump, but he won Maricopa County by a margin of 50 percentage points to 48. On Saturday, Trump was leading Harris 52 to 47.",
      "The AP only declares a winner once it can determine that a trailing candidate can\u2019t close the gap and overtake the vote leader.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at how the AP called this race:",
      "CANDIDATES: President: Harris (D) vs. Trump (R) vs. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) vs. Jill Stein (Green).",
      "WINNER: Trump.",
      "POLL CLOSING TIME: 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. Arizona does not release votes until all precincts have reported or one hour after all polls are closed, whichever is first, usually 10 p.m. ET.",
      "ABOUT THE RACE: Both Harris and Trump crisscrossed this border state, where immigration is a prominent issue, multiple times before Election Day.",
      "Trump put immigration at the center of his candidacy, promising to deport people without legal documentation while Harris called for pathways to citizenship as well as tighter security at the border.",
      "Independent voters are the largest bloc in the state, followed by Republicans then Democrats, who have succeeded in winning Senate contests and the governorship since 2018.",
      "Biden became just the second Democrat to win the state in more than 70 years.",
      "Both candidates made a play for vote-rich Maricopa County, which is home to Phoenix, Mesa and Tempe. Trump carried the county by 3 points in 2016, while Biden won with a 2-point margin four years later. Arizona is primarily an early voting state. In 2016, just over three-quarters of the votes were cast early. In 2020, that climbed to nearly 90%.",
      "WHY AP CALLED THE RACE:",
      "In statewide elections going back a dozen years, Democrats have always carried four counties in both winning and losing campaigns: Apache, Coconino, Pima and Santa Cruz.",
      "Harris had large leads over Trump in all four counties, but she far underperformed Biden\u2019s showing from 2020.",
      "She was trailing Trump in decisive Maricopa County, which Biden won in 2020 and has been a must-win county for statewide Democratic candidates in recent elections.",
      "Although Harris very briefly led in the statewide vote count on election night, Trump has consistently led since then.",
      "The AP\u2019s analysis of Arizona's voting history and political demographics at the county level showed there was no scenario that would allow Harris to close the gap. The analysis also showed that even if remaining updates showed vote swings in Harris' favor, they would not be enough to give her the lead.",

      "SEATTLE -- A 37-year-old man who police say stabbed five people in Seattle in broad daylight Friday and possibly four others the day before made his first court appearance Saturday where a judge ordered him held on $2 million bail.",
      "\u201cPeople who live in and travel to the Chinatown-International District deserve to feel safe and be safe,\u201d said King County Prosecuting Attorney Leesa Manion after the judge found probable cause to hold him on five counts of first-degree assault.",
      "In setting the high bail amount, the judge noted that the man had a warrant out for his arrest. He also has nine felony convictions in Washington state that include four car thefts, possession of stolen property, robbery and attempted burglary, according to the probable cause report.",
      "The case is still under investigation and has not been referred to the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office for a charging decision, spokesperson Casey McNerthney said Saturday. They expect to receive the case by Thursday, he said.",
      "Messages sent to the King County Department of Public Defense seeking comment were not immediately returned Saturday afternoon.",
      "Four of the five victims were taken to Harborview Medical Center on Friday. One man who was in critical condition was upgraded to serious, while two others remain in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit, Susan Gregg, spokesperson for the hospital, said Saturday. Another male patient was in satisfactory condition, she said.",
      "Police said they recovered two knives soiled with what appeared to be blood in the parking lot where the man was arrested. A third knife was lodged in a victim's back when he was taken to the hospital, court records said.",
      "Seattle police said they believe the man was also involved in at least four other stabbings in the same area on Thursday. He fit the descriptions of the suspect and the attacks were also random, like Friday's assaults. Police continue to investigate the case and more charges may be added, they said.",
      "The Thursday stabbings in Chinatown started when a 52-year-old woman was found with multiple stab wounds, police said. On Thursday afternoon, a 32-year-old man was found after being stabbed multiple times and at about 8 p.m., a 37-year-old man was stabbed multiple times in the back, police said.",
      "On Friday at about 2 p.m., police received 911 reports that four people had been stabbed in Chinatown. Another victim was found about a block away, the probable cause statement said.",
      "One witness told police that he saw the suspect walk up behind a man and stab him in the back. That man was hospitalized with four stab wounds. The witness said he followed the suspect as he calmly walked up the street and then stabbed three people as they stood on a corner.",
      "Video evidence showed that the suspect also stabbed another man before striking the group of three, police said. The video shows the suspect walking behind a person and stabbing him in the back. He fell to the ground with the knife still lodged in his back, police said.",
      "Police arrived and used witness descriptions to take the man into custody. He was wearing a black sweatshirt with writing across the chest that read \u201cFear of God State,\u201d police said. He had what appeared to be blood on his hands and shoes, police said.",
      "\u201cThis incident was apparently one individual over a 38-hour period of time committing random assaults,\u201d Deputy Chief Eric Barden said at the scene Friday."

      "Donald Trump has ambitious Day 1 plans for when he moves back into the White House in January",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump has said he wouldn\u2019t be a dictator \u2014 \u201cexcept for Day 1.\" According to his own statements, he's got a lot to do on that first day in the White House.",
      "His list includes starting up the mass deportation of migrants, rolling back Biden administration policies on education, reshaping the federal government by firing potentially thousands of federal employees he believes are secretly working against him, and pardoning people who were arrested for their role in the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "\u201cI want to close the border, and I want to drill, drill, drill,\" he said of his Day 1 plans.",
      "When he took office in 2017, he had a long list, too, including immediately renegotiating trade deals, deporting migrants and putting in place measures to root out government corruption. Those things didn't happen all at once.",
      "How many executive orders in the first week? \u201cThere will be tens of them. I can assure you of that,\" Trump\u2019s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told Fox News on Sunday.",
      "Here's a look at what Trump has said he will do in his second term and whether he can do it the moment he steps into the White House:",
      "Trump has said that \u201cwithin two seconds\" of taking office that he would fire Jack Smith, the special counsel who has been prosecuting two federal cases against him. Smith is already evaluating how to wind down the cases because of long-standing Justice Department policy that says sitting presidents cannot be prosecuted.",
      "Smith charged Trump last year with plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.",
      "Trump cannot pardon himself when it comes to his state conviction in New York in a hush money case, but he could seek to leverage his status as president-elect in an effort to set aside or expunge his felony conviction and stave off a potential prison sentence.",
      "A case in Georgia, where Trump was charged with election interference, will likely be the only criminal case left standing. It would probably be put on hold until at least 2029, at the end of his presidential term. The Georgia prosecutor on the case just won reelection.",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged since a mob of Trump supporters spun up by the outgoing president attacked the Capitol almost nearly four years ago.",
      "Trump launched his general election campaign in March by not merely trying to rewrite the history of that riot, but positioning the violent siege and failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election as a cornerstone of his bid to return to the White House. As part of that, he called the rioters \u201cunbelievable patriots\u201d and promised to help them \u201cthe first day we get into office.\u201d",
      "As president, Trump can pardon anyone convicted in federal court, District of Columbia Superior Court or in a military court-martial. He can stop the continued prosecution of rioters by telling his attorney general to stand down.",
      "\u201cI am inclined to pardon many of them,\" Trump said on his social media platform in March when announcing the promise. \u201cI can\u2019t say for every single one, because a couple of them, probably they got out of control.\u201d",
      "Trump could begin the process of stripping tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections, so they could be more easily fired.",
      "He wants to do two things: drastically reduce the federal workforce, which he has long said is an unnecessary drain, and to \u201ctotally obliterate the deep state\u201d \u2014 perceived enemies who, he believes, are hiding in government jobs.",
      "Within the government, there are hundreds of politically appointed professionals who come and go with administrations. There also are tens of thousands of \u201ccareer\u201d officials, who work under Democratic and Republican presidents. They are considered apolitical workers whose expertise and experience help keep the government functioning, particularly through transitions.",
      "Trump wants the ability to convert some of those career people into political jobs, making them easier to dismiss and replace with loyalists. He would try to accomplish that by reviving a 2020 executive order known as \u201cSchedule F.\u201d The idea behind the order was to strip job protections from federal workers and create a new class of political employees. It could affect roughly 50,000 of 2.2 million civilian federal employees.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden rescinded the order when he took office in January 2021. But Congress failed to pass a bill protecting federal employees. The Office of Personnel Management, the federal government\u2019s chief human resources agency, finalized a rule last spring against reclassifying workers, so Trump might have to spend months \u2014 or even years \u2014 unwinding it.",
      "Trump has said he has a particular focus on \u201ccorrupt bureaucrats who have weaponized our justice system\u201d and \u201ccorrupt actors in our national security and intelligence apparatus.\u201d",
      "Beyond the firings, Trump wants to crack down on government officials who leak to reporters. He also wants to require that federal employees pass a new civil service test.",
      "Trump promised throughout the campaign to impose tariffs on imported goods, particularly those from China. He argued that such import taxes would keep manufacturing jobs in the United States, shrink the federal deficit and help lower food prices. He also cast them as central to his national security agenda.",
      "\u201cTariffs are the greatest thing ever invented,\" Trump said during a September rally in Flint, Michigan.",
      "The size of his pledged tariffs varied. He proposed at least a 10% across-the-board tariff on imported goods, a 60% import tax on goods from China and a 25% tariff on all goods from Mexico \u2014 if not more.",
      "Trump would likely not need Congress to impose these tariffs, as was clear in 2018, when he imposed them on steel and aluminum imports without going through lawmakers by citing Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. That law, according to the Congressional Research Service, gives a president the power to adjust tariffs on imports that could affect U.S. national security, an argument Trump has made.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re being invaded by Mexico,\u201d Trump said at a rally in North Carolina this month. Speaking about the new president of Mexico, Claudia Sheinbaum, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m going to inform her on Day 1 or sooner that if they don\u2019t stop this onslaught of criminals and drugs coming into our country, I\u2019m going to immediately impose a 25% tariff on everything they send into the United States of America.\u201d",
      "Trump said during the campaign that he would roll back Biden administration action seeking to protect transgender students from discrimination in schools on the first day of his new administration.",
      "Opposition to transgender rights was central to the Trump campaign\u2019s closing argument. His campaign ran an ad in the final days of the race against Vice President Kamala Harris in which a narrator said: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration announced new Title IX protections in April that made clear treating transgender students differently from their classmates is discrimination. Trump responded by saying he would roll back those changes, pledging to do some on the first day of his new administration and specifically noting he has the power to act without Congress.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end it on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in May. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, that was done as an order from the president. That came down as an executive order. And we\u2019re going to change it \u2014 on Day 1 it\u2019s going to be changed.\u201d",
      "It is unlikely Trump will stop there.",
      "Speaking at a Wisconsin rally in June, Trump said \u201con Day 1\" he would \u201csign a new executive order\u201d that would cut federal money for any school \u201cpushing critical race theory, transgender insanity and other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content onto the lives of our children.\u201d",
      "Trump hasn\u2019t said how he would try to cut schools\u2019 federal money, and any widespread rollback would require action from Congress.",
      "Trump is looking to reverse climate policies aimed at reducing planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "With an executive order on Day 1, he can roll back environmental protections, halt wind projects, scuttle the Biden administration's targets that encourage the switch to electric cars and abolish standards for companies to become more environmentally friendly.",
      "He has pledged to increase production of U.S. fossil fuels, promising to \u201cdrill, drill, drill,\" when he gets into office on Day 1 and seeking to open the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he claims would lower energy costs.",
      "Trump has repeatedly said he could settle the war between Russia and Ukraine in one day.",
      "When asked to respond to the claim, Russia\u2019s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said \u201cthe Ukrainian crisis cannot be solved in one day.\u201d",
      "Leavitt, the Trump press secretary, told Fox News after Trump on Wednesday was declared the winner of the election that he would now be able to \u201cnegotiate a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.\u201d She later said, \u201cIt includes, on Day 1, bringing Ukraine and Russia to the negotiating table to end this war.\u201d",
      "Russia invaded Ukraine nearly three years ago. Trump, who makes no secret of his admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, has criticized the Biden administration for giving money to Ukraine to fight the war.",
      "At a CNN town hall in May 2023, Trump said: \u201cThey\u2019re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I\u2019ll have that done \u2014 I\u2019ll have that done in 24 hours.\u201d He said that would happen after he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Putin.",
      "Speaking last month at his Madison Square Garden rally in New York, Trump said: \u201cOn Day 1, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out. I will rescue every city and town that has been invaded and conquered, and we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail, then kick them the hell out of our country as fast as possible.\u201d",
      "Trump can direct his administration to begin the effort the minute he arrives in office, but it's much more complicated to actually deport the nearly 11 million people who are believed to be in the United States illegally. That would require a huge, trained law enforcement force, massive detention facilities, airplanes to move people and nations willing to accept them.",
      "Trump has said he would invoke the Alien Enemies Act. That rarely used 1798 law allows the president to deport anyone who is not an American citizen and is from a country with which there is a \u201cdeclared war\u201d or a threatened or attempted \u201cinvasion or predatory incursion.\u201d",
      "He has spoken about deploying the National Guard, which can be activated on orders from a governor. Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser, said sympathetic Republican governors could send troops to nearby states that refuse to participate.",
      "Asked about the cost of his plan, he told NBC News: \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not \u2014 really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they\u2019re going to go back to those countries because they\u2019re not staying here. There is no price tag.\u201d",

      "Firefighters continued making progress against a wildfire northwest of Los Angeles in Ventura County that broke out Wednesday and quickly exploded in size due to dry, warm and gusty Santa Ana winds.",
      "The Mountain Fire prompted thousands of residents to flee their homes and was 26% contained as of Sunday, up from 21% the previous day. The fire\u2019s size remains around 32 square miles (about 83 square kilometers). The cause is under investigation.",
      "\u201cThe fire continues to creep and smolder in steep rugged terrain. Threats remain to critical infrastructure, highways, and communities,\u201d according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, better known as Cal Fire.",
      "Meanwhile, New York State Police said they were investigating the death of Dariel Vasquez, an 18-year-old state parks employee who died when a tree fell on him Saturday afternoon as he battled a major brush fire in Sterling Forest, located in New York state's Greenwood Lake near the New Jersey line.",
      "\u201cRip brother your shift is over job well done,\u201d a New York State forestry services post said.",

      "Health advisories were issued for parts of New York, including New York City, and northeastern New Jersey due to unhealthy air quality due to smoke from the fires.

      "Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Opponents of offshore wind energy projects expect President-elect Donald Trump to kill an industry he has vowed to end on the first day he returns to the White House.",
      "But it might not be that easy.",
      "Many of the largest offshore wind companies put a brave face on the election results, pledging to work with Trump and Congress to build power projects and ignoring the incoming president's oft-stated hostility to them.",
      "In campaign appearances, Trump railed against offshore wind and promised to sign an executive order to block such projects.",
      "\u201cWe are going to make sure that that ends on Day 1,\u201d Trump said in a May speech. \u201cI\u2019m going to write it out in an executive order. It\u2019s going to end on Day 1.\"",
      "\u201cThey destroy everything, they\u2019re horrible, the most expensive energy there is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey ruin the environment, they kill the birds, they kill the whales.\u201d",
      "Numerous federal and state scientific agencies say there is no evidence linking offshore wind preparation to a spate of whale deaths along the U.S. East Coast in recent years. Turbines have been known to kill shorebirds, but the industry and regulators say there are policies to mitigate harm to the environment.",
      "Trump has railed against offshore wind turbines spoiling the view from a golf course he owns in Scotland. But numerous environmental groups say the real reason he opposes offshore wind is his support for the fossil fuel industry.",
      "There is almost 65 gigawatts of offshore wind capacity under development in the U.S., enough to power more than 26 million homes, and some turbines are already spinning in several states, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Currently operating projects include the Block Island Wind Farm in Rhode Island, the Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind pilot project and the South Fork Wind Farm about 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Montauk Point on New York\u2019s Long Island.",
      "Trump is unlikely to end those projects but might have more leverage over ones still in the planning stage, those in the debate say.",
      "Bob Stern, who headed an office in the U.S. Energy Department responsible for environmental protection during the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations, said Trump can get Congress to reduce or eliminate tax credits for offshore wind that were granted in the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act. Those credits are an integral part of the finances of many offshore wind projects.",
      "Stern, who leads the New Jersey anti-offshore wind group Save LBI, said Trump also could issue executive orders prohibiting further offshore leases and rescinding approval for ones already approved while pushing Congress to amend federal laws granting more protection for marine mammals.",
      "The president-elect also can appoint leaders of agencies involved in offshore wind regulation who would be hostile to it or less supportive.",
      "Opponents of offshore wind, many of them Republicans, were giddy following the election, saying they fully expect Trump to put an end to the industry.",
      "\u201cI believe this is a tipping point for the offshore wind industry in America,\u201d said Robin Shaffer, president of Protect Our Coast NJ, one of the most vocal groups opposing offshore wind on the East Coast. \"They have been given a glidepath by Democrat-run administrations at the federal and state level for many years. For this industry, (Tuesday's) results will bring headwinds far greater than they have faced previously.\"",
      "But Tina Zappile, director of the Hughes Center for Public Policy at New Jersey's Stockton University, noted that in 2018, Trump Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke voiced strong support for offshore wind. And even though the president-elect has bashed the technology, she predicted he won't just make it go away.",
      "\u201cOffshore wind might appear to be on the chopping block \u2014 Trump\u2019s explicitly said this was something he\u2019d fix on the first day \u2014 but when the economics of offshore wind are in alignment with his overall strategies of returning manufacturing to America and becoming energy-independent, his administration is likely to back away slowly from this claim,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cOffshore wind may be temporarily hampered, but its long-term prospects in the U.S. are unlikely to be hurt.\u201d",
      "Commercial fishermen in Maine said they hope the Trump administration will undo policies designed to help build and approve offshore wind projects, saying regulators attempted to \u201cfuture-proof\u201d the industry against political change. Jerry Leeman, CEO of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association, called on Trump to reverse a commitment to deploy 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.",
      "The offshore wind industry is taking an optimistic stance, pledging to work with Trump his political allies. National and New Jersey wind industry groups, and several offshore wind developers including Atlantic Shores and Denmark-based Orsted, issued similarly worded statements highlighting terms likely to appeal to Republicans including job creation, economic development and national security.",
      "\u201cBy combining the strengths of all domestic energy resources, the Trump administration can advance an economy that is dynamic, secure, and clean,\u201d Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. \"We are committed to working with the Trump-Vance administration and the new Congress to continue this great American success story.\u201d",
      "But few Republicans were in a welcoming mood following the election. New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra listed the major offshore wind companies in a Facebook post, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to pack your bags and get the hell away from the Jersey Shore, our marine life, fishing industry and beautiful beaches.\u201d",
      "Kanitra said he was looking forward \u201cto your stock prices tanking.\u201d And that was starting to happen.",
      "The stock prices of European offshore wind companies, many of which are planning or building projects on the U.S. East Coast, plunged amid fears the new administration would seek to slow or end such projects. Orsted closed down nearly 14% on Wednesday and was down 11% over the past five days. Turbine manufacturer Vestas Wind Systems was down nearly 24% over that same period.",
      "Rep. Jeff Van Drew, a New Jersey Republican, hosted Trump at a rally earlier this year at which Trump again vowed to kill offshore wind.",
      "\u201cWe are currently working out the specifics of what that will look like once he takes office again this January,\" VanDrew said. \u201cPresident Trump is a good friend of New Jersey, and he understands the devastating impact these projects will have on our communities.\u201d",

      "FORT JACKSON, S.C. -- Index cards taped to a large board on the wall at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, reveal the sometimes blunt and gritty reasons that new recruits took a chance at a last-ditch program to get into the Army.",
      "\u201cEviction notices motivate me,\u201d one said. Others talked about getting free college, a good job and a way to better themselves.",
      "Known as the \u201cWhy Wall,\u201d the board is meant as an inspiration for the recruits who could not meet the Army's physical and academic test standards, so they went into the Future Soldier Prep Course. It provides weeks of instruction to help them bring up their scores.",
      "Started as a trial program two years ago to help boost dismal recruiting numbers, the prep course is fueling the Army\u2019s enlistment comeback. Recruiting has suffered for all the military branches in recent years coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, amid low unemployment and stiff competition from private companies able to pay more and provide similar or better benefits.",
      "By the end of this budget year on Sept. 30, the Army had made its recruiting goal of 55,000, and service leaders said more than 13,000 of those recruits \u2014 or 24% \u2014 came into active duty through the prep course.",
      "Army leaders increased the goal to 61,000 for this year and are relying on the prep course to provide a significant chunk again.",
      "During a recent visit to Fort Jackson, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth spoke with recruits and program leaders to see how the course is going and what changes may need to be made. She said the successful program, which more than 31,000 trainees have gone through since it started, deserves to be made permanent.",
      "Wormuth said the Army may make adjustments based on a long-term study on the recruits coming out of the course, including looking at how well they did in their first enlistment and whether there were behavioral or disciplinary problems.",
      "\"We really want to see what kind of soldier kind of comes out at the back end of that first term, how do they do in terms of discipline,\" Wormuth said.",
      "Drill sergeants have expressed concerns that they are seeing more discipline issues, disrespect and complaints from trainees in the academic course. And they say trainees whose first language is not English have a more difficult time understanding orders and dealing with computers.",
      "While they see fewer discipline issues from recruits in the fitness section, they do see more injuries, including ankle, knee and hip problems. Those trainees, they say, may need to be brought along even more slowly, to increase their strength and conditioning, rather than moving them to basic training the minute they hit the minimum level of requirements.",
      "Commanders told Wormuth that the fitness program aims to give trainees a healthy foundation in eating and working out. Instructors said they do not want to break the recruits before they get to basic training, so they do a lot of yoga, stretching and other exercises to help avoid injuries.",
      "In the classrooms, they are learning basic math, English and other academic skills. The bulk of recruits going through the program are in the academic course.",
      "So far, Wormuth said, the data does not reflect some of the concerns expressed by drill sergeants and commanders. Instead, she and other Army leaders said that on average, the graduation rate from basic training is a bit higher \u2014 about 94% \u2014 for those who went through the program versus those who did not, which is about 92%.",
      "But so far, they are taking inspiration from the thoughts scrawled on the \u201cWhy Wall.\"",
      "Company commanders came up with the idea last year, to let recruits lay out their goals in their first few days so they can go back every week to get motivated or see their progress.",
      "A bright yellow sign atop the board tells recruits: \u201cYour WHY will keep you going even when you want to QUIT the most.\u201d The answer for many was they had something to prove \u2014 to themselves and others.",
      "\u201cI joined the Army because my family thought I couldn\u2019t accomplish anything in life. So I had to prove them wrong,\u201d one said. Another wrote: \u201cI wanna show my family I\u2019m worth something.\u201d",
      "Others said they wanted to \u201cbe a better man,\u201d \u201cgain my independence\u201d and \u201cprove to myself that I can accomplish something and I'm not a quitter.\u201d",
      "One recruit was blunt: \"To prove to her I\u2019m not gonna turn into who she said I\u2019d become.\u201d",
      "Recruits lined up near the wall told Wormuth that the physical fitness program is working for them.",
      "Couper Godleski, from Pennsylvania, said that in 10 weeks he had lost 20 pounds.",
      "Britney Vaughn, from Louisiana, said she had lost 30 pounds in six weeks. And while she said she is missing her 3-year-old daughter, \u201cI feel like everything will be worth it.\u201d",
      "On the academic side, recruits told Wormuth that even as they struggle with math or English comprehension, they are getting help from instructors while learning the structure and discipline of the Army. A key goal, said one female recruit, is \u201cto be a role model to my nieces and nephews\u201d and get money for college so she doesn't have to be in debt.",
      "For Wormuth, the visit confirmed Army leaders' intention to keep the program going.",
      "Recruiting challenges are not going to end, she said.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to probably continue to see pretty low unemployment. We\u2019re still going to see 60% go to college. It\u2019s a more competitive labor market,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to have to keep fighting hard for our new recruits.\u201d"

      "The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Jaquez Myrick, 25, of Montgomery, was taken into custody while leaving the scene of the campus shooting and had been found with a handgun with a machine gun conversion device. The agency said in a statement that Myrick faces a federal charge of possession of a machine gun. It did not accuse him of using the gun in the shooting or provide additional details.",
      "The agency did not say whether Myrick was a student at the historically Black university where the shooting erupted as the school's 100th Homecoming Week was winding down. Authorities said an 18-year-old man who died was not a university student but that some of the injured were students.",

    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",

      "But are these products, which can cost hundreds of pounds, actually worth the money?",
      "Yes, says TikToker Cissy Jones from Manchester.",
      "We\u2019re just over a week into November and the 27-year-old, who is a social media manager at fashion brand PrettyLittleThing but also makes TikToks on her personal account, has already posted a dozen advent calendar videos. Everything from chocolate, to beauty products and wine, and even a Pets At Home calendar for her dog.",
      "\"There\u2019s one - the Harrods 12-day one \u2013 where every product in it is something that I would buy,\" she says. \"So I\u2019m saving money.\"",
      "That idea of saving money is something that brands latch on to with their marketing. A calendar may cost \u00a3250 but it\u2019s actually \"worth \u00a31,000\", they say, if you add up all the individual items.",
      "\"But you do have to want the actual products,\" says Cissy. \"Otherwise, it\u2019s a bit of a waste of money.\"",
      "Retailers can afford to make such seemingly good offers because there\u2019s a lot of margin built into beauty products, analysts say.",
      "And rather than aiming to make a big profit on them, they view advent calendars as a marketing tool to get you to buy more products afterwards.",
      "\"A lot of retailers recognise advent calendars are a great way of getting new products to the consumer and a way to get them to convert,\" says Natalie Berg from NBK Retail.",
      "However, Sarah Johnson from Flourish Retail says that while there are many lovely bespoke calendars out there, \"a lot [of companies] just use advent calendars to shift stock that may not be popular, rather than having to discount it\".",
      "Shoppers warned over luxury advent calendar scams",
      "The size of the items in advent calendars can vary \u2013 with some offering full-sized bottles, some smaller versions, and some a mix of the two.",
      "But smaller sizes may be what people want, says Ms Berg, as it's common to want to try something out before fully committing.",
      "Holly May Arnott agrees. \"They\u2019re a fantastic way to try new and trending products that I might have seen previously on social media,\" she says.",
      "The 26-year-old has been buying beauty calendars for several years now. It's something she and her mum do together.",
      "\"It\u2019s like prolonging that Christmas morning thrill,\" she says, adding a sense of excitement throughout December.",
      "The most expensive one she's bought was from Selfridges, which was \"such a luxury\".",
      "But she says while beauty calendars \"can feel like a bit of an investment, they\u2019re worth it for us\".",
      "With so many products out there, Cissy Jones\u2019s advice is to look for a brand you like and to look for value for money, in terms of the total cost of all the items individually versus the price of the calendar.",
      "However, even if a product may seem like good value for money, for some, spending more than \u00a3200 on an advent calendar is simply a luxury they cannot afford.",
      "As a result, many scam websites have sprung up, trying to take advantage of people looking for a good deal on an expensive item.",
      "Emma Jones and Nihal, who did not want us to use her last name, got in touch with the BBC after falling for fake adverts claiming to sell the Space NK \u00a3250 advent calendar for \u00a328.99. Both women were attracted by the apparent discount, and say they would not pay full price.",

      "But part of the reason beauty advent calendars are so popular is because shoppers still want to treat themselves, says Natalie Berg.",
      "And many are willing to pay full price \u2013 and beyond.",
      "The likes of Space NK, Harrods and Sephora have all sold out of their main calendars already.",
      "The Harrods beauty calendar was priced at \u00a3250 but claimed to include items worth \u00a31,600, while Sephora\u2019s \u00a3199 calendar said it included items worth \u00a31,000.",
      "But you can find people selling them on eBay, asking for as much as \u00a3550 for the Harrods one and \u00a3399 for the Sephora one.",
      "\"It goes back to supply and demand - dynamic pricing,\" says Sarah Johnson.",
      "It might make sense to buy it even at an overinflated price, she says, if the retailer is sold out and you can\u2019t get it anywhere else, especially if you perceive it as still making a saving on the total value of all the items.",
      "This begs the question though of why firms don't just make more.",
      "Ms Johnson points out that it's a seasonal product and they don't want to over-order and be left with surplus stock that they would then have to discount.",
      "Space NK told the BBC that it produced 30% more stock this year than last year but due to \"unprecedented\" demand still sold out within two and a half weeks. It plans to increase production next year.",
      "Despite the expensive nature of beauty calendars, Ms Johnson says there is a \"value perception\" there.",
      "\"People could buy it to break it out and give [individual items] as gifts. There\u2019s an element of people treating themselves and also being quite savvy and saving themselves money in the long run.\"",
      "With more and more of these calendars on sale now, there was a thought a few years ago that we might have reached \"peak\" advent calendar.",
      "But Cissy Jones disagrees \u2013 and thinks the opposite is the case.",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",

      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "The Treasury should have disclosed a \u00a39.5bn overspend in the public finances in the run-up to the previous government's Spring Budget \"under the law\", the UK's budget watchdog has said.",
      "Richard Hughes, chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), told a committee of MPs on Tuesday the Treasury should explain why information was \"not provided to us\".",
      "His comments prompted the committee's chair and Labour MP Meg Hillier to suggest the Treasury \"may have broken the law\".",

      "The \u00a39.5bn overspend forms the basis of Chancellor Rachel Reeves\u2019 claim that the Conservatives left Labour with a significant \"hole\" in the public finances.",
      "Asked by the committee on Tuesday how the shortfall could have happened, the OBR's Mr Hughes said \"the system very clearly broke down\", but insisted \"that kind of failure will not happen again\" because of processes put in place since.",
      "The OBR works closely with the Treasury. Its role is to assess the government's tax and spending plans and produce reports on whether the chancellors' plans are sound.",
      "Its judgements and forecasts are closely watched by financial markets to determine if the UK's economic plans are credible.",
      "Pushed on whether the Treasury broke the law over not disclosing an overspend, Mr Hughes said there may \"have been a misunderstanding of how the law ought to be interpreted\".",
      "\"There is no doubt in our minds that had that information been provided we would have had a materially different judgement,\" he added.",
      "He said it \"was a question for the Treasury to ask: why was information available within the Treasury and not provided to us?\"",
      "In summarising Mr Hughes' comments, Hillier said: \"The Treasury may have even broken the law in the run-up to the Spring Budget in not disclosing all the spending information.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Hunt has previously accused the OBR of failing to act in a \"politically impartial manner\" by releasing its findings about the overspend on the day of the Budget last week, arguing it would help make the case for Labour's big tax rises.",
      "Hunt said it was \"impossible to know\" how much of the \u00a39.5bn would have been compensated for by savings elsewhere.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC: \u201cAt the time of the Spring Budget, we communicated to the OBR the decision that ministers would manage spending pressures by making offsetting savings. This was within the law.",
      "\"We have accepted all the recommendations put forward by the OBR in its review of the March 2024 forecast.",

      "At the Budget, Reeves said employers will pay NI at a rate of 15% on salaries above \u00a35,000 from April, up from 13.8% on salaries above \u00a39,100.",
      "The OBR has calculated that three quarters of the impact would be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "The watchdog's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "Prof Miles said the OBR estimated employers would only take around a quarter of the hit from the NI changes in terms of lower profits, and suggested that the rest would be felt by workers.",
      "He said part of the reason for this was the reduction of the threshold for employers paying the tax.",

      "'Just pay up,' says Post Office scandal victim",
      "'The Post Office has ruined every happy moment of my life since 2005'",
      "At the committee, lawyers were asked about their experience of the Horizon Shortfall compensation scheme, which is overseen by the Post Office.",
      "This compensation scheme is for sub-postmasters who were not convicted, or part of the Group Litigation Order (GLO) court action, but who believe they experienced shortfalls because of Horizon.",
      "David Enright, whose law firm represents hundreds of Post Office victims, said there is no funding for legal advice at the start, with claimants presented with a \"DIY questionnaire\".",

    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed.

      "The Eastern European country of Moldova is continuing efforts to attract overseas firms, as it tries to move past political uncertainty.",
      "\"I went with a backpack, and set up a business,\" says Dutch entrepreneur Luc Vocks, recalling how he moved to Moldova in 2007.",
      "Mr Vocks had first visited the former Soviet republic three years earlier, and recalls experiencing \"the clich\u00e9 that one would have of Eastern Europe at that time\".",
      "\"Everything was dirt cheap, and if you were a foreigner you'd get attention,\" he says.",
      "Today, Mr Vocks is the owner of a Moldovan company called DevelopmentAid. Based in the capital Chisinau, it employs 180 people in the country, and runs a website that lists job vacancies in the international development community.",
      "Mr Vocks is one of a growing number of foreign entrepreneurs in Moldova. The government wants to attract more like him and hopes that low business tax rates will help.",
      "The country's standard corporation tax rate - the amount that firms have to pay on their profits - is just 12%. This compares with 25% in the UK, and 25.8% in the Netherlands where Mr Vocks had initially launched his company before relocating it to Moldova.",
      "There's an even better deal for tech firms. In 2018 the Moldovan government launched an initiative to grow the country's IT sector - the Moldova IT Park (MITP).",
      "This isn't a physical business park. Instead it is virtual scheme open to all IT firms in the country - and those that wish to move there from overseas. Firms that sign up only have to pay a corporation tax rate of 7%.",
      "The MITP is part of a wider effort by the Moldovan government to modernise and expand its economy ahead of a bid to join the European Union in 2030.",
      "This drive is being led by Moldova's pro-EU President Maia Sandu, who this week was re-elected for a second term. And last month Moldovans voted \"yes\" on pro-EU constitutional changes.",
      "However, the vote was extremely close, with Yes getting 50.46% and No receiving 49.54%. Although Russia denied interfering in the vote, Moldova\u2019s authorities said attempts had been made to buy up to 300,000 votes in what Maia Sandu described as an \"unprecedented assault on freedom and democracy\".",
      "Moscow is opposed to Moldova joining the EU, and supports Moldova's breakaway region of Transnistria economically, politically and militarily.",
      "Dumitru Alaiba, Moldova's deputy prime minister and minister for economic development and digitalisation, is positive about where Moldova is heading.",
      "\"Moldova in the past 10 to 15 years has really proven that it's a country that can change very fast,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "\"This used to be a highly corrupt country, a country where, exactly 10 years ago, a billion dollars from our central banks just disappeared.\"",
      "\"We are moving very fast towards joining the EU, and we are reforming our economy at top speed. Of course, we have a long way to go.\"",
      "He pointed to Moldova's rise on the global Corruption Perceptions Index, produced by anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International.",
      "Out of 180 countries - with a lower placing meaning that a country is less corrupt - Moldova is now in 76th place, up from 91st a year earlier.",
      "\"Now entrepreneurs can breathe freely without fear of repercussion, without fear of corrupt inspectors, without fear of a filthy justice sector that commits crazy abuses.\"",
      "Mr Vocks agrees that Moldova is now a much easier place in which to do business than when he first set up his company there back in 2007.",
      "\"Back then, it was extremely bureaucratic. It was hard to get a residence permit. It was painful to register a company, especially as a foreigner.",
      "\"It was painful intersecting with the tax agency. The banks were rough to work with.\"",
      "Member companies of the MITP don't just benefit from the 7% corporation tax rate. They also don't need to make employer social security contributions, and staff don't have to pay income tax. Mr Volks signed up DevelopmentAid almost immediately.",
      "The MITP has also simplified immigration procedures through the IT Visa program.",
      "More than 2,000 companies are now registered with the MITP, 300 of which have come from overseas. The most common countries these have moved from being the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, and Ukraine.",
      "In the first half of 2024, MITP firms generated a combined \u20ac365m ($397m; \u00a3308m) in revenues, according to official figures. And now employing 22,000 people in general, they are said to contribute around 6% of the country's GDP.",
      "While the MITP scheme has worked to boost Moldova's IT sector, the influx of foreign tech companies has driven up salaries in the industry considerably.",
      "Sven Wiese, a German expat who has set up a small IT services business in the country called Trabia, says he is now finding himself priced out when it comes to employee pay.",
      "He says that the biggest firms signed up to the MITP can offer IT specialists more than \u20ac100,000 a year, \"because that is still cheaper than hiring people within a bigger country like the US or Germany\".",
      "At the same time he says that many Moldovan IT sector workers still want to leave the country. \"Fewer people are now leaving Moldova, but emigration is still high.\"",
      "Another negative issue is the continuing war in neighbouring Ukraine, which is likely making some Western IT firms think twice about investing in Moldova. Mr Alaiba says is confident that Moldova is safe \"as long as the free world is supporting Ukraine\".",
      "Marina Bzovii, MITP's administrator and an assistant professor at the Technical University of Moldova, already sees Moldova as a regional business hub. \"Moldova is connecting even Central Asia, countries like Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, who are culturally much further from Europe.",

      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 12:06:41 GMT",
    "summary": "New figures show university graduates could be eligible for refunds worth nearly \u00a3200m.",
    "story": [
      "University graduates across the UK are being urged by a campaign group to check whether they are due a refund on their student loan repayment after it was revealed that nearly \u00a3200m was overpaid last year.",
      "Save the Student's comments come after figures were published which show that hundreds of thousands of people currently paying off their loans are eligible for a share of \u00a3184m in refunds.",
      "It is easy to check whether a refund is owed by logging on to the government's Student Loan Company portal, where individual refunds could range from tens of pounds to more than \u00a31,000.",
      "Tom Allingham from Save the Student said for many getting a refund could make a world of difference.",
      "Charlotte Gill is one such former student who was eligible for a refund on her loan payments, to the tune of \u00a368.",
      "She said it did not make a huge difference \"but every little helps when you are a student\".",
      "\"At the end of the day, it's your money, it\u2019s not the government's money, so if you've got any entitlement to a refund then absolutely take it,\" she said.",
      "Martin De'Ath received \u00a3396 in his refund and says the substantial payment made him question how he could have used it in the 10 months he was without it.",
      "\"I was definitely pleased to get it back at least,\" he said.",
      "There are four reasons people may be eligible for refunds.",
      "The main reason, behind \u00a3146m of the total, is that repayments were taken from people despite them not earning above the annual threshold at which point repayments automatically kick in.",
      "This can happen when someone earns above the monthly threshold which triggers the beginning of loan repayments, due to things like to taking extra shifts, getting a new job or receiving a bonus, but their annual earnings might still fall below the yearly threshold.",
      "Since May, those who fall into this category have been able to use a new service offered by the SLC to request refunds online. In the first six months of the service, 418,000 people have done so.",
      "Other reasons may be that former students are charged repayments before they are required to pay, which is generally in the April after they finish studying.",
      "Some people may have been put on the wrong payment plans by their employer, while others may have continued making payments after their loan had been paid off in full.",
      "Any money overpaid does count towards the full repayment of the loan, and may save graduates money in the long run on interest.",
      "However, as Mr Allingham said, many university graduates may need the cash for their day-to-day expenses.",
      "\"It is definitely worth doing, particularly even with the cost of living crisis still lingering on a little bit, having that extra boost of cash right now could make a world of difference,\" Mr Allingham said.",
      "Everything you need to know about student loans",

    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",
      "\u201cJiang Ping is not innocent, that\u2019s without question. But who are the worst parties in this?\u201d reads a post on Weibo. \u201cThe adults brought this child along to do a bad deed, and let her suffer all the consequences.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven if the whole thing was faked, Jiang Ping was not the mastermind behind it,\u201d another wrote on Weibo. \u201cShe should not be burned at the stake.\u201d",

      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",

      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

      "Given the stress it has caused him, I ask what changed his mind.",

      "\u201cEven though the first series was such a huge global success, honestly I didn\u2019t make much,\u201d he tells me. \u201cSo doing the second series will help compensate me for the success of the first one too.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I didn\u2019t fully finish the story,\u201d he adds.",
      "The first series was Netflix\u2019s most successful show to date, thrusting South Korea and its home-grown television dramas into the spotlight. Its dark commentary on wealth inequality touched a nerve with audiences around the globe.",
      "But having killed off almost every character, Hwang has had to start from scratch, with a new cast and set of games, and this time audience expectations are sky high.",
      "\u201cThe stress I feel now is much greater,\u201d he says.",
      "Three years after the first series aired, Hwang is even more pessimistic about the state of the world.",
      "He points to current wars, climate change and a widening global wealth gap. Conflicts are no longer confined between the rich and poor, they are playing out intensely between different generations, genders and political camps, he says.",
      "\u201cNew lines are being drawn. We\u2019re in an era of us vs them. Who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong?\u201d",

      "In this series, the previous winner, Gi-hun, re-enters the game on a quest to bring it down and save the latest round of contestants.",

      "This, I am told, will lead to more factionalism and fights.",
      "It is part of director Hwang\u2019s plan to expose the dangers of living in an increasingly tribal world. Forcing people to pick sides, he believes, is fuelling conflict.",
      "For all those who were captivated by the shocking storytelling of Squid Game, there were others who found it gratuitously violent and difficult to watch.",
      "But it is clear from talking to Hwang, that the violence is fully thought out. He is a man who thinks and cares deeply about the world and is motivated by a mounting unease.",
      "\u201cWhen making this series, I constantly asked myself \u2018do we humans have what it takes to steer the world off this downhill path?\u2019. Honestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says.",
      "While viewers of the second series might not get the answers to these big life questions, they can at least be comforted that some plot holes will be filled in \u2013 like why the game exists, and what is motivating the masked Front Man running it.",

      "As one of South Korea\u2019s most famous actors, Lee admits that having his face and eyes covered and his voice distorted throughout the first series, was \u201ca little bit dissatisfying\u201d.",
      "This series he has relished having scenes without a mask, in which he can fully express himself \u2013 a chance he nearly did not get.",
      "Hwang tried for 10 years to get Squid Game made, taking out large loans to support his family, before Netflix swooped in.",
      "They paid him a modest upfront amount, leaving him unable to cash in on the whopping \u00a3650m it is estimated to have made the platform.",

      "The third instalment in the Paddington live action adventure franchise sees the marmalade sandwich munching bear return to Peru to visit his aunt Lucy.",
      "The film, that includes a return of much loved cast members including Ben Whishaw, Emily Mortimer and Hugh Bonneville, opened in UK cinemas on Friday 8 November.",
      "Since the beginning of the film series in 2014, Paddington Bear has grown to become a national treasure with fans of all ages through its heart-warming appeal.",
      "Of the latest film, Peter Bradshaw wrote in the Guardian that the experience was \"just as jolly as the previous two films, but not really as funny\" and likened it to a \"special episode of a TV sitcom that takes the cast to the Costa del Sol\".",
      "In the Hollywood Reporter, Leslie Felperin wrote that while the film \"lacks the absurdist wit and decidedly dark edge that elevated the first two Paddington movies\", it was \"serviceable enough given its limitations\".",

      "He added the pacing felt \"ponderous and slow\".",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey was one of many critics to give Paddington in Peru a three-star rating, praising the addition of new characters portrayed by Hollywood heavyweights Olivia Colman and Antonio Banderas, calling them \"assets\" to the film, albeit not matching the previous \"scene-stealing\" from Hugh Grant.",
      "Nick de Semlyen also agreed, writing in Empire: \"Colman is perfect casting as sinister sister Reverend Mother, overseer of the Home For Retired Bears.",

Antonio Banderas, meanwhile, goes full Kind Hearts And Coronets, playing not just a boat captain with a secret, but his many descendants.\"",
      "Speaking in an interview with BBC Radio 1, Whishaw, who has voiced the character of Paddington in all three movies, said \"I think they are beautiful films made with such care and love.",
      "\"A good film is a good film and they are hard to make, so I feel very proud of them and very proud to be associated in this way with this character.\"",
      "The director of the first two Paddington films, Paul King, has since moved on to new projects including Wonka, starring Timothee Chalamet, but he is credited with writing this latest story alongside Simon Farnaby and Mark Burton.",
      "Clarisse Loughrey gave the film three stars in the Independent, calling Paddington in Peru \"the worst in the franchise\" but praised the production design, which takes full advantage of moving the cast away from the cosy comforts of London, and making \"every interior look like an untouched escape room with secrets hidden under every trinket\".",
      "Leila Latif of Total Film gave Paddington in Peru four stars, saying \"despite the title, the film feels distinctly un-Peruvian\".",
      "She added: \"There are no Peruvian characters (unless you count the bears) and while the film alludes to the previous horrors of plundering Spanish colonizers in a surprisingly brutal montage, it's still an uneasy shift that there is more screen presence from people of colour in London than there is in South America.\"",

    "summary": "India\u2019s ban on the import of Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses is under scrutiny - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't know yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

      "My name is Alex. But increasingly young people shout \u201cTimmy\u201d at me in the street. This isn\u2019t mistaken identity - it\u2018s mockery because I use a wheelchair.",
      "I should ignore it, but this time, I react. I turn to see a group of young teenage boys smirking in front of me. \u201cI heard you,\u201d I tell them. \u201cI know exactly who Timmy is.\u201d",
      "I know this because although we do not share a name, I have felt the shadow of Timmy since childhood - never through choice.",

      "Growing up at the show\u2019s initial peak during the turn of the millennium, Timmy followed me through school corridors, classrooms and playgrounds - no matter my friends, sociability or relatively good grades.",
      "Now, in my 30s, he\u2019s back. For the third time in a year, this time heading to my local train station in my wheelchair, I hear the familiar, brutish drawl: \u201cTimmaaah.\u201d",
      "A laugh. A snigger. An assumption I either won\u2019t hear or be unable to understand.",

      "\u201cYou weren\u2019t,\u201d I say. \u201cI was watching the show before you were born.\u201d",
      "Initially I was baffled as to how this phenomenon had returned to a new young generation, 24 years after the character first appeared.",
      "The answer lies in social media, particularly TikTok, where hundreds of short user-edited clips of Timmy and audio of him saying his name are sparking the revival.",
      "TikTok users often take part in trends by using the audio of popular videos and overlaying it with their own clips.",
      "That\u2019s what many have done with Timmy, where the name is used as a punchline, or played on top of unrelated clips of wheelchair users, reinforcing harmful and dehumanising stereotypes.",
      "The irony is that the character Timmy is presented with warmth in South Park and given character depth by co-creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker.",
      "An equal in the show\u2019s unflinching satire, his disability isn\u2019t necessarily the butt of the joke.",
      "Timmy is an accepted member of the class: he fails to complete homework, faces adversity and causes trouble with his disabled best friend Jimmy. His personality is conveyed through the different intonations in which he delivers his name.",
      "One episode, Timmy 2000, sees him win a battle of the bands as frontman for a metal group. The adult characters are shown to respond in an over-protective and condescending way - a striking criticism of the way society often treats disabled people.",
      "Nearly 20 years ago, a poll by Ouch! - the former name of the BBC\u2019s disability section - crowned Timmy as the most popular disabled TV character.",
      "Seattle Times\u2019 late disabled critic Jeff Shannon described Timmy as the most \u201cprogressive, provocative and socially relevant disability humour ever presented on American television\u201d.",
      "\u201cWithout telling viewers what to think, South Park challenges [the audience\u2019s] own fears and foibles regarding disability, and Timmy emerges triumphant,\u201d he wrote in 2005.",
      "In interviews Stone and Parker have spoken of how carefully and purposefully they integrated him into the show.",
      "But two decades later, the fact remains that on meeting Timmy, certainly at first glance, many find him outrageously offensive.",

      "Soap star condemns 'daily abuse and prejudice'",
      "Heartstopper: 'How Netflix show's eating disorder story helps me'",
      "South Park has always worked on multiple levels - offering outrageous forbidden shock value for schoolchildren while delivering crunching adult satire.",
      "None of this nuance is reflected in the TikTok trend, which reduces Timmy, and by extension wheelchair users and disability, to one-dimensional ridicule.",
      "This warped revival parallels the case of Joey Deacon, a man with cerebral palsy whose appearance on Blue Peter in the 1980s backfired to spark playground mockery, with kids shouting \u201cyou're a Joey!\u201d, and \u201cdo the Joey face\u201d.",
      "TikTok says its community guidelines strictly prohibit hate speech and content promoting discrimination, violence or harm based on disability.",

      "Even if a video with an \u201coriginal sound\u201d is removed by the platform, the audio usually isn\u2019t, he says.",
      "This makes it a common way of bypassing TikTok\u2019s content moderation guidelines - including for harassment and abuse.",
      "Bullying and trolling of disabled people is still common online. Three in 10 said they\u2019d experienced it in a survey of 4,000 disabled people carried out by charity Scope.",
      "My last experience of having the name hurled at me on the street shocked me not so much in the name-calling, but the absolute lack of contrition shown even when challenged.",
      "It mirrored an experience last year when teenagers, again taunting me, rode off shouting \u201cTimmy is going to run us over.\u201d",
      "Ross Hovey, a wheelchair user and Liverpool fan, recently posted on LinkedIn about a near-identical experience.",
      "He was heading to a Liverpool match with his 79-year-old father and care assistant when a group of young men shouted \"Timmy\" at him. When Ross challenged them with \u201cI heard you,\u201d they too tried to claim innocence.",
      "The abuse raises questions about what role platforms should take in providing context to young users.",
      "\u201cBrief, contextless clips and participatory trends are at the heart of TikTok\u2019s popularity,\u201d  says O\u2019Connor.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s normally good and positive and funny \u2026 but when these dynamics are being used to demean, mock or stigmatise others, it does raise the question of whether TikTok should be doing more to inform or educate users.\u201d",
      "Alison Kerry, head of communications at Scope, told the BBC \"these kinds of ableist trends are deeply harmful. They don\u2019t exist in a vacuum, so a social media trend can quickly turn into someone facing abuse in their everyday life.\u201d",
      "The real-world impact is certainly becoming more noticeable.",
      "Disabled TikTokers have been posting about their experiences, and a teacher recently wrote a Reddit thread titled \u201cGetting real sick of this Timmy trend\u201d, expressing frustration at students' lack of awareness.",
      "This is why I challenged the teens at the station - I felt a duty not only to my 12-year-old self, who once burst into tears feeling helpless at similar taunts, but also to disabled students today.",
      "I returned a second time when the boys called out \u201cTimmy\u201d again after I turned to leave.",
      "\u201cWhy?\u201d I asked forcefully. Silence. One of the group eventually apologised, admitting the behaviour was wrong.",
      "\u201cSpeak to your friends,\u201d I pleaded, sensing a glimmer of hope. \u201cMaybe then they\u2019ll listen.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",
      "\u201cIt's hard not to go overboard with admiration for a nonagenarian who remains so unaffected by her fame on the one hand,\u201d wrote one, \u201cand some of the awful things life has thrown at her on the other.\u201d",
      "She held a special place in the nation\u2019s heart as queen of its longest-running radio drama, and was thought of with enormous affection by her fellow cast members.",
      "June \u201cshone through sadness without a word of complaint,\" recalled Charles Collingwood - who plays Brian Aldridge, her fictional son-in-law, \u201cand always remained immense fun\"."

    "summary": "Milena Sanchez quit The Receipts last year, one of the UK's biggest podcasts, after a co-host rift.",
    "story": [
      "Just over a year ago, Milena Sanchez suddenly left one of the UK's most successful podcasts in a split that seemed to shock everyone - even her co-hosts.",
      "For seven years, she'd built The Receipts alongside Audrey Indome and Tolani Shoneye, collecting more than 100,000 weekly listeners on the way.",
      "Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, Milena says quitting was a difficult decision but her mental health had deteriorated to a point where she couldn't carry on.",
      "\"It wasn't one I took lightly - even though it might have seemed like that,\" says Milena, 33.",
      "Audrey and Tolani said in January they were blindsided by Milena's decision to leave but Milena claimed it came after a rift that had lasted for years.",
      "There were also rumours - denied by the podcasters - that Milena was bullied and squeezed out of the group.",
      "\"Ultimately, I had to be true to who I was and remove myself from that space,\" Milena tells Newsbeat.",
      "The Receipts, which started in 2016 and signed a lucrative exclusive deal with Spotify in 2019, has about 100,000 weekly listeners on Spotify.",
      "\"Financially, I could've shut my mouth and stayed and collected the bag,\" says Milena.",
      "\"But for me, it's not about that. It meant more to me - my mental health, my integrity and who I am as a person, and to not sell something that wasn't true.",
      "\"It's not easy, and especially when I do have a daughter that depends on me.\"",
      "Milena says her daughter, who was just one year old when The Receipts started and is now almost 10, helped her find the courage to quit.",
      "\"I really had to sit down with myself and ask, if my daughter came to me with the same predicament, what would be my response to her?\" Milena says.",
      "\"My response wouldn't be to stay somewhere just because of money. It would just be, 'choose yourself'.",
      "\"You only live once and I know it sounds so clich\u00e9d, but you can't be stuck in a space where you just don't feel happy.\"",
      "Milena says her year since quitting The Receipts has been a \"whirlwind\".",

    "story": [
      "The most senior doctor in NHS England has said he was \"personally terrified\" that hospitals could have been overwhelmed in the early stages of the pandemic.",
      "Prof Sir Stephen Powis told the Covid inquiry officials had drawn up a draft document advising whose care should be prioritised if the NHS found itself unable to cope with the surge in patients.",
      "The 'Covid-19 decision tool' assigned points based on a patient's age, frailty and underlying conditions. A high score meant they might not be admitted to intensive care if services were overwhelmed.",
      "The tool was never issued publicly, after it became clear infections might have already reached a peak in March 2020.",
      "Sir Stephen, who still serves as national medical director at NHS England, said the senior clinicians who were asked to draw up the plans at short notice \"did a magnificent job\" that \"nobody ever wants to do\".",
      "\"But it became absolutely clear to me that this was going to be controversial, [and] that it hadn't had the opportunity to be discussed more widely with patient groups, [or] with the public,\" he added.",
      "The draft document advised doctors to score Covid patients based on three criteria, using a frailty scale.",
      "It detailed how those with a total score of more than eight points should not be admitted to intensive care if services became overwhelmed.",
      "Patients aged 70 to 75 were to be automatically assigned four points, while those aged over 80 would receive six.",
      "Extra points would be added for chronic conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes.",
      "People who were terminally ill, with a life expectancy of less than six months, would automatically be given nine points.",
      "Sir Stephen said work on the guidance document had started early in the pandemic, at a time when the number of patients in intensive care in England was doubling every 5-7 days.",
      "\"It was not clear that the public would respond to lockdown - they did wonderfully -  but that wasn't clear [at that point],\" he said.",
      "\"Frankly, I was personally terrified that the NHS was going to be overwhelmed.\"",
      "The project was halted on 28 March 2020, after it became clear the peak of the first Covid wave was approaching and the health service would not \"breach capacity\".",
      "Sir Stephen said there was also a danger the point-scoring system could have been \"used inappropriately\", replacing the individual clinical judgement of doctors.",
      "\"My recommendation to the inquiry is that we should absolutely, in the future, not try and develop one of these tools in the midst of a pandemic,\" he added.",
      "He said it was a piece of work that needed to be carried out in consultation with the public \"in normal times\".",
      "\"In my view, it's a discussion that shouldn't be government-led, it shouldn't even be led by the profession, it needs to be located within society.\""

    "summary": "Information on the menopause drugs' benefits and risks have been included in updated guidance.",
    "story": [
      "Health assessment body NICE has stressed to GPs hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be offered as the first treatment option to ease menopause symptoms.",
      "In its updated guidance, the use of talking therapy is set out as an additional method of help.",
      "After a detailed analysis of data on links between HRT and conditions such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers and dementia, NICE concluded HRT does not affect life expectancy.",
      "The guidance includes a new discussion aid to help GPs give patients the most useful information they can about the HRT drugs and what they do.",
      "HRT replaces the hormones oestrogen or progestogen, or both, when women's periods stop - normally between the ages of 45 and 55.",
      "It is administered using gels, creams, pessaries, tablets, patches or sprays and is sometimes prescribed during perimenopause, as the hormones start to fluctuate but before menstruation stops altogether.",
      "In updated menopause guidelines, NICE (the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence) says healthcare professionals should take into account a woman's personal situation, and provide all the information needed to help her make the best choice on treatment.",
      "How does Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) work?",
      "What is the menopause and what are the signs?",
      "The guidance is clear that HRT is the go-to treatment option for hot flushes and night sweats caused by the menopause.",
      "Talking therapy known as CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) is to be offered to women over 40 alongside HRT or, if the patient's individual circumstances call for it, in place of it.",
      "That is a change from draft guidelines, published in late 2023, which caused controversy by suggesting that talking therapy could replace HRT as a treatment.",
      "The level of feedback received by NICE on that point led to a longer than usual delay in issuing the final guidance.",
      "The document highlights that while there are some increased risks linked to taking HRT, it is unlikely to lengthen or shorten overall life expectancy.",
      "Easy-to-read illustrations of the likelihood of developing certain health conditions are featured. These are intended to help GPs have informed conversations with patients.",
      "Dr Marie Anne Ledingham, consultant clinical adviser to NICE, explained that an independent panel assessed available scientific evidence to come up with the information.",
      "She said the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and ovarian and endometrial cancer was no higher among women aged 45 and over taking combined HRT, compared to those who had never taken it.",
      "And HRT actually reduced the risk of fractures linked to the bone condition osteoporosis, which is more likely to develop after the menopause.",
      "But the risk of breast cancer for women did rise slightly, affecting:",

      "The risk of dementia was also slightly higher if women started taking HRT after the age of 65. In younger patients there was no elevated risk of developing dementia.",

      "Australia's government says it will introduce \"world-leading\" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media.",
      "Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the \"harm\" social media was inflicting on Australian children.",
      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "The debate: Should smartphones be banned for under 16s?",
      "US states want to ban phones in schools. It might be a challenge",
      "How mobile phones have changed our brains",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",
      "\"These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 06 Nov 2024 00:06:25 GMT",

    "story": [
      "Police will no longer be able to hold people who are being detained for mental-health reasons in police cells, under government plans for England and Wales.",
      "Officers can currently use cells as a \"place of safety\" for up to 24 hours to allow those needing immediate care to be assessed by a doctor.",
      "New legislation will also introduce additional rights for those receiving treatment, in a bid to modernise decades-old mental health laws.",
      "Charities have broadly welcomed the changes, whilst highlighting the need for better funding for mental health.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting said the \"outdated\" system was in need of changes to bring it \"in line with the 21st Century\".",
      "'I was sectioned and no one told me what was going on'",
      "'Discriminatory' mental health system overhauled",
      "People can be detained under the Mental Health Act - or sectioned - for their own safety, or the safety of others.",
      "Fully banning the use of police cells during detention was first proposed in draft legislation published under Boris Johnson's government, following a wide-ranging review of mental health laws published in 2018.",
      "But although that draft law underwent extensive scrutiny by MPs, it was not introduced to Parliament by the time of July's election.",
      "Under the current law, people who police believe are suffering from a mental disorder and are in \"immediate need of care or control\" can be detained so that they can be examined for possible treatment.",
      "Last year 34,685 people were detained under these circumstances, the majority to health settings such as a hospital A&E department.",
      "Some 314 detentions - around 1% - were to a police cell, with the proportion falling from around 4% in 2017, when restrictions on their use were tightened.",
      "Those detained in a police cell can typically only be held for 24 hours and must be assessed by a social worker and doctor during that time.",
      "A cross-party committee of MPs scrutinising the previous proposals had welcomed the ban on their use, but had called for an increase in appropriate places to detain people in healthcare settings alongside the change.",
      "Detention limits",
      "Labour had pledged to reform mental health legislation in its election manifesto -  branding existing laws, drawn up in the 1980s, as \"woefully out of date\".",
      "It had argued the current system discriminates against black people - who are more likely to be detained, according to official statistics - and had also criticised how the system treated autistic people and people with learning disabilities.",
      "Its new Mental Health Bill, to be published on Wednesday, will introduce a 28-day limit on how long autistic people and people with learning disabilities can be detained, unless they have a co-occurring mental health condition.",
      "It will also give people enhanced rights to select a person to represent their interests, and introduce additional requirements on clinicians to consult with people close to patients about their care.",
      "The rules on granting community treatment orders, which impose certain monitoring conditions on detained people discharged from hospital, are also expected to be changed.",
      "The health department said their use would be made more \"proportionate\", although it did not offer details.",
      "'Human rights scandal'",
      "The bill is set to largely mirror proposals included in the draft Tory law, including raising the threshold to detain people, and requiring that there is a realistic prospect that suggested treatment would have a therapeutic benefit.",
      "One area where it is expected to differ is in granting patients the right to draw up a document setting out their treatment preferences if they become unwell.",
      "The Conservative government had rejected making this a legal right, arguing that its preference was to retain flexibility in the system and it did not want to create a hierarchy of different documents.",
      "Labour has previously said the changes in the bill would take a number of years to implement fully, to give time to \"recruit and train more clinical and judicial staff\".",
      "The National Autistic Society said it welcomed the bill as a chance to end the \"human rights scandal\" of inappropriate detention.",
      "Mental health charity Mind also said the bill would move England and Wales a \"step closer to a more progressive mental health system,\" whilst adding that \"proper funding\" would be required to ease the \"mental health emergency\"."

    "story": [
      "Treasury minister Darren Jones has said the UK government's commitment to Ukraine is \"resolute\" amid fears incoming US President Donald Trump could push the country into giving up territory to Russia.",
      "Jones told BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, \"Ukraine should be able to recover its country as it was previously structured\" and that there \"shouldn't be an element of conceding to illegal invasions from Russia\".",
      "He added he would not comment on \"hypothetical scenarios\" of a future US administration.",
      "Speaking to the same programme, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel said the UK had to find a \"shared way of working with the US\" on Ukraine.",
      "During the election campaign, Trump characterised the Russia-Ukraine conflict as a drain on US resources and said he could end the war between Russia and Ukraine \"in a day\".",
      "The president-elect has not offered details of how he would resolve the conflict,",
      "However, a research paper written by two of his former national security advisers has argued that the US should continue its weapons supply to Ukraine, but make the support conditional on Kyiv entering peace talks with Russia.",
      "To entice Russia, the West would promise to delay Ukraine\u2019s entry into Nato, the military alliance of European and North American nations.",
      "The former advisers argued Ukraine should not give up its hopes of getting its territory back from Russian occupation, but that it should negotiate based on current front lines.",

      "What Trump's win means for Ukraine, Middle East and China",
      "Russia suffers worst month for casualties, says UK defence chief",
      "Asked how the UK government would respond if Trump did compel Ukraine to make territorial concessions, Jones said: \"Our commitment to Ukraine as a country here in the UK is resolute.",
      "\"We continue to support Ukraine with billions of pounds of funding every year and support from our armed forces in line with our commitments through Nato.\"",
      "Asked if the UK still respected Ukraine's desire to get back territories such as Crimea, Jones said: \"That is the basis on which the UK is operating.\"",
      "Dame Priti, who was appointed shadow foreign secretary earlier this week, agreed Ukraine should not have to concede Crimea.",
      "\u201cNo, of course not,\" she said adding: \"We\u2019ve been unequivocal as Conservatives in government\u2026 we stand shoulder to shoulder with Ukraine.\"",
      "She added that Trump \u201chasn\u2019t entered the White House yet\u201d and it would be wrong to speculate on future US foreign policy.",
      "\"I think, take one step back, let\u2019s be mature about this.",
      "\"We need to have dialogue and this comes back to having a strong relationship with our closest ally.",
      "\"I would urge our government going forward to be constructive in those discussions.\"",
      "Speaking to the same programme, Chief of the UK Defence Staff Sir Tony Radakin said Russia had suffered its worst ever month for casualties since the start of the Ukraine war, with around 1,500 dying or wounded every single day.",
      "Sir Tony said the losses were \"for tiny increments of land\" but that there was \"no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine\".",
      "\"Russia is spending over 40% of its public expenditure now on defence and security - that is an enormous drain on Russia as a country.",
      "\"I\u2019m saying the longer the war goes on, the more difficult it is.\"",
      "He reiterated the UK government's stance that Western allies would be resolute for \"as long as it takes\" adding: \"That\u2019s the message President Putin has to absorb and the reassurance for President Zelensky.\"",
      "Former Labour minister Lord Peter Mandelson said: \"Whatever happens to the fringes of Ukraine territory - and in that I don\u2019t think anyone should be dictating to the Ukrainians what they do - what is sacrosanct is their freedom. That\u2019s not up for grabs.\"",
      "He said the UK should work with the US to secure Ukraine's freedom and its borders to ensure Russia \"can't invade again\".",
      "He added that would be possible, not by offering Ukraine Nato membership, but by building \"stronger, deeper\" economic relationships with the country.",
      "There have been reports that Lord Mandelson could be appointed the UK's new ambassador to the United States.",
      "Asked if he was in the frame for the high-profile position, he said: \"Nobody has spoken to me about this job.\"",
      "On whether he would be interested, he said he would be \"very interested indeed in giving advice about trade to whoever is appointed\".",
      "In addition to criticising the amount the US is spending to support Ukraine, Trump has also repeatedly urged Nato members to spend more on their own defence, accusing European countries of free-riding on America.",
      "Nato countries are expected to spend 2% of their national income on defence. At the moment 23 countries - including the UK - meet the target, compared to just six in 2021.",
      "The Labour government has committed to increasing spending from 2.3% to 2.5% - but has not set a date for hitting the figure.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 15:45:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Hospitality bosses are calling for changes to what they describe as \"unsustainable\" tax rises.",
    "story": [
      "Top pub and restaurant bosses have warned the chancellor that tax rises in last month's Budget will \"unquestionably\" cause closures and job losses.",
      "In a letter, more than 200 signatories have said the hospitality industry is disproportionately impacted by an \"unsustainable\" hike in the amount employers pay in National Insurance contributions (NICs).",
      "It adds that businesses have \"no capacity to pass the costs onto customers\", which would instead lead to job cuts and closures of smaller firms.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has said that her National Insurance changes for businesses will generate \u00a325bn, which would aid funding of public services, such as the NHS.",
      "From April, the rate employers pay in National Insurance will rise from 13.8% to 15%, and the threshold at which they start paying the tax on each employee's salary will be reduced from \u00a39,100 per year to \u00a35,000.",
      "Darren Jones, chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme that the changes had been designed in a way \"that tried to limit the extra cost on small business\".",
      "Signatories of the letter include Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UKHospitality, the bosses of pub firms Fuller's and Stonegate Group, and Premier Inn's owner, Whitbread.",
      "They are supported by a further 209 businesses, together employing tens of thousands of people across the UK.",
      "According to the letter, the cost increases will cause jobs to be \"drastically\" cut and hours to be reduced for workers.",
      "Ms Nicholls told the BBC that firms in the industry facing these \"tough decisions\" may also reconsider investing.",
      "\"We understand that the government has a tough job to do,\" she said, but urged politicians to \"have a rethink\".",
      "Jones said that the government would not reassess the plan, and that many employers would pay the same in NI contributions as they do now, or less.",
      "\"I think the public would recognise that bigger businesses are able to burden some of the contributions that we need to make to the state.",
      "\"Getting the NHS back on its feet so workers who are off sick can get back to work is probably something that we'd say we'd all benefit from,\" he added.",
      "Impact on lower earners",
      "The letter from industry bosses suggests that changes in the NICs threshold are \"regressive in their impact on lower earners and will impact flexible working practices which many older workers and parents rely upon\".",
      "The signatories are calling for the government to consider one of two measures to \"protect businesses who employ low earners\"  to mitigate the impact.",
      "Suggested measures are a new employer NICs band which would apply between \u00a35,000 and \u00a39,100 at a lower rate of 5%, or implementing an exemption for taxpayers working fewer than 20 hours per week.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has calculated that three quarters of the impact of the NI changes will be felt by employees as bosses hold back on pay rises and hiring in the face of higher wage bills.",
      "During a select committee hearing on Tuesday, the OBR's Prof David Miles said it was \"very plausible\" this would disproportionately affect lower-paid workers.",
      "The changes set out in the Budget are, however, predicted to raise some \u00a325bn a year, making it one of the biggest single tax-raising measures in history.",
      "The chancellor has previously said that she was not immune to \"criticism\" over the move, but has argued that it will put public finances on a \"firm footing\".",
      "The hospitality industry's letter follows on from big British supermarkets such as M&S and Sainsbury's hinting that they may put up prices in a bid to offset higher wage bills.",
      "Sainsbury's chief executive Simon Roberts said on Thursday that the NI changes would cost the business around \u00a3140m - a sum which does not include the increases to minimum wage.",
      "The boss of Wetherspoons also said earlier this week that following the Budget, taxes and business costs were \"expected to increase by approximately \u00a360m\".",
      "Its chairman said that he believed many food and drink businesses planned to pass costs on to customers.",
      "Amid criticism from the hospitality sector, Rachel Reeves is expected to unveil pension reforms this week which are intended to channel money into private businesses and infrastructure.",
      "At her first Mansion House speech in the City of London, Ms Reeves will pitch \"growth brought by unlocking private sector investment, including in our financial services industry, and growth brought about by reform - both of our economy and of our public services\".",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 07:43:38 GMT",
    "summary": "The Labour government is expected to make major changes to the Right To Buy scheme launched in the 1980s.",
    "story": [
      "When Harold Wilson was Labour prime minister in the late 1960s, up to a third of people in England lived in a council house or flat.",
      "But by the time Keir Starmer became prime minister in July this year, the proportion of people in England living in social housing had fallen to about 16% of the population \u2013 about four million.",
      "About two million council-built properties have been sold to their tenants at significantly discounted prices under the Right To Buy (RTB) scheme since it was introduced by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government in the early 1980s.",
      "Michael Heseltine described the advent of RTB as \"laying the foundations of one of the most important social revolutions of the century\", but was selling off council houses more cheaply than new ones could be built simply laying the foundations of a housing crisis?",
      "Waiting lists",
      "Historically, money raised from selling off council houses has not gone far towards building new ones - new ones desperately needed, considering about 1.3 million people are on waiting lists for them in England.",
      "Across the north-west of England, for example, about 4,350 council houses have been sold off in the last 10 years, with the money made from the sales going towards building or buying just over 1,400 others, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "While the \u00a3336,612,000 raised from those sales may sound a reasonable sum, it works out on average at about \u00a377,000 per house. And, generally, councils have not been allowed to keep the whole amount, instead having to hand a sizeable chunk back to the government.",
      "About 200,000 people are on waiting lists for social housing in the region.",
      "While housing associations may have built homes, and there may have been schemes funded by cash from other government pots, the fact that the money raised from selling off homes is nowhere near enough to rebuild or buy like-for-like has been a long-standing concern.",
      "And it would seem Labour deputy prime minister and minister for housing Angela Rayner \u2013 who famously bought her own council house in Stockport under RTB \u2013 has taken on board the views of RTB critics.",
      "Rayner has said recently she may impose restrictions so that people who move into newly built council houses will not be able to buy them in the future.",
      "It is a decision that is likely to be welcomed by Labour politicians in regions where the need for social housing is arguably as great as ever, but the amount of it available is very low.",
      "The Labour metro-mayors of both Liverpool and Manchester regions have both said they want to see more social housing built in their regions.",
      "In May, Andy Burnham, leader of Greater Manchester, called on the-then Conservative government to pause RTB on new builds after losing 500 social homes to the scheme in 2022.",
      "He argued that if planned homes could be bought by their tenants, it would be \"like trying to fill a bath without the plug in\".",
      "On Merseyside, virtually all former council housing stock was transferred to housing associations over the last two decades.",
      "But metro mayor Steve Rotheram says registered social landlords (RSLs) have inherited some of the problems that came with RTB.",
      "He says one Merseyside RSL had lost about a third of its homes through sales to tenants in the decade since the housing stock was transferred.",
      "People who are tenants of RSLs can buy their homes under \u201cpreserved\u201d RTB if they lived in their homes when the council owned them.",
      "And once someone has lived in an RSL property for three years, they can apply for the Right To Acquire.",
      "Rotheram says cheaper borrowing rates for RSLs and a moratorium on sales would help boost growth in social housing.",
      "\"You are not going to build a lot of houses for someone to come along in three or four years and buy it below market value,\" he says.",
      "\"How we deal with this is part of our growth plan going to the government, and we are now trying to see if we can work with [Rayner] to come up with proposals.\"",
      "Blackpool Council\u2019s cabinet member for economy and the built environment, Mark Smith, is clear that while the money generated from RTB sales is used to support various investments in housing, the RTB receipts his council receives are \"not sufficient to replace lost social rent housing\".",
      "And he says even with changes such as the government giving councils more flexibility to allow RTB receipts to be used alongside cash from other streams such as funds given by developers who get planning permission for private schemes, there is still some red tape in the way of using different types of funding together to build council housing.",
      "\"We do the best we can within the parameters of the policy as it exists currently but there is always room for improvement,\" he says.",
      "Under the new Labour government policies, councils and housing associations are being given \u201cmore freedom\u201d to decide how to use their RTB money.",
      "Previously, only 50% of the money a council received from a sale could go towards building or buying a new house.",
      "But in future councils will be able to use all that money, and put money received from private developers handed over as part of planning agreements into projects as well.",
      "These deals, known as Section 106 agreements, see developers give money to councils to mitigate any negative impacts their private schemes might have on local communities or housing markets.",
      "Sources within the social housing sector say that in the past the \"policy has never achieved anything like a one-for-one replacement ratio\".",
      "\"If it had then there would be a lot less concern about the policy,\" one says.",
      "\"Yes, a Right To Buy home continues to be a home after it\u2019s sold, but it contributes to a huge loss of social housing stock and contributes to housing waiting lists, or people having to live in unsuitable accommodation.\"",
      "'Serious shortage'",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, says there is a \"serious housing shortage in this country\" and \"record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation\".",
      "Adam Hug, the LGA\u2019s housing spokesman, says: \u201cWhile the Right To Buy can and has delivered home ownership for many the scheme in its current form does not work.",
      "\"Rising discounts, alongside other measures that restrict councils\u2019 use of Right To Buy receipts, mean that the money raised from the sale of property is usually not sufficient to cover the building costs of replacing the property.",
      "\"We have long called for the removal of rules and restrictions which disincentivise local authorities from building social homes, at risk of losing them.",
      "\"Councils must be given the control, power and flexibility to use receipt monies in a way that works best for their local areas, which includes retaining 100 per cent of the receipts permanently.\"",
      "'Scandal'",
      "In 2012, the Conservative-led government increased the discount a tenant could receive when buying their home.",
      "Since coming to power, Labour has said the discount will be reduced to between \u00a316,000 and \u00a338,000, depending on the location \u2013 a significant reduction from the \u00a3136,000 discount currently available in London and the discount of just over \u00a3100,000 elsewhere.",
      "Rayner, who bought her Stockport council house under a RTB discount in 2007 and sold it several years later for \u00a348,000 more than she paid for it, said she wanted to see a \u201cfairer\u201d system.",
      "Her department says it is a \"scandal\" that only about one third of homes lost to RTB have been replaced since 2012, and that it was \"working at pace to reverse the continued decline of social rented homes\".",
      "But while the government stresses there are \"no plans to abolish the RTB\", the \"social revolution\" Lord Heseltine heralded nearly 45 years ago is clearly facing a radical change to everything but its name.",

    "summary": "David Lammy is on his first visit to the continent since he became foreign secretary.",
    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",
      "\"Africa has huge growth potential, with the continent on track to make up 25% of the world\u2019s population by 2050,\" read a statement from the office.",
      "With an ageing population in the UK - as with much of the developed world - Dr Vines says that the sharing of skills will increase.",
      "He adds that migration is an \"emotive and complicated issue\", but the UK and other Western nations should avoid \"cherry-picking the best and corroding African states from being successful themselves\".",
      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",
      "But South African analyst Yanga Molotana does not see this as a major problem.",
      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",
      "\"The concern is probably going to be more regularly raised in private,\" he says.",

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",
      "UK military satellite launches to boost space power",
      "MoD contracts Airbus for Skynet telecoms satellite",
      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",
      "\"Pieces of space junk are like ticking time bombs,\" observed Moriba Jah, a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.",
      "\"We need to avoid what I call super-spreader events. When these things explode or something collides with them, it generates thousands of pieces of debris that then become a hazard to something else that we care about.\"",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",

      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",

      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 14:21:43 GMT",
    "summary": "The Northern Taurids are at their peak on 11-12 November - but will the clouds part to let us see them?",
    "story": [
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Published9 November 2024",
      "Sky watchers are looking forward to the next meteor shower, the Northern Taurids, which are set to peak on 11-12 November.",
      "The meteors can be seen from virtually anywhere on Earth but sightings will be affected by the phase of the Moon, and the weather conditions.",
      "These showers, known for their slow-moving, long-lasting meteors, are linked to Comet Encke.",
      "There are two streams to the Taurids with the Southern Taurids having peaked earlier in the month.",
      "What is the Taurid meteor shower?",
      "The Taurid meteor shower is caused by the debris - ice and dust - from Comet Encke as it passes through our solar system.",
      "Each time Encke returns to the inner solar system, its nucleus sheds ice and rock into space into a vast debris stream. When Earth passes through this debris the \"comet crumbs\" heat up as they enter our atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.",
      "Taurid meteors tend to be larger than other meteors and can survive for longer periods as they pass through Earth's atmosphere. They also travel relatively slowly, traversing the sky at about 17 miles (27km) per second. This is about half the speed of the Perseids.",
      "A recent theory as to why Encke has such a large debris stream is that it was once part of a larger comet that broke up about 20,000 years ago. It has the shortest orbital period of any known comet within our solar system, taking just 3.3 years to orbit the Sun.",
      "When is the peak?",
      "Encke's debris stream is so large and spread out that it takes Earth a rather long time to pass through it. This is why we experience two separate parts to the shower - the Southern Taurids and the Northern Taurids.",
      "The Southern Taurids run from about 23 September to 12 November and peaked earlier this month. Northern Taurids stem from a nearby but slightly different stream and are active from about 13 October 13 to 2 December, peaking around 11-12 November.",
      "The Taurids are not very prolific, tending to produce only five meteors per hour, but they can be very bright. The showers sometimes produce fireballs \u2013 a perfect target for astrophotography.",
      "There seems to be a seven-year periodicity with these fireballs. There were lots of fireball sightings in 2022. The next best opportunity may be in 2029.",
      "How do I watch?",
      "You do not need any equipment such as telescopes or binoculars as the secret is to take in as much sky as possible and allow about 30 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark.",
      "The best time to view the Taurid meteor shower is around midnight when the shower's radiant (the spot in the sky from which the meteors appear to emanate), the Taurus constellation, is high in the sky.",
      "To find Taurus, look for the constellation Orion and then peer to the north-east to find the red star Aldebaran, the star in the bull's eye. Shooting stars will be visible all over the night sky so move your gaze around the nearby constellations.",
      "Anticyclonic gloom has settled on the UK recently bringing extensive cloud.",
      "Will I be able to see them?",
      "Viewing the Taurids may be affected by the illumination of the Moon, which could obscure some of the fainter meteors. The Moon will be in a waxing gibbous phase \u2013 going from half moon to full moon.",
      "Plus, as we have seen recently, it is hard to see anything in the sky if there is a blanket of low cloud. However, there could be some timely changes in cloud amounts at the time of peak viewing.",
      "A weather front crossing the UK on Sunday will bring a change in air mass. Even though an area of high pressure will build again, it may not contain as much cloud.",
      "It is possible that the clouds will part on Monday night and give us a better chance of seeing some spectacular meteor displays.",

      "\"This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,\" he said.",
      "While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media.",
      "There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access.",
      "Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws.",
      "The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place.",
      "While most experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are split over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together.",
      "The debate: Should smartphones be banned for under 16s?",
      "US states want to ban phones in schools. It might be a challenge",
      "How mobile phones have changed our brains",
      "Some experts argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces.",
      "Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements.",
      "One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as \"too blunt an instrument\".",
      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",
      "\"I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,\" he told reporters on Thursday.",

    "summary": "It wants commitments on prices and 5G if the creation of the UK's biggest mobile network is to go ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.",
      "But it has now provisionally concluded those concerns could be addressed - and the merger could proceed - if the firms agree to its proposed remedies.",
      "A Vodafone spokesperson said both companies would need to study the CMA's proposal more closely but believed on first impressions it \"provides a path to final clearance\".",
      "They insisted, as they have throughout, that the deal was in everyone's interests.",
      "\"It will bring significant benefits to businesses and consumers throughout the UK, and it will bring advanced 5G to every school and hospital across the country,\" they said.",
      "The CMA's findings are the latest step in its probe into the merger, which began in January.",
      "Vodafone and Three announced their plans to merge their UK-based operations in June last year.",
      "Their combined network would have around 27 million customers.",
      "\"We believe this deal has the potential to be pro-competitive for the UK mobile sector if our concerns are addressed,\" said Stuart McIntosh, who is leading the CMA panel investigating the merger.",
      "\"We anticipate in the longer term that the significant commitment to upgrade the merged companies network over the next 10 years or so will ultimately create a competitive environment that will maintain the competition we've seen in mobile in recent years,\" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.",
      "But he also made clear that short term commitments not to increase the price of certain existing mobile tariffs and data plans for at least three years were also key to making sure consumers did not lose out.",
      "The regulator also said upholding pre-agreed deals or prices with Mobile Virtual Network Operators such as Sky Mobile, Lyca and Lebara could protect consumers and and wholesale customers alike.",
      "Industry analyst Paolo Pescatore told the BBC it marked \"another key step towards approval\" and showed all concerned were trying to find a way to make the deal happen.",
      "The two largest players in the market are currently EE and 02 - Mr Pescatore said a merged Vodafone and Three would be in a better place to take them on.",
      "\"To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,\" he said.",
      "The CMA is seeking responses to its proposed remedies by 12 November, with a deadline of 7 December for a final decision on the merger."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:03:51 GMT",
    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",

      "Qatar said initial reports it had withdrawn from mediation talks and said that Hamas's political office in Doha \"no longer serves its purpose\" were \"inaccurate\".",
      "\"Qatar notified the parties 10 days ago during the last attempts to reach an agreement, that it would stall its efforts to mediate between Hamas and Israel if an agreement was not reached in that round,\" a statement from the Qatari foreign ministry said.",
      "\"Qatar will resume those efforts... when the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war.\"",
      "Hamas has had a base in the Qatari capital since 2012, reportedly at the request of the Obama administration.",
      "Several news agencies reported on Saturday that Qatar had agreed with the US to tell Hamas to close its political office in Doha due to \"a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith\".",
      "But the foreign ministry said the reports were \"inaccurate\". The claims have also been denied by Hamas officials.",
      "The small but influential Gulf state is a key US ally in the region. It hosts a major American air base and has handled many delicate political negotiations, including with Iran, the Taliban and Russia.",
      "Alongside the US and Egypt, the Qataris have also played a major role in rounds of so-far unsuccessful talks to broker a ceasefire in the year-long war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "But there is growing evidence of a shift in the relationship.",
      "After the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, Hamas held a two-hour mourning tent in Doha in a small hall, a stark contrast to the recent three-day mourning held for Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, which was conducted with official state oversight and security.",
      "The latest round of talks in mid-October failed to produce a deal, with Hamas rejecting a short-term ceasefire proposal. The group has always called for a complete end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza.",
      "The Qatari foreign ministry statement said: \"Media reports regarding the Hamas office in Doha is inaccurate.\"",
      "\"The main goal of the office in Qatar is to be a channel of communication... [which] has contributed to achieving a ceasefire in previous stages.\"",
      "Israel has also been accused of rejecting deals. Days after being fired earlier this week, former Defence Minister Yoav Gallant accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of rejecting a peace deal against the advice of his security chiefs.",
      "The call for Hamas to be expelled from Qatar appears to be an attempt by the outgoing Biden administration to force some sort of peace deal before the end of his term in January.",
      "Were Hamas to be forced to leave Doha, it is unclear where they would base their political office. Key ally Iran would be an option, although the assassination of former leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July suggests they may be at risk from Israel if based there. It would also not give them anything close to the same diplomatic channels to the West.",
      "A more likely option would be Turkey. As a Nato member but also a Sunni majority state, it would give the group a base from which to operate in relative safety. Last April President Erdogan hosted then Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh and his delegation in Istanbul, where they talked about \u201cwhat needs to be done to ensure adequate and uninterrupted delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza, and a fair and lasting peace process in the region\".",
      "The move would also most likely be welcomed by Ankara, which has often sought to position itself as a broker between east and west.",
      "Key Hamas figures such as Osama Hamdan, Taher al-Nunu, and others frequently featured on news outlets have been staying in Istanbul for over a month.",
      "Their extended presence in Turkey marks a departure from past visits, which were typically limited to brief stays.",
      "It is thought the personal safety of Hamas leadership is now a major concern for the group, which saw two leaders killed in less than four months. As well as Haniyeh\u2019s death in July, in October Israel killed Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the 7 October Hamas attack on southern Israel.",
      "According to the European Council of Foreign Relations, \u201cHamas has adopted a temporary model of collective leadership to mitigate the effect of future Israeli assassinations\u201d.",
      "H A Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), told the BBC that nowhere \u201cwill give them protection from Israeli assassination attempts in the same way that being in Doha, where America has its largest military base in the region, did\u201d.",
      "The latest move comes as US officials appear increasingly frustrated with the approach the Israeli government has taken to ending the war. In October, the US Secretaries of State and Defense said if Israel did not allow more humanitarian aid into the territory by 12 November, they would face unspecified policy \u201cimplications\u201d.",
      "Last weekend a number of UN officials warned the situation in northern Gaza was \u201capocalyptic\u201d. On Saturday the independent Famine Review Committee said there was a \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas\u201d.",
      "The relationship between President Joe Biden and Netanyahu has deteriorated over the course of the war in Gaza, with increasing pressure from Washington to improve the humanitarian situation for the Palestinians and find some sort of negotiated settlement.",
      "Nearly 70% of Gaza war dead are women and children, UN says",
      "Gaza\u2019s top Islamic scholar issues fatwa criticising 7 October attack",
      "Palestinians leave Gaza in rare medical evacuation",
      "But, according to Dr Hellyer, US attempts at negotiation have been fatally flawed.",
      "\u201cBy setting red lines and allowing Netanyahu to cross them without consequence, the Biden administration effectively encouraged further impunity. I don\u2019t think any of this will change in the next 10 weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "Any overtures have been repeatedly rejected by Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition, who will now also feel emboldened by the prospect of an incoming Donald Trump presidency.",
      "While exactly what approach Trump will take to the region remains uncertain, he is thought to be more likely to allow Israel to act on its terms.",
      "He has previously said Israel should \u201cfinish what they started\u201d in Gaza. During his last term in the White House, he took a number of steps deemed highly favourable to Israel, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem.",
      "It has also been reported, however, that Trump has told Netanyahu that he wants to see an end to the fighting by the time he takes office.",
      "Either way, it seems likely that the current US administration will have less influence over the government in Jerusalem.",
      "They may therefore believe the best way to force some sort of deal is to apply pressure on Hamas.  Whether it pays off may depend on whether Qatar, so long a reliable ally, decides to go along with it."

    "summary": "The smog covering Pakistan's second largest city has been captured in satellite images.",
    "story": [
      "Smog starts slow.",
      "At first, you cannot see it but you can smell it. It smells like something is burning. And it intensifies as the temperature drops.",
      "Then the smoke and fog start to envelop you and the city around you. Now you can see it. You are walking through the smoke, a thick ceiling of it hanging overhead.",
      "If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air.",
      "Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx.",
      "Lahore and its 13 million residents have now been choking for a week; the air quality index has passed the 1,000 mark repeatedly this month - anything above 300 is considered hazardous.",
      "Pakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year.",
      "Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas.",
      "By the end of the week, Lahore High Court had ordered all the markets in the Punjab province to close by 20:00 each night, with complete closures on Sundays. Parks and zoos have also been shut until 17 November.",
      "The problem, according to Nasa scientist Pawan Gupta, is that pollution levels in the city \u201ctypically peak in late November and December\u201d.",
      "\u201cSo this is just beginning. The worst pollution days are probably still ahead of us,\u201d he warned.",
      "The smoke that has enveloped Lahore, in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab province, can be seen from space - as can part of the cause.",
      "Satellite images from the US space agency Nasa shows both the thick layer of smog and the multiple concentrations of fire in the region between the Indian capital, Delhi, and Pakistan\u2019s Lahore.",
      "The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires.",
      "A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India -  a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.",
      "This year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years.",
      "According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue.",
      "But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.",
      "Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air.",
      "And in the final months of the year, it all combines with cold air flowing down from Tibet, creating the smog which is currently sitting over the city.",
      "It is clear the toxic air is making people sick.",
      "According to the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Air Quality Index (AQI), a value of 50 or below indicates good air quality, while a value above 300 signals Hazardous air quality.",

      "The danger is a constant concern for Lahore resident Sadia Kashif.",
      "\u201cLike every mother, I want to see my children run and play without fearing pollution,\u201d she tells the BBC.",
      "\u201cI see my children struggle with coughs and breathing problems these days, and it is a painful reminder that our air has become extremely toxic.\u201d",
      "But the current \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d has left her unimpressed.",
      "\u201cIt is easy for the government to shut down school rather than taking real steps to address the crisis,\u201d says Kashif.",
      "For years, authorities have struggled to find a solution to Lahore\u2019s pollution problem.",
      "The government hopes short fixes will provide reprieve, but says long term solutions - like improving public transport - will take time.",
      "In the meantime, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz announced this week she intends to write a letter to her counterpart in Indian Punjab to invite them to engage in \u201cclimate diplomacy\u201d, since it impacts both regions. Delhi says it is yet to hear from Pakistan on the issue.",
      "However, Omar points out air pollution is not a seasonal problem but a persistent issue.",
      "\u201cLahore is much more polluted than Delhi with pollution episodes that last longer and reach higher peaks,\u201d he notes.",
      "And it is getting worse, he believes. As per his own analysis of data, October has seen a 25% rise in pollution level compared to the same period last year.",
      "Governments on both sides of the border need to act swiftly to deal with the issue, he argues.",
      "\u201cThe roadmap to clean air is clear, but the present policies from both India and Pakistan aren\u2019t enough to significantly reduce pollution.\u201d",

      "In October 2024, there were more than 480,000 visitors, putting the average at about 15,500 a day. The busiest month so far this year was May, when about 517,000 people visited, or some 16,700 a day.",
      "The 20,000 cap is likely to only lead to tourists being turned away on a handful of occasions. A spokesperson for the park told Reuters that it had only exceeded 20,000 visitors when entry is free on the first Sunday of the month, as well as three or four fee-paying days.",
      "Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the park's director, said that reducing the effects of human visitors at Pompeii was important for conservation and safety reasons.",

      "Older, white conservatives were reducing in number, and non-white Americans were projected to be in the majority by 2044. College-educated professionals, younger people, black Americans, Latinos and other ethnic minorities, and blue-collar workers were part of a \u201ccoalition of the ascendant\u201d.",
      "These voters were left-leaning on cultural issues and supportive of an active federal government and a strong social safety net. And they constituted a majority in enough states to ensure a Democratic lock on the Electoral College \u2013 and the presidency.",

While Joe Biden, with his working-class-friendly reputation built over half a century, won enough back to take the White House in 2020, his success proved to be only a temporary reprieve.",
      "How small gains delivered Trump a big win",
      "Why Latinos flocked to Trump's coalition",
      "This year, Trump supplemented his gains with the blue-collar workers by also cutting into the Democratic margins among young, Latino and black voters. He has carved up the coalition of the ascendant.",
      "According to exit polls, Trump won:",
      "- 13% of the black vote in 2024 compared to Republican John McCain\u2019s 4% against Obama",
      "- 46% of the Latino vote this time, while McCain got 31% in 2008",
      "- 43% of voters under 30 against the 32% for McCain",

      "Immigration and identity politics",
      "Trump did it with a hard-line message on immigration that included border enforcement and mass deportations \u2013 policies that Biden and the Democrats recoiled from when they took power back from Trump in 2021, lest they anger immigrant rights activists in their liberal base.",
      "Illegal border crossings reached record levels under the Biden administration, with more than eight million encounters with migrants at the border with Mexico.",

      "This week, Trump became the first Republican since 1988 to win that heavily Latino county in Florida. He also won Starr County in south Texas, with its 97% Latino population, with 57% of the vote. In 2008, only 15% of the county voted for McCain, the Republican.",
      "Mike Madrid, an anti-Trump Republican strategist who specialises in Latino voting trends, told the BBC that the problem with \u201cdemography is destiny\u201d was that it risked treating all non-white Americans as an \u201caggrieved racial minority\u201d. \u201cBut that is not and nor has it ever been the way Latinos have viewed themselves,\u201d he added.",

He said he agreed with Republicans on some things and felt Democratic politicians took black voters for granted.",
      "With some states still tabulating their results, Trump currently has improved on his electoral margins in at least 2,367 US counties, while slipping in just 240.",
      "It wasn\u2019t just the number of counties that Trump won that made a difference, either. Kamala Harris needed to post significant margins in the cities to offset Republican strength in rural areas. She consistently fell short.",
      "In Detroit\u2019s Wayne County, for example, which the latest US Census reports is 38% black, Harris won 63% of the vote \u2013 significantly lower than Joe Biden\u2019s 68% in 2020 and Obama\u2019s 74% in 2008.",
      "Polls consistently suggested that the economy, along with immigration, were the two issues of highest importance to voters - and where polls indicated Trump had an advantage over Harris.",
      "His economic message cut across racial divides.",

      "Various elements within the party are offering their own, often conflicting, advice on the best path from the wilderness back to power.",
      "Left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders, who twice ran for the Democratic presidential nomination, also criticised identity politics and accused the party of abandoning working-class voters.",
      "Some centrist Democrats, meanwhile, have argued that the struggle to connect with voters goes beyond the economy and immigration. They point to how the Trump campaign was also able to use a cultural message as a wedge to fracture the Democratic coalition.",
      "Pelosi blames Biden for election loss as finger pointing intensifies",
      "Who's in the frame to join Trump's new top team?",
      "Among the positions that Republicans targeted in this year\u2019s election were calls to shift funding away from law enforcement, decriminalise undocumented border-crossings and minor crimes like shoplifting, and provide greater protections for transgender Americans.",
      "Many arose after the murder of George Floyd in 2020 and the resulting rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as other efforts to advance social justice and acknowledge darker parts of American history.",
      "Within a few years, however, some of those positions proved a liability for Democrats when trying to win over persuadable voters and keep their coalition from fraying. Harris, for example, backed away from some positions she\u2019d taken when she first ran for president in 2019.",
      "In the last month of the presidential campaign, the Trump team made the vice-president\u2019s past support for taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners and detained immigrants a central focus.",
      "One advert ended with the line: \u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "The Trump campaign spent more than $21m on transgender issue ads in the first half of October \u2013 about a third of their entire advertising expenditures and nearly double what they spent on spots on immigration and inflation, according to data compiled by AdImpact.",
      "It\u2019s the kind of investment a campaign makes if it has hard data showing an advert is moving public opinion.",
      "After Trump\u2019s convincing win, Congressman Seth Moulton, a moderate from Massachusetts, said his party needed to rethink its approach on cultural issues.",
      "\u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,\u201d Moulton told the New York Times. \u201cI have two little girls, I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Progressive Democrats, meanwhile, reject that characterisation, and argue that standing up for the rights of minorities has always been a core value of the party. Congressman John Moran wrote on X in response: \"You should find another job if you want to use an election loss as an opportunity to pick on our most vulnerable.\u201d",
      "Mike Madrid, the political strategist, has a brutal assessment of where the Democratic coalition is today.",
      "\u201cThe Democratic Party was predicated on what really is an unholy alliance between working-class people of colour and wealthier white progressives driven and animated by cultural issues,\u201d Madrid said. \u201cThe only glue holding that coalition together was anti-Republicanism.\u201d",
      "Once that glue came unstuck, he said, the party was ripe for defeat.",
      "Future elections are sure to be held in a friendlier political environment for Democrats. And Trump, who has shown a unique ability to attract new and low-propensity voters to the polls, has run his last campaign.",
      "But 2024\u2019s results will provide plenty of fuel for Democratic angst in the days to come.",
      "The Harris campaign itself believes she lost to Trump because she was facing a restive public angry over the economic and social turbulence in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic.",
      "\u201cYou stared down unprecedented headwinds and obstacles that were largely out of our control,\u201d campaign chair Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon wrote in a letter to her staff. \u201cThe whole country moved to the right, but compared to the rest of the country, the battleground states saw the least amount of movement in his direction. It was closest in the places we competed.\u201d",

But when he spoke to the BBC this week, he was not so convinced the Democrats had delivered when in power - or that their message today connected with Americans like him.",

      "Other contenders for the job include biotech entrepreneur and 2024 Republican presidental candidate Vivek Ramaswamy; Trump's former national security adviser Robert O'Brien; Tennessee Senator Bill Hagerty, who was previously Trump's ambassador to Japan; and Brian Hook, the hawkish special envoy to Iran in Trump's first term and the man who is leading the transition effort at the State Department.",
      "A dark horse for the nomination, however, is Richard Grenell, a loyalist who served as ambassador to Germany, special envoy to the Balkans and acting national intelligence chief. Grenell, 58, was heavily involved in Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and even sat in on his private meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in September.",
      "Intelligence/ national security posts",
      "Grenell's combative style may make him a better fit for national security adviser - a position that does not require Senate confirmation - than secretary of state.",
      "Also in line for major posts in a second Trump term are former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe; Keith Kellogg, a national security adviser to Trump's first Vice-President Mike Pence; former defence department official Eldridge Colby; and Kash Patel, a loyalist who staffed the national security council and became chief of staff to the acting secretary of defence in Trump's final months in office.",
      "Patel, 44, who helped block the transition to the incoming Joe Biden administration in the latter role, is tipped to become the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) chief.",
      "Trump has also said he would fire Federal Bureau of Intelligence (FBI) Director Chris Wray, who he nominated in 2017 but has since fallen out with. Jeffrey Jensen, a former Trump-appointed US attorney, is under consideration to replace Wray.",
      "Defence secretary",
      "Trump has previously singled out Christopher Miller, his final acting defence secretary, as a candidate who could be nominated to lead the military.",
      "Miller, a retired Army Special Forces colonel, ran the National Counterterrorism Center and - more recently - authored the defence chapter of the controversial Project 2025 wish list for a second Trump term, though Trump has distanced himself from the document.",
      "Other names being discussed include Michael Waltz, a Florida lawmaker who sits on the armed services committee in the US House of Representatives, and Robert O'Brien.",
      "UN ambassador",
      "During Trump's first term, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik transformed from a moderate to a vocal backer. The fourth-ranking House Republican leader has remained one of Trump's most fiercely loyal defenders on Capitol Hill - which makes her a leading contender to represent him in unfriendly territory at the United Nations.",
      "But she may find herself competing for the position with the likes of former State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus; David Friedman, Trump's ambassador to Israel; and Kelly Craft, who served as UN ambassador at the end of Trump\u2019s term.",
      "Treasury secretary",
      "Trump is reportedly considering Robert Lighthizer, a free trade sceptic who led the  tariff war with China as the US trade representative, as his chief financial officer.",
      "But at least four others may be under consideration for the role, including Scott Bessent, a billionaire hedge fund manager who has become a major fundraiser and economic adviser to the president-elect; John Paulson, another megadonor from the hedge fund world; former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Jay Clayton; and Fox Business Network financial commentator Larry Kudlow, who ran Trump's national economic council during his first term.",
      "Commerce secretary",
      "The woman co-chairing Trump's transition team, Linda McMahon, is tipped as a key contender to represent US businesses and job creation in his cabinet - after previously serving as small business administrator during his first term.",
      "Others who could fill this vacancy include Brooke Rollins; Robert Lighthizer; and Kelly Loeffler, a wealthy businesswoman who briefly served in the US Senate.",
      "Interior secretary",
      "South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem - who was passed over to be Trump's running mate in part over a bizarre admission that she killed her pet dog - could see her loyalty to him pay off with the leadership of the interior department, which manages public land and natural resources.",

      "A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth.",
      "Former energy secretary Dan Brouillette is also reportedly in the running.",
      "Press secretary",
      "Karoline Leavitt, 27, who impressed Trump as his campaign's national press secretary, has already served as an assistant White House press secretary and may be a shoo-in to be the administration's spokesperson.",

      "He is on a shortlist to run the health and human services department, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner.",
      "Despite having no medical qualifications to his name, Kennedy, 70, is expected to become a kind of \"public health tsar\" in the Trump administration.",
      "There has been speculation about his inability to pass a background check for security clearance due to past controversies, including dumping a bear carcass in New York's Central Park.",
      "Besides a new job at the health and human services department, Kennedy could also influence policy at the agriculture department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Safety Administration (FDA).",

      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "Analysis - Why Kamala Harris lost",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",

      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 04:21:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Building the link to western Europe has become more urgent as the Baltics see Russia as a threat.",
    "story": [
      "The three Baltic states came up with the idea years ago for a high-speed railway spanning 870km (540 miles) across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.",
      "Rail Baltica began as a grand project, but it has now become a strategic imperative: since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the Baltics increasingly view their neighbour as an existential threat.",
      "Currently, there is no direct link that crosses the Baltics and connects with Poland.",
      "Rail Baltica will do that, cutting travel time and bringing economic and environmental benefits, but the costs of this ambitious scheme are mounting.",
      "Meanwhile, Baltic states and their Nato allies need the railway in place fast.",
      "Estonia's Infrastructure Minister Vladimir Svet said the rail link is vital amid the Russian war in Ukraine.",
      "\u201cHistory is repeating itself,\u201d he said. \u201cPutin's aggressive regime is trying to recreate an imperial project on the territory of the former Soviet bloc.\"",
      "The memory of decades of Soviet occupation is still fresh in the Baltics. Moscow deported hundreds of thousands of people from the region to Siberia.",
      "Estonia and Latvia share land borders with Russia, while Lithuania is adjacent to the Russian enclave Kaliningrad, which also shares a border with Poland, and Moscow's close ally, Belarus.",
      "About 10,000 Nato soldiers are currently stationed in the Baltics, alongside local troops. Their total number could reach 200,000 in a worst-case scenario.",
      "\u201cRail Baltica will increase military mobility and allow trains to go directly from the Netherlands to Tallinn,\u201d Cmdr Peter Nielsen, from Nato's Force Integration Unit, said.",
      "For Estonia's infrastructure minister, the railway is \u201can unbreakable link with the networks of Europe\u201d.",
      "Not far from the Estonian capital, Tallinn, at the tip of the railway, dozens of workers are welding and hammering away at the new \u00dclemiste passenger terminal.",
      "\u201cThis will be the network's most northern point, the starting point of 215km of railway in Estonia and 870km across the three Baltic States,\u201d said Anvar Salomets, CEO of Rail Baltica Estonia, stepping carefully across the embryonic platforms.",
      "Until now, the Baltics have used a Russian track width because their rail system dates back to the Soviet era.",
      "Passengers have to change trains to the European system when they get to the Polish border.",
      "The new network will use the European railway track width and connect seamlessly with railways across the EU.",
      "LISTEN: Building a geopolitical railway",
      "Baltic concerns over plans to move Russia's sea borders",
      "\u201cThe trains will run at up to 250km/h (155mph) compared with 80 or 120km/h (50 or 74mph) right now,\u201d Salomets added.",
      "That means journey times from Tallinn to the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, will be massively reduced, from at least 12 hours now to under four.",
      "\u201cIt'll be a game-changer, decreasing the environmental impact across our whole transport sector,\u201d says Salomets, who foresees big economic benefits.",
      "Recent analysis for the Rail Baltica consortium estimates the overall economic boost at \u20ac6.6bn (\u00a35.5bn).",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of studies of existing high speed rail systems show a positive economic impact,\u201d said Adam Cohen of the University of California at Berkeley.",
      "But those benefits will not appear overnight and there is growing concern at the spiralling cost. Developers' estimates have increased fourfold since 2017 and now stand at \u20ac24bn.",
      "So far, the EU has subsidised 85% of the project and has just announced another \u20ac1.1bn.",
      "Estonia and Latvia have also come under criticism for focusing on putting up the rail terminals first before they build the mainline.",
      "French engineer Emilien Dang, whose RB Rail oversees the project, blamed recent global crises for the big spike in costs: \u201cOur initial estimate hadn't taken into account the Covid pandemic and high inflation - and the situation in Ukraine has dramatically increased the cost of material.\u201d",
      "As he walked across a big new terminal in the Latvian capital Riga, he also cited cultural issues.",
      "\u201cThe view from France, wrongly, is that the Baltics are one unit.  But they are three countries, with different regulations.\u201d",
      "The Baltic states have decided to split the project into two phases. The first, costing \u20ac15bn, will have a single instead of double track laid by 2030 and focus on the most important train stops.",
      "The second track and additional train stations are to be completed as part of a second phase with no specific completion date yet.",
      "The soaring costs have prompted the states to scale back some of their ambitions.",
      "\u201cWe can further scale back the scope of phase one, for example by connecting Riga airport at a later stage,\u201d said Andris Kulbergs, who chairs a Latvian parliamentary committee investigating the project.",
      "As billions of euros for the first phase are yet to be secured, that might be necessary.",
      "Estonia's national auditor Janar Holm believes several more years of delays are likely: \u201cWe have to find the funds to build this railway now or it'll be even more expensive.\u201d",
      "The country's infrastructure minister, Vladimir Svet, insisted \"we are decreasing the budget as much as possible, we\u2019ve rationalised the public procurement process and, if necessary, we'll take on a loan.\"",
      "\u201cIf we want to preserve our culture and feel secure about our freedom, there is no other way than being in a strong EU, Nato and international community that supports international law,\u201d he added.",

    "summary": "Dozens of videos involving a senior civil servant in Equatorial Guinea have flooded social media, shocking people in the country.",
    "story": [
      "What the rest of the world sees as a sex tape scandal could in fact be the latest episode in the real-life drama over who will become Equatorial Guinea\u2019s next president.",
      "Over the past fortnight, dozens of videos - estimates range from 150 to more than 400 - have been leaked of a senior civil servant having sex in his office and elsewhere with different women.",
      "They have flooded social media, shocking and titillating people in the small central African country and beyond.",
      "Many of the women filmed were wives and relatives of people close to the centre of power.",
      "It appears some were aware they were being filmed having sex with Baltasar Ebang Mr Engonga, who is also known as \u201cBello\u201d because of his good looks.",
      "All this is hard to verify as Equatorial Guinea is a highly restricted society where a free press does not exist.",
      "But one theory is that the leaks were a way to discredit the man at the centre of the storm.",
      "Mr Engonga is a nephew of President Teodoro Obiang Nguema and one of those thought to be hoping to replace him.",
      "Obiang is the world\u2019s longest-serving president having been in power since 1979.",
      "The 82-year-old has overseen an economic boom that has turned to bust as a result of the now-dwindling oil reserves.",
      "There is a small, extremely wealthy elite, but many of the 1.7 million people in the country live in poverty.",
      "Obiang\u2019s administration is heavily criticised for its human rights record, including arbitrary killings and torture, according to a US government report.",
      "It has also had its fair share of scandals - including the revelations about the lavish lifestyle of one of the president's sons, now vice-president, who once owned a $275,000 (\u00a3210,000) crystal-encrusted glove worn by Michael Jackson.",
      "Despite regular elections, there is no real opposition in Equatorial Guinea as activists have been jailed and exiled and those with designs on office are closely monitored.",
      "Politics in the country is really about palace intrigue and this is where the scandal involving Mr Engonga fits in.",
      "He was the head of the National Financial Investigation Agency, and worked on tackling crimes such as money laundering.",
      "But it turned out he himself was under investigation.",
      "He was arrested on 25 October accused of embezzling a huge sum of money from state coffers and depositing it in secret accounts in the Cayman Islands. He has not commented on the accusation.",
      "Mr Engonga was then taken to the infamous Black Beach prison in the capital, Malabo, where it is alleged that opponents of the government are subjected to brutal treatment.",
      "His phones and computers were seized and a few days later the intimate videos started appearing online.",
      "The first reference the BBC has found to them on Facebook is from 28 October on the page of Diario Rombe, a news site run by a journalist in exile in Spain, which said that \u201csocial networks exploded with the leaking of explicit images and videos\u201d.",
      "A post on X the following day referred to a \u201cmonumental scandal shaking the regime\u201d as \u201cpornographic videos flood social media\u201d.",
      "But they are believed to have originally appeared one-by-one a few days earlier on Telegram, on one of the platform's channels known for publishing pornographic images.",
      "They were then downloaded on to people\u2019s phones and shared among WhatsApp groups in Equatorial Guinea, where they caused a storm.",
      "Mr Engonga was quickly identified along with some of the women in the videos, including relatives of the president and wives to ministers and senior military officials.",
      "The government was unable to ignore what was going on and on 30 October Vice-President Teodoro Obiang Mangue (once owner of the Michael Jackson glove) gave telecoms companies 24 hours to come up with ways to stop the spread of the clips.",
      "\u201cWe cannot continue to watch families fall apart without taking any action,\u201d he wrote on X.",
      "\u201cIn the meantime, the origin of these publications is being investigated to find the author or authors and make them answer for their actions.\u201d",
      "As the computer equipment was in the hands of the security forces, suspicion has fallen on someone there, who, perhaps, sought to trash Mr Engonga\u2019s reputation ahead of a trial.",
      "The police have called on women to come forward to open a case against Mr Engonga for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. One has already announced that she is suing him.",
      "What is not clear is why Mr Engonga made the recordings.",
      "But activists have put forward what could be other motives behind the explosive leak.",
      "As well as being related to the president, Mr Engonga is the son of Baltasar Engonga Edjo'o, the head of the regional economic and monetary union, Cemac, and very influential in the country.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing is the end of an era, the end of the current president, and there is a succession [question] and this is the internal fighting we are seeing,\u201d said Equatoguinean activist Nsang Christia Esimi Cruz, now living in London.",
      "Speaking to the BBC Focus on Africa podcast, he alleged that Vice-President Obiang was trying to politically eliminate \u201canyone who could challenge his succession\u201d.",
      "The vice-president, along with his mother, are suspected to be pushing aside anyone who threatens his path to the presidency, including Gabriel Obiang Lima (another son of President Obiang from a different wife), who was oil minister for 10 years and then moved to a secondary government role.",
      "Those in the elite are thought to know things about each other that they would rather was not made public, and videos have been used in the past to humiliate and discredit a political opponent.",
      "There are also frequent accusations of coup plotting, which further fuels paranoia.",
      "But Mr Cruz also alleges that the authorities want to use the scandal as an excuse to crack down on social media, which is how a lot of information about what is really going on in the country gets out.",
      "In July, the authorities temporarily suspended the internet after protests broke out on the island of Annob\u00f3n.",
      "For him, the fact that a high-ranking official was having sex outside of marriage was not surprising as it was part of the decadent lifestyle of the country\u2019s elite.",
      "The vice-president, who himself has been convicted of corruption in France and has had lavish assets seized in various countries, wants to be seen as the man cracking down on graft and wrong-doing at home.",
      "Last year, for example, he ordered the arrest of his half-brother over allegations he sold a plane owned by the state airline.",
      "But in this case, despite the vice-president\u2019s efforts to stop the spread of the clips, they continue to be viewed.",
      "This week, he tried to appear more resolute calling for the installation of CCTV cameras in government offices \u201cto combat indecent and illicit acts\u201d, the official news agency reported.",
      "Saying that the scandal had \u201cdenigrated the image of the country\u201d he ordered that any officials found engaging in sex acts at work would be suspended as this was a \"flagrant violation of the code of conduct\u201d.",
      "He was not wrong that the story has attracted a lot of outside interest.",
      "Judging by Google's data, search enquiries that include the country\u2019s name have shot up since the beginning of this week.",
      "On Monday, on X, \u201cEquatorial Guinea\u201d was one of the top trending terms in Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa - surpassing at times interest in the US election.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:06:56 -0500",
    "summary": "The \"Cheers\" actor's new series is the Netflix comedy \"A Man on the Inside,\" in which he plays a retired widower-turned-investigator who goes undercover in a nursing home.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting down to talk about his new TV show, Ted Danson admits he is nervous. Why? \"Because I want people to see it, I really do,\" he said. \"I think it's an important conversation.\"",
      "It's strange to think of Danson as nervous about anything, but in this case, it's not hard to see why: his latest project means a lot to him, about a subject that touches everyone. In the new Netflix series \"A Man on the Inside,\" Danson is a recently-retired widower without much to do, until he answers an ad from a private investigator, and becomes a mole inside a nursing home.",
      "Like a lot of TV series, the premise seems a little far-fetched, but this one's true: it's based on \"The Mole Agent,\" a 2020 documentary about a real-life 83-year-old who goes undercover in a Chilean nursing home looking for signs of patients being mistreated. What the documentary found was a group of elderly people fighting loneliness and loss with heart and humor.",
      "\"A Man on the Inside\" is no different, says series creator Mike Schur. \"I would say the purpose of this show is simply to discuss a subject that very few people discuss, which is aging,\" said Schur. \"It's this subject that we just don't like to talk about. It's thought of in this country (I think more than other countries) as something almost shameful or embarrassing.\"",
      "\"If you're dying, you somehow made a mistake,\" said Danson.",
      "\"You screwed up! Yeah, you screwed up, you got old, you know?\" Schur said. \"And I think that's weird, because this is what happens if we're lucky. If we're lucky, we get old!\"",
      "At 76, Danson himself is aging gracefully, with an attitude inspired by a Hollywood legend: Jane Fonda. \"She was turning 80, and at 70 I was starting to go, 'Well, I'd better look for a nice place to land, you know, this life plane,' or whatever,\" he said. \"And I looked at her and it was like, no. She has her foot on the gas pedal! She's, like, doing a 12-hour day, shooting her show, jumping on a bus to go, you know, support the service industry in Sacramento with a handful of women.",
      "\"Don't slow down, just keep going, keep living your life. I think that's one of the things our elders can pass on to us. This is how you live life right up until the end.\"",
      "Seems like Danson's elders set a good example: his parents wouldn't allow a TV in their home. \"My mother didn't like them,\" he said. \"She'd rather you read, or go out and play, or be creative.\"",
      "But then, Danson got famous, on TV. \u00a0His parents finally got one. \"But they put kind of this beautiful tapestry over the front of it, so when you walked in their house, you didn't see a TV, you saw this beautiful tapestry with a candle on top, and they would take it off and watch 'Cheers,'\" he said.",
      "Danson still credits his success today to that one show about a Boston bar. But since he hung up his bartender apron in 1993, he's been in hit after hit. He was the title character in \"Becker.\" In \"Damages,\" he held his own with Glenn Close. He went to heaven and hell in \"The Good Place.\" And he's even played himself in \"Curb Your Enthusiasm.\"",
      "Along the way Danson has used his fame to draw attention to his passion project, Oceana, an organization dedicated to preserving the world's oceans. Asked if he feels they have made progress, he replied, \"Yes. I mean, our focus is fishing, over-fishing, making sure that the fisheries of the world are healthy. Because if done right, you could feed a billion people a fish meal every day.\"",
      "That sounds a little like a miracle \u2013 something he touches on in his new show, and something he says he lives with every day.",
      "Asked what are the miracles in his life, Danson replied, \"Mary Steenburgen is, you know, literally heaven-sent. I did some work on myself for about a year before I met her, after 'Cheers,' becoming emotionally mature and real. And I worked hard at it. And then along came Mary Steenburgen. \u2026 We are so blessed. To love somebody and to be loved, is just one of those heaven-on-earth miracles, you know? And that came with Mary.\"",
      "And the idea Ted Danson is hoping to share with his latest project is that miracles can be found in any life, right up until the very end. \"This is your life,\" he said, \"not just up to, you know, 65 and then you retire and are going down. No, you get to live right up until you don't live. And it's your life. It's such a gift. Explore it, and be excited about it. Yes, it hurts. Yes, it's sad. Yes, there's grief. Yes, there's all of that. But embrace it. Embrace it, is kind of what I think the message of the show is. It's what I hope I live with.\"",
      "He got emotional sharing that. \"I'm just emotional 'cause I finally said something I wanted to say!\" he laughed.",

    "story": [
      "T Bone Burnett is best known as a music producer, but in April, he released \"The Other Side,\" his first album of new music in 18 years. Asked why he releases his own music so infrequently, Burnett replied, \"I've always been a behind-the-scenes person. I like creating in private.\"",
      "Maybe even more remarkable, this fall, he's touring behind it.",
      "He was quoted earlier this year saying he always viewed the audience as a mob coming to get him. \"Yeah, like a lynch mob or something,\" he laughed. \"It was just raw paranoia, but also just insecurity.\"",
      "Burnett is more at home in the studio, where he's produced albums for The Wallflowers, Greg Allman, and Elton John.",
      "Asked what he thinks he can get out of musicians that maybe other people don't, Burnett said, \"Well, what I try to get out of them is just their full love, their full being.\"",
      "He certainly did with Robert Plant and Alison Krauss on \"Raising Sand,\" and won the Grammy for album of the year in 2009:",

In 2021, they played together again, re-recording Dylan's classic, \"Blowin' in the Wind,\" using a special high fidelity analog system that Burnett says creates the highest quality audio ever.",
      "\"We decided to just make one disc; there are no copies,\" he said. \"The germ of it was, I wanted to do something that couldn't be put online. It couldn't be commoditized. I'm not doing this to keep it away from anybody. I'm just doing it to work at the highest possible level.\"\u00a0The disc sold at auction in 2022 for nearly $1.8 million.",

      "\"It's a mystical kind of thing,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Yeah, it is to me. And you build a world of resonance, and that's the stuff that's the most thrilling to me, and the part of life that a machine will never comprehend.\"",
      "T Bone Burnett's new record earned a Grammy nomination this past week for best Americana album, and at 76, he's even starting to enjoy another sound \u2026 the sound of a crowd. \"I think I had a much more benevolent view of the audience than I used to have,\" he said.",

      "Yellowstone fans feel a deep connection to Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, the couple at the heart of the show's success. As the series approaches its end, Kelly Reilly, who plays Beth, addressed speculation about their future during an appearance Friday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "When asked about a potential spin-off featuring Beth and Rip, Reilly responded with an enthusiastic, \"Yes, please.\" She added, however, that her focus remains on bringing Beth's story to a powerful close in the main series.",
      "Reilly's portrayal of Beth \u2014 the only daughter of patriarch\u00a0John Dutton, played by\u00a0Kevin Costner\u00a0\u2014has become iconic for her fierce loyalty, deep love and unpredictable nature. In season five, Beth is locked in a bitter conflict with her brother Jamie, whose manipulative schemes threaten to tear their family apart. Reilly said Beth's intensity comes from a painful past.",
      "\"She's not just one thing. She's like 10 women in one,\" Reilly said. \"There's an incredible depth of heart and love and devotion for her family.\"",
      "Despite Beth's wild behavior, Reilly says she feels a profound sympathy for her.",
      "\"She breaks my heart,\" Reilly said. \"I think over the years, over the seasons, you're able to sort of unpeel the layers and get to see why she does some of the things she does.\"",
      "Beth's difficult past includes growing up on a rugged ranch with her brothers and a tragic accident where a horse bucked, fell on her mother and killed her. Beth's mother blamed her for the incident before dying, a moment that scarred Beth.",
      "One of Beth's few sources of happiness is her relationship with Rip Wheeler, played by Cole Hauser. Their love story has resonated so deeply with fans that they even dress up as Beth and Rip for Halloween. Reilly described the relationship as deeply protective.",
      "\"They're both savages ... but they are so fiercely protective of one another,\" Reilly said.",
      "Reilly, who is British, also discussed her process of capturing Beth's American accent with the help of a dialect coach.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've played American...and I'm married to an American, I live in New York,\" she said.",

      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",

      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases.

    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",

      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",

      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",

      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",
      "The Consumer Healthcare Products Association said Thursday it was \"disappointed\" in the FDA's proposal. The industry trade group renewed its claim that no changes \"are warranted\" for oral phenylephrine and cited previous FDA and advisory committee decisions that did not call for pulling the ingredient.",
      "\"PE should remain an available option for consumers, because Americans deserve the option to choose the safe and effective OTC medicines they prefer and rely on,\" Scott Melville, CHPA's president and CEO, said in a statement.",
      "After the FDA's advisory committee last year, pharmacy chain\u00a0CVS said it would pull\u00a0any products on its shelves that only contained the product.",
      "Spokespeople for drugmakers behind the brands did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The FDA's proposal caps a push by pharmacy professors at the University of Florida who have urged the agency for years to pull the product, pointing to new data showing phenylephrine did no better than a placebo when swallowed.",
      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",
      "The researchers also have questioned the initial studies that were run to prove the drug's effectiveness, though they acknowledge that it is safe at currently approved levels.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "When asked if he'd step down if Trump requested it, Powell responded with a one-word answer: \"No.\"",
      "Powell's insistence that he'll remain in his role comes after Trump aired grievances about the Fed's decision-making during his first presidency and, more recently, on the campaign trial. Trump, who has accused Powell of being \"political,\" also told Bloomberg Businessweek this summer he would let the economist serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Yet Trump has also said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",

      "Powell also noted that the election in the near-term will have no impact on the central bank's rate decisions, with the Fed instead relying on economic data for its decisions. For now, he added, it's not clear what policies or tax changes may emerge from a second Trump presidency.",
      "Many of Trump's proposals, such as tax cuts, must be passed by Congress before being signed into law by the president.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",

      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",

      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's vow to raise tariffs could have Americans paying more for goods, from toys to auto parts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

      "The company's third-quarter results, disclosed in a U.S. Securities & Exchange filing, shows that the fledgling social media business continues to lose money, while its revenue slipped 5.6% compared with a year earlier. Still, that marks an improvement from the prior quarter, when Trump Media's sales tumbled 30%.",
      "Donald Trump's stake in DJT",
      "DJT stock has been on a rollercoaster since going public in March, with the shares surging or falling in line with news about Trump, its largest shareholder, with about 57% of the company's shares. The erratic fluctuations of the shares have prompted comparisons with so-called meme stocks, which trade on social media buzz rather than the fundamentals that investors prefer, such as revenue and profitability growth.",

      "The shares have been on a wild ride since going public in March, initially surging and giving former president's 57% stake a value of\u00a0$5.2 billion.

    "story": [
      "If history is any guide, one stock market gauge suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",
      "\"Is this really statistically significant? I think the answer is no, but it makes for interesting copy,\" the strategist said. \"You can have data tell whatever story you want.\"",

If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",

      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",
      "\"I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue,\" Khanna said.",
      "In Michigan, Harris lost key support in Arab American areas amid Israel's war in Gaza. Khanna said he believes that Harris would have won Michigan \"if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza.\" He added that he has seen that even \"beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.\"",
      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",
      "Khanna said Harris' was a \"winnable campaign,\" adding that \"anyone who is saying now 'this was not a winnable campaign' didn't say that back in August.\"",
      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: What's next for America after former President Trump's decisive victory? With Donald Trump and his allies now focused on their agenda for Washington and the world, how and will he deliver on his campaign promises?",
      "We will begin with Republican Senator Bill Hagerty. He served in Trump's first term as ambassador to Japan. Will he return for a bigger role in the second?",
      "National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will be here to discuss President Biden's national security priorities, as the clock ticks down on the commander in chief.",
      "Plus: After Democrats lost support from key voter groups, the party faces an identity crisis and the process of rebuilding. California Congressman Ro Khanna will weigh in on the challenges ahead.",
      "British Ambassador to the U.S. Dame Karen Pierce will be here to talk about the European reaction to Trump's return. And we will check in with Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari about the Fed's interest rate cut and the incoming administration's ambitious plans to reshape the economy.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "As we wrap up campaign 2024, the scope of Republican control in Washington over the next few years is coming into focus. Overnight, CBS projected Donald Trump the winner in Arizona, giving him a complete electoral vote sweep of the seven battleground states.",
      "With a final tally of 312 electoral votes, Republicans scored their biggest White House win in 36 years. Republicans will also control the Senate with at least 52 seats, and there are two races that have not yet been called by CBS News. Control of the House is still to be determined with a few contests outstanding, but CBS News rates it as leaning Republican at this point.",
      "We begin this morning with what we have learned about the incoming Trump administration, personnel, priorities, and more.",
      "We turn now to Robert Costa.",
      "Bob, good to have you here.",
      "I know you have been speaking to your sources. What will the second term look like?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: Great to be with you, Margaret.",
      "In recent days, I have spoken to president-elect Trump, called him up on the phone, along with his top advisers and allies. And what's notable about this transition is that, unlike in 2016, when he was elected as a Washington outsider, now he knows all the players in Washington.",
      "And he alone, more than any other aid, is evaluating the personnel and possibilities around him. And he reflected in one of our conversations about how he sees his mandate, that he has a movement and a base and now a party that's fully behind him. And he wants to make sure that anyone who comes on board has his same vision for that mandate and for his perceived level of support.",
      "And you have seen in recent days people around Trump in the wider orbit are trying to recommend a lot of names, but it's Trump himself who's saying to his top aides like Susie Wiles, his incoming chief of staff, that he wants to make sure that this is not a chaotic process and it's reflective of where he wants to go, more than any other kind of counsel.",
      "And on foreign policy, for example, you see names like Senator Bill Hagerty, Senator Marco Rubio, former Ambassador Ric Grenell, all people who identify with Trump's vision. But those who have had issues with Trump in the past about how he perceives foreign policy, like, for example, former Ambassador Nikki Haley or former Secretary Mike Pompeo, are now out of the process.",
      "And it's not because of any personal trouble with Trump, I'm told. It's because, at the end of the day, Trump wants to make sure things are moving along smoothly on ideological and policy lines come January.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do we know what it was with Mike Pompeo, who served him quite loyally for four years as CIA director and secretary of state? Was it his support, for example, of Ukraine?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: It's just a different orbit around Trump right now. The president-elect has people like Donald Trump Jr., Elon Musk. He has Steve Bannon on the outside advising him.",
      "These are people who are noninterventionists. These are people who aren't traditional Republican hawks. That's not to say some hawks won't end up in this administration or some Wall Street figures might end up in this administration as well.",
      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob Costa, thank you.",
      "And we turn now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Japan.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY (R-Tennessee): Yes, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 during the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",
      "We were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: The Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Nothing to the level that we've seen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.",
      "But, on the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe \u2013 you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 except for the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids, and you have new voices Congress, people like Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that could unify our party, moderates and progressives. And it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, white working class voters, and we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening to hear from so many Democrats now, who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement \"woke\" politics really was incredibly damaging to the left, because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in, of which you are a member.",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues, but I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation. The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing, I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley, while towns like Johnstown were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Biden -President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district. Since you just mentioned it, Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election, you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk, significantly. And JD Vance, the vice-presidential candidate. He really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign. What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it, is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70% of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 Yes",
      "REP. KHANNA: But you're right that we had a slippage and probably now 20-30% support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto. But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I've reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley, and we can be the party that helps AI robotics, build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country. When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told The New York Times there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible. Do you agree with her?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled when people have said this about President Biden, because the day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory. I think this was a winnable campaign. Even when he got out, Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now, this was not a winnable campaign, didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground, people like Chris Deluzio, Pat Ryan, who were saying, talk about the economy, talk about people's economic struggles. Have- convince people you have the better policies and better vision. The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance. We actually- you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris, and on this program, you defended both. Many times, one place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said, when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims. You heard there was a problem here. Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REP. RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. That wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground. I also think beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives. Now my hope is because President Trump got some of the votes for the Muslim and Arab community. I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia. They have said that if the President wants a deal with Saudi Arabia, that the Palestinian state and a two state solution has to be front and center. And I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna, Congressman, thank you very much for your time today. We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who also served as US Ambassador to Japan\u2013",
      "SEN. BILL HAGERTY: \u2013Yes Margaret",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: During the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine, I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation. You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I've been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid. I've been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first. And I've taken a lot of heat over it, from Mitch McConnell from the Wall Street Journal, but this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013there's no U.S. presence in Ukraine",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion. That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here, and with the borders collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first. But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60 a barrel cap. The argument they make that reduces Russia's profits. What it does actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again, unfairly against us, with an energy cost advantage. And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out. Interestingly, interestingly, I'll call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the EU say, \"Maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well that's been talked about for some time--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: We're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around. The UK has said we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5% all since President Trump was elected",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was- was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine. So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I've certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that the mandate?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY:\u00a0 And I think President Trump will find- President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage. Look what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying. They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment, you have Chinese equipment\u2013",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: -- Deeply concerning, yes--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield. So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chess board?",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 on Russia whether or not they're--",
      "SEN. HAGARTY: Iran we had them shut down. Iran was broke, whether or not they're now they're able to fund terror all over the world, we had a maximum pressure \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China \u2013",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign. President Trump led this. We're able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did the Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror. As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Nothing to the level that we've seen here--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, but on the Middle East.\u00a0 Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: No, and if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department- the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The UN says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine. If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Well I've had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law, it's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70 plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe- you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'd like to see what, I'd like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah--",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: -- Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to, again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength. I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters, certainly in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that. Do you think- and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause. To borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration. He's going to focus on Iran because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 but in terms of \u2014",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: \u2014 Except for the fact that they released- the enforcement of sanctions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 Upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of US military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling US troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a business person negotiates. Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War. A significant investment on behalf of the American people. Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries today. They are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant, and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss within the level of support--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2014 But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible. To strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan, they've agreed to double their defense budget from 1% to 2% of GDP. That's a positive development. They're trying to work more closely with us. I think in President Trump's administration, they definitely will. This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go. You are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his cabinet if asked?",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: I'll just say this, I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas. It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee, serving the United States Senate. In whatever role I hold going- going forward, it's going to be advanced. It's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated, that the American people overwhelmingly supported, and I'll do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Neel Kashkari, Minneapolis Federal Reserve president, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President, Neel Kashkari, he joins us now. Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Good morning. Margaret,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seems to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here. Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are- show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1% so right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5% or so, so we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job, but so far so good. I mean, I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job, but we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. It sounds like you're expecting another rate cut.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2% target. So if you look at the what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out. The expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions, and that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible. But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market that's going to that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical but we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations. When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation, you said, in some ways, it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time, you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods. How long before we would see the economic impact of, say, a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question. Margaret, I mean, I think if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what you know, how they would adjust to that, and how, how long it would take, and how disruptive it would be. I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainty about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We at the Fed will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the President Elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add 8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well if you look over the long term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably, so at some point, those have to be addressed, and that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2% inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that, but you're right. Over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed, but that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5% increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by one to two percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one time tariff, so if somebody imposed a 1% tariff or a 10% tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1% or 10%. That's pretty easy to model, and it shouldn't have an effect long run on inflation. The challenge becomes, if there's a tit for tat. And it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses, and it's escalating, that's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain. So I think again, with, as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented, and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to businesses and labor unions all around my region, it's one of cautious optimism that the economy is doing well. There are jobs available, and we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2% and so right now, I would say we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing, and our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked, he made clear he does not think that the law would require that, and in fact, it would violate the law. But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2% inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making, and that will continue to do so. And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So the governors at the Board of Governors in Washington serve up to 14 year terms. The presidents of the Reserve Banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity between that and I think, bipartisan support that we all want to get inflation back down to 2% and we want to keep the economy strong. I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and President elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday. There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years. And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues. Including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the President will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these- these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now. We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all-in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground, or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last two and a half years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table. And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --And President Biden made clear when President Zelensky was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full. Meaning that by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized. And of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe. And ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, If we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos. What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine in the most dramatic and full throated way one could- could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia. We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty was saying it's- Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting, they have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine- for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong Un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure, and frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going forward basis. But I will tell you this, Kim Jong Un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or ten years ago. So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea, in both directions, is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog is coming to the White House. That was just announced. What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and he'll speak to his decisions. Here's what I see. First in Gaza, it really, today, is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what--",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: --Hamas has said no",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made. What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is no, we will not do a cease fire and hostage deal at this time. So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table, to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction. And then when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government. Those should remain behind closed doors, but we do believe that at some point the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel, and I expect that in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account? Because the Secretaries of State and Defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: So basically what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says, here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps. This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the President will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the President confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as 'Salt Typhoon?'",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber-enabled espionage, about cyber attacks--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way. And of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us. We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Karen Pierce, British ambassador to the U.S., on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 10, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the UK's ambassador to the United States. Welcome back to Face The Nation.",
      "AMBASSADOR DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much. Margaret, nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ambassador, after this election, there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's Prime Minister said, \"Don't ask what the US can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\" What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine, I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has- has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all-in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen, and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful, Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the US, and it certainly emboldens China, and I don't think anyone in the US wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on Friday, Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally. He's friends with Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, he said \"The situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine. Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration's plans are. But certainly I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting--",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: -- We speak to Donald Trump, the Prime Minister spoke to him very recently, on the Wednesday after- the day after the election. In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons, and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10% across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the UK may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so. As- as the UK, you know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach from many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments are hugely important part of what we do with America, something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment and trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda, and we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current UK Government is a different one, of course, from that period of time with the Labor Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote \"Trump is not only a woman hating neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\" Are you concerned that those past statements and the ideological differences will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the Vice President-Elect, have also said critical things about President Trump. In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the Prime Minister Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues. You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I wouldn't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological, and I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: One of the UK politicians who was at Mar-a-Lago and celebrating on election night was Nigel Farage. He's known for his anti-immigrant stance. There has been, not just in the US, but also in Europe, around the world, this backlash against immigrants and migration, and that has really impacted a lot of politics here. I'm wondering what your thoughts are, more broadly, about what kind of political force and factor that is in the world we're in now? It's a big question, but it does seem like there's something global happening.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I'd agree with you, Margaret, there's something very important for a lot of electorates 'round the world about the subject of immigration. But I don't want to give the impression that in the west or in the UK we are not generous to people in need. We took a lot of Syrians, a lot of Afghans, a lot of Ukrainians. Economic migration is the thing we're all very worried about. And although the problem manifests itself differently in the UK from in the US, I think you're right. It is something that voters care about. It is something that the British Government is committed to tackling. The Prime Minister is very interested in how you act against the criminal gangs who foster this sort of migration, and actually are the ones exploiting people who come across in small boats or whatever conveyance they use. It's about stopping the gangs and stopping the traffickers, and we'll need a lot of international coordination to make that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador Pierce, thank you for your time today.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Thank you very much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "President-elect Donald Trump's decisive victory is, to say the least, a turning point in the American story.",
      "For Trump and his 74 million supporters, it's a dramatic comeback \u2013 a rebuke of an establishment many of them detest, and an affirmation of his agenda, which includes the mass deportations of undocumented migrants; sweeping tariffs; and deregulating federal agencies, as favored by campaign benefactors like Elon Musk.",
      "But for those who backed Vice President Kamala Harris, it is a crushing loss to a man who attempted to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "In her concession speech, Harris said, \"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results \u2026. At the same time, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States.\"",
      "This week, President Joe Biden and Trump are scheduled to meet in the Oval Office.",
      "\"It's a pivotal moment to see Trump return to office,\" said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. \"The simplest story we have right now \u2013 which may be the correct one \u2013 is that there was a kind of incumbent backlash against the Biden administration and against the Democratic Party. And Kamala Harris couldn't separate herself from it.\"",
      "Nyhan says Trump's victory is part of a broader trend \u2013 a rejection of incumbents: \"Around the world, the parties that have held power during COVID performed very poorly at the polls. It may just be very difficult to hold power after a bout of inflation. Everyone feels inflation. It's not the same as unemployment, where it's only a subset of folks who are directly affected.",
      "\"What's striking, though, about this situation is that by many, not all, objective measures, the American economy has recovered quite well, in some ways better than many of our counterparts,\" Nyhan said.",
      "Of course, the election was about more than the economy. According to professor Dianne Pinderhughes, a political scientist at the University of Notre Dame, race, gender, and class were all factors in this election.",

      "After Harris entered the race this summer for a dash to the finish, Democrats were hopeful she could finally break that glass ceiling.",
      "Is that promise of a female president still there? \"I think a lot of people feel that it's not there,\" Pinderhughes said, \"that we have a long way to go, given the contest between two candidates where one is a convicted felon.",
      "\"The fact that people that look at those two candidates and see a credible possibility of Donald Trump being president again was just hard to process,\" she said.",
      "For now, Trump is working to staff his cabinet and inner circle. A top campaign advisor, Susie Wiles, will become the first female White House chief of staff. And, unlike in 2016, when he was an outsider, Trump returns as leader of a party that has remade itself in his image.",
      "Nyhan said, \"He has transformed the Republican Party permanently. And I think the people who hoped that they could just go back to the way things were will finally and fully have to admit defeat.",
      "\"People vote on policy; people vote on party; and they vote on the state of the country,\" Nyhan said. \"In some ways, that's good. But it means we're vulnerable when conditions are unfavorable. And that's brought Donald Trump back from the political dead.\"",

      "Kamala Harris made an appeal to Republicans, particularly Republican women, often on the issue of abortion rights, but few voted for her. A third of Republican women in Nevada voted \"yes\" on the right to abortion, but Harris had just single-digit support from these voters.",

But in Cleveland's hometown, locals still want to preserve his legacy.",

Now, his birthplace is across the street from a gas station and donut shop, and it remains a tour site \u2014 though some days, no one comes to visit, according to tour guide Sharon Farrell.",

During the middle of his life, he was a lawyer in Buffalo, New York, living in a small apartment above his law practice, according to author Troy Senik, who wrote \"A Man of Iron,\" a biography chronicling Cleveland's life. Later, he would be the mayor of Buffalo and the governor of New York.",

      "\"If you're looking at the late 19th century, if you're looking at the Gilded Age, the debates are about tariffs. They're about silver in the money supply. They're about pensions for union veterans. We don't know how to think about any of these things,\" Senik said. \"It's not exciting stuff.\"",
      "Cleveland lost his re-election race to Indiana Republican Benjamin Harrison in 1888, though he won the popular vote. He was initially content with his retirement and \"somewhat relieved,\" feeling that \"he had done a decent job in his first term,\" according to Senik.",
      "But in 1892, he was again pressured by party leaders to run. He narrowly vanquished Harrison and moved back into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue \u2014 something his wife, who he married during his first term, always believed would happen.",
      "In the final days of Cleveland's first term, Frances Folsom told \"a member of the domestic staff in the White House 'Make sure that you pack up everything very carefully because we want it to be just where we remember it when we come back,'\" according to Senik.",

      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters.

      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:46:00 -0500",
    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn is holding off on enforcing his ruling for 30 days to allow Illinois leaders time to appeal.",
    "story": [
      "CHICAGO (CBS) --\u00a0A federal judge in downstate Illinois has ruled the state's ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional, but will hold off on prohibiting the state from enforcing it for one month to allow for a likely appeal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn, who sits on the federal court in East Saint Louis, wrote in his 168-page opinion that the statewide ban on assault-style weapons violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The Protect Illinois Communities Act\u00a0bans the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requires existing owners of those weapons to register them with Illinois State Police.",
      "The legislation, signed into law in January 2023, banned dozens of specific brands or types of rifles and handguns, .50-caliber guns, attachments and rapid-firing devices. No rifle will be allowed to accommodate more than 10 rounds, with a 15-round limit for handguns.",
      "As part of his ruling that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, McGlynn issued a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ban, but he stayed that injunction for 30 days to give the state time to file an appeal.",
      "Gun control laws have come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the\u00a0Supreme Court's June 2022 decision\u00a0that imposed a new framework for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions. In that ruling, the court said that for firearms laws to comply with the Second Amendment, the government must identify historical analogues that show the measure is consistent with the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "McGlynn sided with plaintiffs who argued the Illinois assault weapons ban does not fit within the Supreme Court's framework, and who argued that assault weapons are commonly used for self-defense.",
      "\"What is particularly disturbing is that the prohibition of weapons that are commonly owned and used by citizens are now banned, depriving citizens of a principal means to defend themselves and their property in situations where a handgun or shotgun alone would not be the citizen's preferred arm,\" McGlynn wrote. \"Sadly, there are those who seek to usher in a sort of post-Constitution era where the citizens' individual rights are only as important as they are convenient to a ruling class.\"",
      "McGlynn compared the use of firearms for self-defense to equipping vehicles with airbags, ocean liners with lifeboats, or houses with storm shelters.",
      "\"Why do we protect ourselves with firearms? In life, we face many perils,\" He wrote. \"Too often, the perils we face are forced upon us by other people. By people who are negligent, reckless, insane, impaired, or evil. Sometimes it is the proverbial lone wolf; sometimes, it is the whole wolf pack. Truly, life comes at you quickly. And who comes to our aid in times of peril? Sometimes, it is the police or first responders; other times it is healthcare professionals; and sometimes it is family, friends, or neighbors. Sometimes, it is no one.\"",
      "Before the case went to trial earlier this year, McGlynn issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Illinois from enforcing the assault weapons ban, but a federal appeals court later reversed that decision. In July, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, sending it back to McGlynn for a trial, which was held in September.",
      "Meanwhile, a case against an assault weapons ban in Maryland has been upped to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court takes the Maryland case, it could take the Illinois case\u2014or send it back to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Two similar lawsuits are pending in federal court in Chicago.",
      "Gun rights and gun control advocates react",
      "Dan Eldridge was one of the plaintiffs who argued that assault-style weapons banned under Illinois law are commonly used for self-defense purposes.",
      "\"Illinois does not want to be the test case that shows all of these state so-called assault weapon bans are unconstitutional,\" said Dan Eldridge, president of Firearm Licensees of Illinois.",
      "Eldridge said the judge simply decided the Illinois law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\"This trial was on the merits of the case, and he found in our favor, and found that PICA's 'assault weapon' ban is unconstitutional under the 2nd and 14th amendments,\" he said.",
      "Rachel Jacoby of Highland Park was in Springfield on Jan. 10, 2023\u2014the day Gov. JB Pritzker signed the ban int law\u2014representing her community. It was July 4, 2022, when a man with a high-powered rifle opened fire on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park and killed seven people.",
      "\"This ruling is a slap in the face to every single person in Illinois who's been affected by gun violence, because those of us who have been personally affected by gun violence know the pain and trauma that comes from experiencing this,\" Jacoby said, \"and this judge's ruling is callous and unfounded in my opinion.\"",
      "Although the State of Illinois has already appealed the ruling, Eldridge said he hopes the plaintiffs are fortunate enough to win.",
      "\"And everything goes back to how it was on January 9 of 2023,\" Eldridge said.",
      "Jacoby hopes the ban stays in place, because regular people should not be able to access assault-style weapons.",
      "\"We know firsthand the devastation and trauma that these assault weapons can cause our communities, and we want to make sure that no other community has to experience that pain, that carnage, and that horror that we experienced,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said:",
      "\"The Protect Illinois Communities Act was the result of hundreds of hours of deliberation between legal experts, legislators, and advocates, and it makes Illinois a safer place for everyone. Despite those who value weapons of war more than public safety, this law was enacted to and has protected Illinoisans from the constant fear of being gunned down in places where they ought to feel secure. We look forward to the Attorney General filing an immediate appeal and the Governor is confident the constitutionality of the Protect Illinois Communities Act will be upheld through this process.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:50:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",
      "The scrolls were found in a villa thought to be previously owned by Julius Caesar's patrician father-in-law, whose mostly unexcavated property held a library that could contain thousands more manuscripts.",

    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters.

And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",

      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

      "The young family traveled from southern Mexico to the House of Mercy and All Nations shelter in the northern Mexican border city of Nogales, joining other migrants from across Latin America. Half of them are children. All of them have one objective: finding work and safety in the U.S.",
      "Castro Santos, 22, said he and his wife, Fatima Gonzalez Hernandez, 19, decided to leave Guerrero, Mexico, because of \"the crime and the risk to the children\" there. \"To protect them,\" he added in Spanish, looking at his young children.",

The system was established by the Biden administration to dissuade migrants from crossing the border illegally, but many are now worried that President-elect Donald Trump will make it much harder for them to make it into the U.S. at all.",
      "Castro Santos said he's worried about Trump \"canceling the appointments\" offered by the U.S. government app, known as CBP One. \"We don't want to run that risk of going back and putting them at risk,\" he said, referring to his children. If allowed into the U.S., he said his family would like to settle in Houston, where his sister lives. He said he would like to learn how to cook and work in a restaurant.",
      "Trump made tackling illegal immigration a central theme of his campaign, running on a platform of mass deportations, harsher asylum rules and a reversal of the Biden administration's border policies, including the app-powered entry system used by migrants in Mexico. His immigration promises appealed to many American voters, polls show, including those living near the southern border.",
      "Anna Parada, who was born and raised in Nogales, Arizona, just miles away from the border with Mexico, said the \"main\" reason she voted for Trump was because of his stance on immigration.",

      "U.S. officials worry that Trump's election will end the months-long lull in illegal border crossings, which plunged this year following an aggressive effort by Mexican officials to interdict migrants and President Biden's move in June to make most of those crossing into the country illegally ineligible for asylum. Larger numbers of migrants, officials have said, could be incentivized to cross into the U.S. unlawfully in the coming weeks, before Trump takes office on Jan. 20.",

      "Rep. Ro Khanna said Democrats \"need to be emphasizing the economic issues\" in the wake of the 2024 election, which delivered bruising blows to the party \u2014 and prompted a reckoning on the path forward.",
      "\"We did not have a compelling enough economic vision,\" Khanna, a California Democrat, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris last week, as the Democrats lost support from key demographic groups from the 2020 election. Khanna, a member of the party's progressive wing, attributed the fracturing among the Democratic coalition to the shortcomings in the party's economic message.",
      "\"The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans,\" Khanna said. \"Not just working-class Americans \u2014 a large slice of Americans who feel the American Dream has slipped away for their families and their kids.\"",
      "Khanna said new voices in Congress, like Reps. Pat Ryan, Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Chris Deluzio, have encouraged that Democrats need to tell a \"better economic story,\" emphasizing a vision of raising the minimum wage, addressing child care and building new factories.",
      "\"I think that can unify our party \u2014 moderates and progressives \u2014 and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, Black voters, White working class voters,\" Khanna said. \"And we have a better vision than Donald Trump on that.\"",
      "In the days since the election, some Democrats have expressed that the economic message should have been front and center in the campaign, while arguing that the party had a focus on identity politics. But Khanna said that while he's been clear on the importance of economic issues, \"I don't think we should run away\" from issues like standing up for transgender rights and equal rights.",
      "Khanna urged Democrats not to \"shy away from your convictions,\" adding that with the issues, along with a focus on the economy, the party can still be successful.",

      "Amid the hand wringing over the election, Democrats have also pointed to President Biden's late decision to leave the race and endorse Harris, including former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Khanna said while he has a \"lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi,\" he's \"chuckled\" at the idea.",
      "\"The day he got out, we had Democrats with the most over-the-top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing,\" Khanna said. \"So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.\"",

      "\"The reason we didn't win, ultimately, is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground\" on emphasizing economic issues, Khanna said. \"The reason I'm hopeful for the future is we have the substance.\"",

      "I'm told by my sources that the president-elect is not ruling out mainstream Republicans or more centrist Republicans from joining his team. But, at this point, he's moving quickly to make sure his base, his party, and his image is reflected in the personnel picks fully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What are his priorities for the 1st 100 days? Or is that too traditional a way of thinking about it?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: No, they have a real agenda this time. You remember, in 2017, it was somewhat sporadic in how they moved and navigated on health care and taxes.",
      "They are moving quickly already behind the scenes to expand the Trump tax cuts, to institute sweeping tariffs across the board. They're also going to try to, on foreign policy, begin negotiations with Ukraine and Russia sometime early next year. And you have mass deportations, more than anything, galvanizing the Trump people behind the scenes.",
      "Of course, they know it's going to be controversial. To remove undocumented migrants in a big way across the country could be logistically difficult and politically challenging, but they're moving ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Bob Costa, thank you.",
      "And we turn now to Tennessee Republican Senator Bill Hagerty, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Japan.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY (R-Tennessee): Yes, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 during the first Trump administration. It's good to have you here.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Donald Trump has this sweeping mandate, as do Republicans. Do you see this as an unrestrained presidency?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Oh, I think this is a presidency that has a mandate like we haven't seen, as you mentioned, in 36 years. The American public has spoken loud and clear. And",
      "I think if you go back to your interview with Bob, there are a number of places where Washington has been out of touch with the American people. You mentioned Ukraine. I think that's a great example. The American people want sovereignty protected here in America before we spend our funds and resources protecting the sovereignty of another nation.",
      "You think about it, we've sent $175 billion of U.S. aid to Ukraine. That's more than three times the entire annual budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. I have been one of the few senators in the United States Senate who has voted and has opposed every cent of this Ukraine aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have been listening to the American people. We need to focus on our own issues first.",
      "And I have taken a lot of heat over it from Mitch McConnell, from \"The Wall Street Journal.\"",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: But this is what the American people spoke up and want us to do. We should never have been in Ukraine. It's a result of failed policies, failed energy policies, the failure in Afghanistan.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's no U.S. presence in Ukraine. Are you talking about\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No, but our funds. I'm talking about the vast amount of funds, again, $175 billion.",
      "That's a tremendous amount, as I said, more than three times the budget of the U.S. Marine Corps. The American people want to focus on fixing our problems here. And with the border's collapse, with crime in the cities, we've got to pay attention to America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So does that mean just cuts to U.S. military aid to all countries?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: What it means is that we need to take a very deliberate focus on America first.",
      "But we need to be leading from a position of strength, Margaret. As I said, we would not be in this position. Now what we have is an administration that's allowing Russia to sell at a $60-a-barrel cap. The argument they make, that reduces Russia's profits.",
      "What it does, actually, is it subsidizes China to compete again unfairly against us with an energy cost advantage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And we keep Vladimir Putin fully funding this war in Ukraine. We need to stop that. We need to go back to producing our own energy and take Russia out.",
      "Interestingly, interestingly, I will call this the Trump effect. But just in the past 72 hours, what we've seen is the E.U. say, maybe we should replace Russian LNG with U.S. LNG. You've seen in New York City\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that \u2013 that's been talked about for some time.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 we're not going to issue debit cards to illegal immigrants anymore. Migrant caravans are being broken up below the border and turned around.",
      "The U.K. has said, we're going to step our defense budget up to about 2.5 percent, all since President Trump was elected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Some of that was \u2013 was in process already, but let me ask you specifically on Ukraine.",
      "So Hungary's Prime Minister has said that Donald Trump has told him he will cut off support to Ukraine. You are saying here, I think, in the new Congress, there will be no more aid to Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I have certainly not voted for any aid.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know you haven't, but is that \u2013 is that the mandate?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I think President Trump will find \u2013 President Trump will find a way to deal with this. I'm not going to get ahead of him. I'm certain that he's going to find a way to navigate this that's in the interest of the American people and will stop the carnage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, but\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Look, what's happened in Ukraine is terrible. People are dying.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They continue to die. But we need to stop this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But \u2013 but here's the thing, we also are seeing this alignment of like an axis of adversaries, right? You have Iranian equipment. You have Chinese equipment.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Deeply concerning, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. You have North Korean personnel on the battlefield.",
      "So this idea that Ukraine is somehow divorced from the rest of geopolitics doesn't seem to be bearing out. It's of deep concern to some of our Asian allies, Japan, South Korea. So how are you going to be able to do this without complicating the chessboard?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I think it's become complicated because America has not been standing in a position of strength. The reason is that Russia has been fully funded because of the policies that allow them to sell energy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are extensive sanctions on Russia, whether or not they're\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Iran, we had them shut down. Iran was broke. Now they're able to fund terror all over the world. We had a maximum pressure campaign.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In part because they have all these other adversaries that they're doing business with, right? China.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They were not able to do that under the Trump administration. That's why we saw peace breaking out in the Middle East. Without Iran being shut down, which is what we did under the maximum pressure campaign \u2013 President Trump led this.",
      "We were able to move our embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Everybody said it couldn't happen. It did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: The Abraham Accords. Peace was breaking out in the Middle East because Iran could not fund terror.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: As soon as the Biden administration came in, they stopped enforcing\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There were attacks by Iran during the Trump administration.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Nothing to the level that we've seen here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the assassination of Qasem Soleimani.",
      "But, on the Middle East. Israel's Prime Minister said this morning that he spoke to President Trump three times in recent days, and they discussed Iran and they discussed a peace plan. Do you know what the content of those conversations was?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: No. And, if I did, I wouldn't discuss them here, because that has to be navigated very carefully.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, one of the reasons I ask is, we do have this this mid-November deadline that the State Department, the Pentagon have set for Israel to improve the flow of aid to Gaza's two million residents. The U.N. says there is famine already, or on the verge of famine.",
      "If it is found that Israel is indeed violating. U.S. law, would you hold them accountable? Should there be consequences? Because they are recipients of U.S. aid.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Well, I have had huge disagreements with this administration in terms of how they've administered their entire policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is U.S. law. It's not just this administration. It's humanitarian law.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Yes. Well, I think what we've seen just break out again in the past 70-plus hours since President Trump won the election, Hamas is now looking for total peace. So I think the environment has totally changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What do you mean?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They've announced they'd like to see peace. They like to see peace in Gaza. Let's see where that leads.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You believe \u2013 you believe that there will be a hostage deal negotiated under President Trump?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I would like to see what \u2013 I would like to see what Hamas means by this statement. But it seems that the entire environment is shifting right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Because they see new leadership coming in. And I'm encouraged by that, and I think we'll have new opportunities to \u2013 again, President Trump was able to deliver peace through strength.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that's on the way, and I'm optimistic what it might lead to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, one of the interesting dynamics we saw in this election was that Mr. Trump was able to, in some ways, successfully campaign and peel off Muslim voters, Arab voters. Certainly, in the state of Michigan, you saw some of that.",
      "Do you think \u2013 and they were frustrated by the carnage in Gaza. As a result, do you think Mr. Trump ends up with more wiggle room here to perhaps hold the Israeli prime minister to account, or does he just give a green light?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think what President Trump is going to do is focus on the root cause, to borrow a term that was used a great deal in the last administration.",
      "He's going to focus on Iran, because the cause of this is the Iranian funding and training\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 of Hamas, of Hezbollah, of the Houthis. That would have never happened\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of\u2026",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: \u2026 except for the fact that they released the enforcement of sanctions\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 upholding international law and U.S. legal standards to recipients of U.S. military aid, do you think he will stick by that?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: President Trump is certainly going to uphold U.S. law, but he is also going to make certain that our allies are properly cared for and that our adversaries are dealt with accordingly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I don't have to tell you this, because you know Asia really well, but five of America's seven treaty commitments are in that Asia-Pacific.",
      "The U.S. has exposure there in a tremendous way. The last time Donald Trump was president, he talked about pulling U.S. troops out of Japan, pulling them out of South Korea. Is that a priority now, reducing the military footprint in Asia?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think that comes back again to the failure of the elite here in Washington, Margaret, to understand how a businessperson negotiates.",
      "Everybody has got to sit down and talk about what the options are. We have been supporting military presence in that area ever since World War Two, ever since the Korean War, a significant investment on behalf of the American people.",
      "Those investments were made at a time when these economies were collapsed. They were developing countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Today, they are fully developed countries. It's entirely relevant and I think appropriate for President Trump to discuss, within the level of support\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of signaling strength, saying we might ditch our allies isn't exactly a positive message, right?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I think the message should be that our allies can and should step up to the extent possible to strengthen their own capabilities. We're seeing it happen. We're seeing it happen in Japan.",
      "They've agreed to double their defense budget from 1 percent to 2 percent of GDP. That's a positive development.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: They're trying to work more closely with us. I think, in President Trump's administration, they definitely will.",
      "This is the direction that we need to go. Same for South Korea.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I let you go, you are on a number of powerful Senate Committees. Do you think you're more useful to Mr. Trump in the Senate, or would you join his Cabinet, if asked?",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: I will just say this.",
      "I was privileged to have a tremendous career in business, but one of the greatest honors in my life was to represent the United States, the greatest country in the world, in President Trump's administration overseas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: It's also been one of the greatest honors in my life to represent the people of Tennessee serving in the United States Senate.",
      "In whatever role I hold going \u2013 going forward, it's going to be advanced - - it's going to be advancing the positions that President Trump has articulated that the American people overwhelmingly supported.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: And I will do that in whatever role necessary, but we are going to see America strong again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Hagerty, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR BILL HAGERTY: Thank you so much, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan.",
      "Jake, good to have you here.",
      "JAKE SULLIVAN (U.S. National Security Adviser): Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we know President Biden and president-elect Trump will meet in the Oval Office on Wednesday.",
      "There are a lot of fires around the world. What is it that President Biden wants to deliver in terms of a focus and message?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, the first and most important message will be that President Biden is committed to the peaceful transfer of power and to a responsible handoff from one president to the next, which is in the best tradition of our country and has been for the last 240 years.",
      "And then they will go through the top issues, both domestic and foreign policy issues, including what is happening in Europe and Asia and the Middle East. And the president will have the chance to explain to President Trump how he sees things, where they stand and talk to President Trump about how President Trump is thinking about taking on these \u2013 these issues when he takes office.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's go to Ukraine, because we just heard from Senator Hagerty that world view from that portion of the Republican Party right now.",
      "We know the war is expanding there. The North Korean troops seem to have entered the fight. You have all these adversaries all in on Russia winning there. What can you do in the remaining 70 days to sort of change what's happening on the ground or Trump-proof the strategy, so to speak?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, look, our approach remains the same as it's been for the last 2.5 years, which is to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position on the battlefield, so that it is ultimately in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table.",
      "And it should be up to Ukraine to decide, for its own sovereignty and its own territorial integrity, when and how it goes to the negotiating table. It should be up to the United States and a coalition of nations that we have built to continue to supply Ukraine with the means to defend itself against brutal Russian aggression.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've got, like, what, $6 billion in money left that's already\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And President Biden made clear when President Zelenskyy was here in Washington a couple of months ago that we would spend all of the resources that were provided to us by the Congress on time and in full, meaning that, by January 20, we will have sent the full amount of resources and aid to Ukraine the Congress has authorized.",
      "And, of course, President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe.",
      "And, ultimately, as the Japanese Prime Minister said, if we walk away from Ukraine in Europe, the question about America's commitment to our allies in Asia will grow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you mean President Biden is going to ask Congress to pass more money for Ukraine before he leaves office?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Look, I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal.",
      "But President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term, because the threat to Ukraine will remain no matter what exactly happens on the battlefield or at the negotiating table, and the United States should not walk away from its commitment, either to Ukraine or to 50 nations that we have rallied in defense of Ukraine in both Europe and Asia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, U.S. intelligence assessed that Russia favored Donald Trump in this election, that Russia interfered in a fairly dramatic and visible fashion with these fake videos.",
      "What consequence are they going to pay, if any, for doing that?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first, let's not forget that we are currently helping Ukraine fight Russia in Ukraine\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 in the most dramatic and full-throated way one could \u2013 could imagine. So we are already doing a substantial number of things to impose costs on Russia.",
      "We have also passed the most sweeping sanctions on Russia that we have seen against a major economy in the world\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator Hagerty was saying it's \u2013 Russia's doing fine even with those sanctions.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, first of all, you can see in many different ways, whether it's inflation in Russia, whether it's their ability over time to actually grow their economy, their technology, their capacity to invest in new sources of energy going down the line, that the picture for Russia looks increasingly bleak as time goes on, and that the sanctions are biting.",
      "They have not stopped, obviously, Russia from being able to carry out its military operations in Ukraine today, but they have painted a darker picture for Ukraine \u2013 for Russia tomorrow.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what Russia is giving North Korea's Kim Jong-un in exchange for the men he is sending to fight on the battlefield in Ukraine?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: We don't know for sure.",
      "And, frankly, I think Vladimir Putin doesn't know for sure. I think he probably hasn't decided exactly what he's going to do for North Korea on a going-forward basis.",
      "But I will tell you this. Kim Jong-un expects that he's going to get something significant, probably in the form of military and technology support from Russia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For its nuclear program?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And that's a distinct possibility. I can't say exactly what will happen, but we have already heard the Russians come out and say that North Korea's nuclear program should be looked at differently today than it was five or 10 years ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So the concern about the relationship between Russia and North Korea in both directions is very real and something that all of the nations of the free world need to pay attention to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Prime Minister Netanyahu said he spoke to Donald Trump three times in the past few days. The Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, is coming to the White House. That was just announced.",
      "What makes you think in these final days of the Biden administration that Benjamin Netanyahu would agree to peace in Gaza or agree to peace in Lebanon and not hold on to that political capital for the new president?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Well, Prime Minister Netanyahu will make his decisions, and \u2013 and he'll speak to his decisions.",
      "Here's what I see. First, in Gaza, it really today is not Israel that is standing in the way of a cease-fire and hostage deal. It is Hamas. Israel has said it's prepared to do a temporary cease-fire for a number of hostages and then try to build on that to get all of the hostages home.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you know what\u2026",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Hamas has said no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 Mr. \u2013 Senator Hagerty was talking about on that with Hamas?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: I don't know about the particular statement he made.",
      "What I will tell you is, whatever Hamas is saying publicly, what they are communicating to the mediators is, no, we will not do a cease-fire-and- hostage deal at this time.",
      "So what we need to do is get the rest of the world to continue to increase pressure on Hamas to come to the table to do a deal in Gaza, because the Israeli government has said it's prepared to take a temporary step in that direction.",
      "And then, when it comes to Lebanon, we have been actively engaged in discussions with the Israeli government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Those should remain behind closed doors.",
      "But we do believe that, at some point, the Israeli government wants to do a deal that gets its citizens back home. I don't think it's doing that deal for American politics. I think it's doing that deal to try to secure Israel. And I expect that, in the coming weeks, we will see progress in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you hold Israel to account?",
      "Because the secretaries of state and defense have sent letters saying that they're not allowing in aid to the degree they should, and that there are possibly forced displacements from Northern Gaza. On this program, you have said that was essentially a red line.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: So, basically, what you have seen from Secretary Austin and Secretary Blinken is a letter to their Israeli counterparts that says\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: \u2026 here is a set of steps we expect you to take, and we are going to measure you against the progress you are making towards those steps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: This week, we will make our judgments about what kind of progress they have made. And then Secretary Austin, Secretary Blinken, the president will make judgments about what we do in response, and I'm not going to get ahead of that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, President Xi and President Biden will be in the same place at these summits in the next few days. Will the president confront him about this pervasive and massive hacking of telecom companies known as Salt Typhoon?",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: President Biden, every time he sees his Chinese counterpart, President Xi, speaks to him about cyber- enabled espionage, about cyberattacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is a significant attack.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: Yes, it is. It is an absolutely significant attack. It's something that the FBI, our Department of Homeland Security, and our entire national security enterprise is digging into in a big way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER JAKE SULLIVAN: And, of course, it will be on the agenda between every American official and every Chinese official in the weeks ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Jake Sullivan, a lot happening in the world. Thank you for coming in and talking to us.",
      "We'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're joined now by Democratic Congressman Ro Khanna. He's in California this morning.",
      "Good morning to you.",
      "This was a rough week for Democrats. I don't have to tell you that. But, Congressman, I mean, just to level with the American people, Democrats and the Harris campaign told them that the fate of democracy itself was at stake. Was that a cynical, political tactic, or, if it's reality, what is the plan now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA (D-CA): Well, Margaret, I think what was at stake is the degradation of American democracy. The course of this, a political discourse. The idea that you have people who are undocumented, 12 million, who may be subject to a violation of their rights. The issues is about climate and the reversal on that. I've never said that you weren't going to have future elections. And I was never one of these people who said you're not going to have 2026 or 2028. In one or two years, Donald Trump is going to be a lame duck.",
      "But I do think that we need to make sure we stand up for people's rights in this country and are looking forward and what we can do to win back the House and the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at CBS polling, when you compare Harris in 2024 to Biden in 2020, you see clearly that the Democratic coalition lost support among Latino voters, young voters, women. Republicans really made gains here with men of color as well. Why do you think there is this fracturing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: We did not have a compelling enough economic vision. The Democratic Party should have one simple mission, and that is to address the economic hardships and struggles of many Americans, not just working class Americans, a large slice of Americans who feel the American dream has slipped away for their families and their kids. And you have new voices, Congress people like Pat Ryan, Mary - Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, Chris Deluzio, who are saying, look, we need to have a vision on building new factories, on helping raise minimum wage, on dealing with child care, and emphasize that our party has a better economic story. I think that can unify our party, moderates and progressives, and it transcends race and will help us with Latino voters, black voters, white working class voters. And we had a better vision than Donald Trump on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, it's interesting, in this Monday morning quarterbacking that's happening, to hear from so many Democrats now who are saying that they think that economic message should have been front and center, but that they felt constrained somehow by this focus on identity politics. Tom Suozzi of New York brought that up, talking about Republicans being able to weaponize anarchy on college campuses, defunding the police, and gender questions and girls sports. Do you think this, you know, movement, woke politics, really was incredibly damaging to the left? Because a large part of that came from the progressive wing in - on which you are a member.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, I have always said that we need to be emphasizing the economic issues. But I don't think we should run away for standing up for trans rights, for standing up for equal rights for people, for teaching American history responsibly. You can be true to your values with two things, Margaret. One, if someone disagrees with you, we need to respect that disagreement, not cancel or shame them. Don't shy away from your convictions, but have a reasonable conversation. I did that with Megyn Kelly on a podcast on trans rights. I stuck to my position, but we had a reasonable conversation.",
      "The second thing is, if we emphasize the economic hardships people are facing. I've got $12 trillion in my district in Silicon Valley while towns like Johnstown (ph) were hollowed out. Galesburg, Illinois, were hollowed out. We can build new factories. We can build new industry. We can create new economic opportunity. We have a vision of how to do that. Joe Biden - President Biden started it. I think we can win over people, even if they may not agree with us, on a particular social issue.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you specifically about your district, since you just mentioned it. Silicon Valley was thought of as reliably blue, but particularly in this election you saw money going towards Donald Trump. You've seen some very prominent tech names, Elon Musk significantly. And J.D. Vance, the vice presidential candidate, he really reached out into that tech community as part of that campaign.",
      "What is the thing that Silicon Valley thinks it's going to get from a Trump administration? Is it - is it no taxes on capital gains? Is it not regulating crypto? What is it that the people in your district think they're getting from Donald Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, first of all, Margaret, 70 percent of Silicon Valley still supported Vice President Harris and Democrats.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: But you're right that we had slippage, and probably now 20 percent, 30 percent support Donald Trump. They have different reasons for doing it. Some of them want more free speech. Some of them want deregulation. Some of them want tax cuts. Some of them want AI not to be regulated. Some of them were concerned on crypto.",
      "But I think what the Democrats need to remind folks of, and I reminded Elon of this, is that Tesla got funding from President Obama. SpaceX got started because Ash Carter, under President Obama, helped Elon get that facility. The Democrats are the party that has invested in the science and technology to help build Silicon Valley. And we can be the party that helps AI and robotics build new factories, build new industry in different parts of the country.",
      "When we argue policy, we have a better vision for how to get Americans and prosperity in a modern economy. And if we focus on that, I believe we will win back the majority and win back in 2028.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Former Speaker Pelosi told \"The New York Times\" there were messaging errors, yes, but she also said, there should have been an open primary system here, and that President Biden's decision to endorse Vice President Harris immediately made it impossible.",
      "Do you agree with her?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: Well, look, I have a lot of respect for Speaker Pelosi, but I've sort of chuckled with people have said this about President Biden because the day he got out we had Democrats with the most over the top superlatives, comparing him to George Washington, saying he did the most honorable thing. So now to go back and criticize him seems a bit contradictory.",
      "I think this was a winnable campaign, even when he got out. Vice President Harris was five points up in some of the polls. Anyone who is saying now this was not a winnable campaign didn't say that back in August. The reason we didn't win ultimately is we didn't listen enough to people on the ground. People like Chris Deluzio, Pat Wright (ph), who were saying, talk about the economy. Talk about people's economic struggles. Have - convince people you have the better policies and better vision.",
      "The reason I'm hopeful for the future is, we have the substance. We actually - you can't build new factories just with tariffs and tax cuts. You need federal financing. We have actual investment in apprenticeships. And I think over the long run, the American people will see the truth of the policy ideas.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were a surrogate for Joe Biden. You were then a surrogate for Kamala Harris. And on this program you defended both many times. One place you did create space was on the issue of Gaza. You said when you were going to college campuses, when you were talking to progressives, when you were talking to voters of color, not just Arabs and Muslims, you heard there was a problem here.",
      "Do you think that the numbers you saw, particularly in Michigan, vindicated your point of view, or was there just a greater force at work?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE RO KHANNA: I think she would have certainly won Michigan if there was more of a reckoning with the failures of policy on Gaza. And that wasn't my point of view. That was the point of view of a lot of people I was hearing on the ground.",
      "I also think, beyond Michigan, this really was a concern for a lot of young people and a lot of progressives.",
      "Now, my hope is, because President Trump got some of the votes from the Muslim and Arab community, I was just on a bipartisan CODEL in Saudi Arabia, they have said that if the president wants a deal with Saudi Arabia that the Palestinian state and a two-state solution has to be front and center, and I hope we can work towards actually doing that after the war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ro Khanna. Congressman, thank you very much for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the economy and Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari. He joins us now.",
      "Neel, good morning to you.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI (Minneapolis Federal Reserve President): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, right after the election, another big event was the Federal Reserve moving on interest rates, cutting them for the second time so far this year. That seemed to indicate that you believe inflation is being defeated here.",
      "Can you tell us your assessment of how stable the economy is and how confident you are that we are on a glide path that will avoid recession?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we've made a lot of progress in bringing inflation down, and the economy has remained remarkably strong. We keep getting revisions to GDP that are - show that the economy is growing even faster than we had appreciated, and the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent. So, right now, the economy is in a good place. Inflation is still running around 2.5 percent or so. So, we're not all the way home. We need to finish the job. But so far so good. I mean I don't want to declare victory yet. We need to finish the job. But we're on a good path right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Finish the job. Are - you're - it sounds like you're expecting another rate cut?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, we want to have confidence that inflation is going to go all the way back down to our 2 percent target. So, if you look at the - what we call the summary of economic projections, which are the forecast that my colleagues and I put out, the expectation is that we would do another interest rate cut in December. We need to actually see what the data looks like before reaching any conclusions. And that's six weeks from now. But I think another rate cut is certainly possible.",
      "But ultimately, if the economy continues to perform well, a strong economy, a strong labor market, that's going to - that's the outcome that we're all trying to achieve. And I don't think that that's a partisan view. I think everybody's on board with trying to achieve that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Fed is apolitical. But we are looking at promises of major changes in this new administration. One of them is mass deportations.",
      "When you were last here in June, we talked about the impact of immigration on inflation. You said, in some ways it helps lower it by filling jobs. At the same time you said it may contribute to it because it creates more demand for goods.",
      "How long before we would see the economic impact of say a mass deportation plan?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, it's a great question, Margaret. I mean I think - if you just assume that people are working, either working in farms or working in factories, and then those businesses now lose employees, that would probably cause some disruption for those businesses as they try to respond to that. And so the implications for inflation are not entirely clear to me. I think ultimately it's going to be between the business community and Congress and the executive branch to figure out what \u2013 you know, how they would adjust to that and how - how long it would take and how disruptive it would be.",
      "I don't have any insight into that. I'm not sure what the inflation implications would be. I think it's a big question of how long it would take, how many new immigrants were coming in. There's just so much uncertainly about what the actual policies will be, what will get passed through the Congress, how it will be implemented. We, at the Fed, will simply wait. We have to wait and see what the rest of the government decides to do before we analyze what it means for the economy going forward.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I know you don't control fiscal policy, but the president-elect has unveiled a plan that estimates say would add $8 trillion to the deficit. How concerned are you about rising deficits?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, if you look over the long-term, if you look at, for example, at the Congressional Budget Office forecast of debts and deficits, they grow to the moon. They grow unsustainably. So, at some point, those have to be addressed. And that is purely the domain of the Congress and the executive branch to negotiate how to do that. At some point they have to be addressed. And so our focus is, whatever Congress and the administration decide to do, we have our goals. Our goals are 2 percent inflation and a strong labor market, maximum employment, and we will adjust our monetary policies to try to achieve that.",
      "But, you're right, over the long run, it's clear that the deficit needs to be addressed. But that is also, as I said, the domain of Congress and the executive branch to sort out.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Goldman Sachs analysts were out this week with a report saying that the last time we saw Trump tariffs, it - the cost was passed along to consumers. They estimate every 5 percent increase in the tariff rate would reduce corporate earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent because it would pull back consumer spending, possibly trigger retaliatory tariffs and increased uncertainty. How much of a downside risk is there if we get into this business of tariffs?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: Well, from an inflation perspective, it's pretty easy to model a one-time tariff. So, if somebody imposed a 1 percent tariff or a 10 percent tariff, you would think that that would increase prices of those goods either 1 percent or 10 percent. That's pretty easy to model and it shouldn't have an effect long-run on inflation.",
      "The challenge becomes if there's a tit for tat and it's one country imposing tariffs and then responses and it's escalating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: That's where it becomes more concerning, and, frankly, a lot more uncertain.",
      "So I think, again, with - as is with fiscal policy, we'll have to wait and see what actually gets implemented and then how other countries might respond to that. It's just - right now we're just all guessing what will actually happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's safe to say that the new president will take office with what appears to be the economy trending upwards?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: The economy is strong. You know, when I reach out to business and labor unions all around my region it's one of cautious optimism, that the economy is doing well, there are jobs available. And we want to keep the economy doing well. We want to keep that growth going while we get inflation all the way back down to 2 percent. And so, right now, I would say, we have a strong economy, and that's a really good thing. And our objective is to keep it there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Chair Powell was asked this week at a press conference if he would resign if asked. He made clear he does not think that the law would require that. And, in fact, it would violate the law.",
      "But there is a broader conversation right now about political influence on the Fed. Are you concerned about it?",
      "NEEL KASHKARI: I'm not. My colleagues and I at the Federal Reserve are totally committed to the dual mandate goals of 2 percent inflation and maximum employment that Congress has assigned us. That's what's driving the decisions that we've been making. And that will continue to do so.",
      "And there are also structural elements that are designed by Congress to provide continuity. So, the governors at the board of governors in Washington serve up to 14-year terms. The presidents of the reserve banks are independent. These are structures that Congress put in place to provide continuity. Between that and, I think, bipartisan support, that we all want to get inflation back down to 2 percent and we want to keep the economy strong, I'm confident that we will continue to focus on our economic jobs, and that's what should be dictating what we're doing, and that is what's dictating what we're doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Neel Kashkari, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're now joined by Dame Karen Pierce, the U.K.'s ambassador to the United States.",
      "Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE (British Ambassador to the United States): Thank you very much, Margaret. Nice to be here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Ambassador, after this election there was a lot of chatter in Europe about Europe needing to act alone, or at least without as much of an American support mechanism there. The French president said, \"Europe needs to take back control.\" Italy's prime minister said, \"don't ask what the U.S. can do for you, ask what Europe should do for itself.\"",
      "What do you think Trump's return will mean for Europe?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I think in all my experience, Margaret, when America and Europe work together, that's when you get success. That's when you get coherence in policy. We saw that in the Balkans. We've seen it at every conflict since the 1990s. It's great that Europe wants to do more. We want to be a part of that. We've got a lot of burden sharing going on in Europe on Ukraine. I think perhaps it's not well understood in America, if I may say so, quite how much Europe is doing for Ukraine, and we want to talk about that with the incoming administration, as well as work with the Biden team to help Ukraine even further.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The United Kingdom, of course, has provided a tremendous amount of weaponry and support to Ukraine.",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: That's exactly right. I think we're over $16 billion all in. We provided the first tanks. We provided the first anti-tank weapons. We have trained Ukrainian pilots. We're going to go on supporting Ukraine for as long as they need us.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will you do that if the United States cuts off financial and military aid to Ukraine?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, we obviously hope that doesn't happen and we're going to be wanting to have lots of conversations with the outgoing and incoming administrations on just how best to support Ukraine. I think we all want the same thing. We want a stable, secure, peaceful Euro-Atlantic area. And if Putin is allowed to succeed in Ukraine, that threatens all of us, including the U.S., and it certainly emboldens China. And I don't think anyone in the U.S. wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on Friday, Hungary's prime minister, Viktor Orban, who is a problematic NATO ally, he's friends with Vladamir Putin and Donald Trump, he said, \"the situation on the front is obvious. There's been a military defeat. The Americans are going to pull out of this war.\" He's talking about Ukraine.",
      "Do you think Mr. Trump is persuadable on this issue?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: Well, I don't think it's for any single European leader to say what President Trump might do. I think we need to hear from President Trump after inauguration on what the new administration plans are. But certainly, I know they share our goal of wanting to have security and stability, and we'll be talking to them and the outgoing Biden administration to see how best we can support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mr. Orban does speak with Donald Trump, but you don't get the sense that he is reflecting what's next?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We speak to Donald Trump. The prime minister spoke to him very recently on the Wednesday after, the day after the election.",
      "In my experience, President Trump is his own person. He'll listen to a lot of advice, some of it solicited, some of it unsolicited, and he'll weigh the pros and cons and he'll come to his own decision. But I have always found him and his team very willing to listen to our point of view.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on the trade front, there's also concern in Europe, as I understand it, about what may be coming with tariffs. The Trump campaign has proposed a 10 percent across the board tariff on Europe. Goldman Sachs projects it will be perhaps a little bit more limited and focused on auto exports. Do you have a sense that the U.K. may be able to avoid this kind of financial penalty, essentially?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: We would very much hope so, as the U.K. You know, we've got free trade in our DNA, as it were. We don't believe in tariffs as an instrument of trade. We have a slightly different approach for many American trade specialists on that. And I think the last thing the world needs at the moment is a tariff war. That doesn't help anybody. Trade and investments is a hugely important part of what we do with America. Something like a trillion dollars goes backwards and forwards across the Atlantic in trade and investment each year. Let's not put that at risk. Let's try and find out how we can work together to increase investment in trade. And there's also the really important issue of economic security that's now come onto the agenda. And we'll be wanting to talk to the incoming administration about that also.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you served here in Washington during the first Trump administration. You know many of these players. The current U.K. government is a different one, of course, from that period of time, with the Labour Party in charge. I have to ask you about that direct relationship, because the top diplomat, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, years ago, and you know this quote, wrote, \"Trump is not only a woman-hating, neo-Nazi sympathizing sociopath, he's a profound threat to the international order.\"",
      "Are you concerned that those past statements, and the ideological differences, will be a problem in what has been a special relationship?",
      "DAME KAREN PIERCE: I don't think the past statements will be a problem, to be absolutely honest, Margaret. Politicians say a lot of things on both sides. And even in America, some people who are now in the Trump administration, or will be in the Trump administration, like the vice president-elect, have also said critical things about President Trump.",
      "In my experience, politicians kind of absorb those sorts of comments as part of the wear and tear of political life. What's important is the relationship now. David Lammy, the foreign secretary, the prime minister, Keir Starmer, had a very warm dinner with President Trump in September. He very graciously invited them to his private home in Trump Tower. We discussed a huge range of issues.",
      "You're right that they come from different political philosophies. I won't call them ideological. I don't think Keir Starmer is ideological. And I don't think President Trump is. It's about finding out how we can work together. What they do have in common is this desire to get the economies moving, to get growth for the ordinary citizen, to make sure things are better for the ordinary citizen. And we had a very good conversation about that with President Trump in September.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it. Thank you for watching. Happy birthday, Marines!",

      "The 68-year-old said he was struggling with mental health issues and was arrested for various charges including theft and possession of drug paraphernalia. His car was impounded by police and he was assigned to veterans' treatment court, where Hennen said he got help for the first time.",
      "\"By the time I got it diagnosed and treated and started to get my life under control, I had very little money,\" he wrote in a September letter.",
      "Hennen told CBS News he didn't have enough to get his car back.",
      "Hennen said he was living off a small Social Security payment and was isolated in his home in East Grand Forks, Minnesota, right across the river from Grand Forks \u2014 until he met\u00a0Larry Mendivil Jr.\u00a0through a coordinator at the court.",
      "Mendivil, an Air Force veteran who had been deployed five times and worked on inspections and repairs, struggled to ease back into civilian life.",

      "The military, he said, \"trains you for war but don't train how to live when you get out.\"",
      "Navigating life in Grand Forks, or other rural areas without a car can be daunting.",
      "\"The most important thing in North Dakota is you got to have something here to drive. Everyone here knows how important a car is,\" said Mendivil.",
      "Sobriety and stability can come with transportation",
      "Nearly a quarter of U.S. veterans \u2014 4.4 million \u2014 live in rural communities and a large portion struggle with poverty, isolation and access to healthcare. Transportation can be key for many military members returning to civilian life \u2014 but researchers found it's often an afterthought.",
      "Researchers Andrea Lubin and Stephanie Dipetrillo found transport access should be considered \"an essential service\" without which veterans \"can have a difficult time reintegrating into civilian life,\" they wrote in a 2015 report for the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "For many, a vehicle is a necessity: 71.6% of workers living at the poverty level use personal vehicles to get to work. Without transportation, veterans can become isolated and that can exacerbate underlying mental health issues and other struggles. About 35,574 veterans, like Mendivil, experienced homelessness in 2023 in the U.S., according to Veterans Affairs.",
      "Experts say that since American society is organized around automobiles, having a vehicle is essential to making money.",
      "Mendivil told Hennen he had a 2007 Honda Accord that needed a new battery, alternator, and starter but he would fix it, for free. It was a kindness, Hennen said, that changed his entire situation.",
      "Lubin, managing director at Rutgers University's Voorhees Transportation Center told CBS News veterans interviewed for their report said \"transportation costs\" or cars were rarely discussed with assisting organizations after they returned stateside.",
      "Mendivil, 42, found his way back to sobriety and stability through cars. He started helping his uncle, a mechanic, around his shop. Mendivil was fixing cars when he got a call from an old Air Force buddy.",
      "His Suzuki truck had stalled and his buddy couldn't get to his new job, a setback he was sure would get him fired and imperil the fragile life he just started to rebuild. Mendivil drove an hour to his friend's house, picked him up and dropped him off at work. But then he went the extra step, and fixed the truck, showing his friend some mechanical skills in the process.",
      "He then launched the nonprofit Miracles for Vets, or Mv4, which assists veterans with rides, fixes their cars and donates repaired vehicles to veterans who don't have transportation.",
      "\"It's a brotherhood\"",
      "On a scrappy budget of less than $50,000 a year, Mendivil said he's helped 300 veterans fix their cars over the years and just gave away his 45th vehicle. His methods, he says, are relatively straightforward. He keeps it about the veterans and the vehicle.",
      "\"We are so small and we've all been in the military. It's a brotherhood,\" Ross Weiler, the foundation's board chair, told CBS News. He said, \"Larry is a gearhead, and I'm a gearhead.\"",
      "Miracles for Vets works out of a garage on Dyke Avenue in Grand Forks, partnering with different suppliers to fix the cars that come through. Auto Glass and Automakers have donated four windshields to cars for veterans, and Mendivil said the company gives \"a free install for the windshield if we are out of money and if it's for a veteran.\"",
      "Grand Forks Treatment Court sends mandated workers to help out at the garage in the afternoons, Mendivil said, otherwise it's mainly just him and one other mechanic fixing cars. Veterans sometimes congregate at the garage just to see the vehicles the organization is working on or get a tune-up of their own.",
      "Donald Lapham, 61, said Miracles for Vets has helped him with his 2006 GMC Sierra truck when the transmission doesn't work. He spent 17 years in the Army reserves and now lives in his truck, Lapham said, \"dealing with depression and bad knees.\"",

      "\"I'll never be an important person, yet helping veterans to stay mobile and giving them free cars is super important to me,\" Mendivil said.",
      "Hennen, the veteran who got the 2007 Honda Accord agreed. Once he had his car he didn't have to take the bus to the grocery store. That trip, he said, would take him about an hour each way, and was tough in the \"rough winters.\" Now Hennen said, he jumps in his car and drives 10 minutes each way. He is planning on visiting his three granddaughters who live 300 miles away.",

    "summary": "Researching her family history, Cheryl Wills found she was related to a former slave who served in the Civil War with the United States Colored Troops, which led her to a distant relative, a former plantation, and ultimately to Private Sandy Wills' remains.",
    "story": [
      "This past August Army Private Sandy Wills was buried with full military honors at a veterans' cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. Private Wills served his country, though not in this century, or the last. He died in 1889.",
      "He was originally laid to rest in an unmarked grave, a Civil War veteran all but lost to history.",
      "\"No one knew about Sandy Wills,\" said Cheryl wills, Sandy's great-great-great-granddaughter. \"An enslaved man leaves a plantation, serves during the Civil War with Lincoln's army, and poof!\u00a0 Like it never happened.\"",
      "Cheryl didn't know of him, or her family's long military legacy, until she started researching her ancestry. And it was tragedy that first sparked her interest in genealogy.",
      "Her father, a New York City firefighter and Vietnam-era veteran, was killed in a motorcycle accident when she was a teenager. She recalled, \"When I sat at his funeral, the one thing that was burned into my heart was when the military honored him. And then they handed my mother a folded flag. And at that moment, I realized my father was special in the eyes of the greatest army in the world.\"",
      "Like millions of Black Americans, Cheryl's family had left the South as part of the Great Migration. Her grandparents moved from Tennessee to New York City. For the past 30 years, Cheryl, an author and journalist, has been telling other people's stories, all the while knowing little of her own.",
      "When asking her family about the past, she said, \"No one knew anything. And that was one question I used to ask them: 'What do you know about slavery?' And they would look at me like, 'What kind of question is that?' Those who lived through slavery, it was like they had this pact: We're not passing this story down. You don't want to know what it was like.\u00a0So, Sandy's story disappeared from our family.\"",
      "Combing through census, birth, marriage and death records, Cheryl meticulously traced the roots and branches of her family tree. The earliest ancestor she was able to document: Sandy Wills, who was bought by Willis Wills when he was 10 years old.",
      "The Holy Grail of her search was Sandy Wills' military records. He'd volunteered for the colored troops in 1863 and was honorably discharged. He worked as a sharecropper on the Moore plantation after the war, and married a woman named Emma; they had nine children. Records showed when Sandy died, but Cheryl could find no trace of where he was buried. \"He was nowhere to be found, essentially MIA,\" she said.",
      "Her search did lead her to a living relative, Ethan West, a distant cousin also researching his family. \"She was going through finding Sandy, and I've been posting a lot of stuff about my lineage,\" he said. \"And our lineages collided.\"",
      "She called Ethan her hero: \"He physically went down there.\"",
      "\"Down there\" is Brownsville, in Haywood County, Tennessee. They both had come across records placing some of their ancestors, including Sandy Wills, on a plantation there owned by the Moore family. \"I just wanted to know what this place that we're reading about looked like,\" said West. \"I found the coordinates to where the property would have been.\"",
      "In 2013, West went driving around Haywood County looking for answers, and literally saw a sign: Mooreland. \"And when he texted me that sign, I went, holy guacamole,\" said Cheryl. \"And I think both of our lives changed.\"",
      "Mooreland is 900 lush acres of cotton, soybeans and pecan trees. Over the years, Cheryl and Ethan would visit, and gradually formed a unique bond with the Moore descendants, telling them of their family's connections to the farm \u2013 and their belief that a Civil War veteran was buried on their property.",
      "And the Moores told them something they had hoped to hear \u2013 that there is an unmarked African American burial ground on their farm. \u00a0\"They took me there, and for that, I'm eternally grateful,\" said Cheryl. \"Because we had no idea it was there. We only had a hunch.\"",
      "Cheryl hired an archeology team with experience finding America's missing-in-action from more recent wars. Of the 38 graves they found here, they zeroed in on one \u2013 its size, date, and fragmentary remains matched every known detail of her ancestor.",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" was there with the families and local veterans when Private Sandy Wills' remains were placed in a casket, and solemnly marched from the knoll, through green fields, to a waiting hearse.",
      "Edie Moore, the family matriarch, said that for generations the Moores kept that African-American cemetery on their property untouched. \"A farmer would come along and say, 'Oh, if it were me, I would just bulldoze down that clump of trees and plant on top of it,\" said Edie. \"We said, 'No, it's hallowed ground. And we will never ever touch it.' And my husband, he had daffodils that he planted over the whole cemetery.\"",
      "Knowing it was the resting place for Private Wills, she said, \"adds depth to the whole experience.\"",
      "After the exhumation, the Moores hosted a picnic at the farm \u2013 two families connected by this land, and by America's complicated history.",
      "A headstone now marks Sandy Wills' grave at the West Tennessee State Veterans Cemetery. For Cheryl Wills, it's mission accomplished.",
      "\"History really meant for him to be anonymous forever,\" she said. \"He was a man without a legacy for 135 years. And now, it's been taken back.\"",

    "title": "Iraq War veteran Joe Dan Worley's purposeful life",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 09:13:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Twenty years after being grievously wounded in the Battle of Fallujah, losing his left leg to a roadside bomb, the battlefield medic has recovered from his traumatic injuries, grown his family, and turned to music to honor his fallen comrades.",
    "story": [
      "We first met Joe Dan Worley 20 years ago, along with his mother, wife Angel, and a three-month-old daughter, at Walter Reed Hospital outside Washington.",
      "A medic rushing to the aid of wounded Marines in Iraq, Worley was hit by a roadside bomb \u2013 his left leg blown off, his right riddled with bullets. \"When I hit the ground, I was purely convinced that my entire body was just ravaged, I mean, that I was dead,\" he said.",
      "His mother said, \"Our life is just turned upside-down.\"",
      "It wasn't just Worley's grievous wounds; the cost of moving to Washington to be with him had drained the family savings. They didn't even have enough for the baby's winter clothes.",
      "Then, his mother said \"an angel\" walked in the door: \"She just sat down and started talking to all of us, and just wrote out a check and handed it to the kids.\"",
      "That angel was sent by Karen Guenther, who was an ICU nurse at Camp Pendleton, California, when the wounded started coming in. \"I believe God just put me in the right place at the right time,\" she said. \"I was standing next to a young spouse, and she was about 18 years old, and her husband, he was very disfigured, and she looked at him and her knees started to buckle. So, I sort of held her and whispered in her ear and I said, 'You've got this, you can do this.' And just experiencing that changed everything.\"",
      "Guenther had experience dealing with traumatic injuries, but she said what was so different in this case was that \"this was so personal, and the number of injuries that we saw coming back, the severity of the injuries coming back, were historic.\"",
      "Many of them were coming back from the all-out battle for the insurgent stronghold of Fallujah. \"We saw the families coming from all across the country to be by their son or daughter's bedside,\" Guenther said. \"They were leaving their jobs, leaving their homes, but yet they still had to have a car payment and a mortgage, and they just simply couldn't do it. So, that's when we started the fund.\"",
      "She called it the Semper Fi & America's Fund. \"I didn't know anything about starting a nonprofit, so I went to Barnes & Noble and I bought every book I could on nonprofits,\" she said. \"'Nonprofits for Dummies' was my very first book!\"",
      "The Battle of Fallujah raged for seven weeks. \"It was overwhelming,\" said Guenther. \"At that time we did not have much money in the bank, enough to take care of the number of wounded coming back.\"",
      "Until the public met Joe Dan Worley, who told \"60 Minutes\" in 2004, \"I worry all the time about being able to take care of my family, you know, and wondering what the future is going to hold.\"",
      "Guenther said, \"If that piece hadn't run, we would not have had the funds to take care of the families.\"",
      "To date, the Semper Fi Fund has given $500 million to 33,000 service members and their families \u2013 not just Marines, but all the armed services.",
      "In the beginning, the fund was focused on responding at the bedside of the wounded. But the real work started once service members went home. \"If you come back and you're quadriplegic or you're a triple amputee, or even a simple, single amputee, there's a life cycle of recovery,\" said Guenther, \"and these young men and women would need us for the rest of their lives.\"",
      "Worley was walking, but still wounded. His marriage to Angel was on the rocks. \"It was a really rough patch,\" he said.",
      "\"Something had to change or we weren't going to make it,\" said Angel.",
      "Martin said, \"That would have been a real shame.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it would have,\" she replied. \"I think what made us work is we didn't give up on each other at the same time.\"",
      "Worley added, \"There are not many marriages that make it through what we've made it through.\"",
      "He started working out, with a vengeance, and their family kept growing. Abby, who turned one while her father was still at Walter Reed, is now 20. She has a sister and two brothers.",
      "Worley supplements his disability benefits by co-hosting a podcast for the American Legion. Even so, a case worker from Semper Fi checks in once a month. \"For 20 years, they're always there,\" said Angel. \"Like, we know if we really truly needed anything, we could ask.\"",
      "Martin asked, \"Would you call yourself happy today?\"",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" Angel replied. \"I always tell people, if you can make it through the hard times, what's on the other side is so much better. It's so worth it. Life is so good. We are so blessed.\"",
      "But, Guenther said, not all of their stories are success stories: \"Our warriors are proud and strong and courageous, but sometimes they wear a mask, and they don't allow others to see how much pain they're going through, or the brain damage from blasts and concussion injuries.\"",
      "Do they know of people who have lost their marriages? \"We do, especially our catastrophic injuries,\" she said. \"Oftentimes, right after the injury, the families, their adrenaline's going \u2013 I can do this, I'm going to stay by my husband or wife's side \u2013 but as the years go on, it can be very tough on marriages.\"",
      "Living on the outskirts of Atlanta, the Worley family is rich in the things that matter, with a pet pig on the side. But Joe Dan will never be free of Fallujah. For the 20th anniversary of the battle, he's turned to music, recording a song, \"The Ballad of JoeDan.\"",
      "\"This is my song, that is for my guys that got killed while I was over there,\" he said. \"I'm carrying these people in my heart, not on my back, but in my heart.\"",
      "\"The Ballad of JoeDan\" is full of sorrow, but the life he has made is full of purpose. \"The body probably could have done without a traumatic amputation, but I really love what I've grown into,\" he said.",

    "title": "Honoring women, the \"forgotten\" Vietnam veterans on Veterans Day",
    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 09:00:16 -0500",
    "summary": "About 7,000 U.S. women served overseas as nurses during the Vietnam War. These veterans are working to ensure their contributions are honored on Veterans' Day 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Between 1967 and 1968, Nancy Wells spent her waking hours stitching injured Americans back together amid the haze of the Vietnam War, treating wounds she'd never imagined seeing.",
      "When not on the hospital wards, Wells and her fellow nurses lived like other soldiers: They ate at the same mess hall, slept in the same Quonset-hut dorms, called hooches, and were jolted out of bed by the same alarms and explosions. Some nurses suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. And all were subject to the same upheaval and protests when they returned stateside.",
      "Yet after the war, there was far less support and community for nurses and little recognition from the public of what they went through overseas. On Veterans' Day, nurses gather at the Vietnam Women's Memorial, which was built in 1993 after years of advocacy, to honor the service of the \"forgotten veterans.\"",
      "\"It seemed like the choppers would never stop coming in\"",
      "About 7,000 American women served in Vietnam as nurses during the war. Many, like Wells, were recruited from nursing school. Those who completed the Army's student nurse program and passed state nursing exams were commissioned as Second Lieutenants in the Army Nurse Corps. While overseas, they often served in multiple hospitals during one-year tours.\u00a0Wells worked at the 85th Evacuation Hospital in Qui Nohn and at the 71st Evacuation Hospital at Pleiku. There, she said, red alerts that meant enemy and hostile fire in the area became a part of daily life.",
      "\"You'd have to throw on your steel pot (helmet) and your flak jacket and go over to the hospital wards\" when the alarm went off, Wells, now 80 and living in Michigan, told CBS News. \"The siren would be blaring. Initially, it was a little frightening. You could hear the gunfire off in the distance. But after enough red alerts, you kind of became used to it.\"",
      "Even when the world around them was calm, there were always soldiers in need in the hospital wards. At the 71st Evacuation Hospital, there often weren't enough staff members to cover the 400 beds. Wells said she and her fellow nurses would work six or even seven days a week there, \"depending on the casualties coming in.\" During one period in November 1967, she said there were three weeks of nonstop casualties, coming so fast that medical personnel were flown in from other locations to help the 71st. During this period, the Battle of Dak To was taking place in Vietnam's Central Highlands. It was one of the bloodiest battles of the war.",
      "\"There were days when it seemed like the choppers would never stop coming in with the wounded,\" said Wells. \"Those were hard days, and the wounds the guys were coming in with were horrendous.\"",
      "In January 1968, the hospital was in the path of the Tet Offensive, a major military campaign by Vietnamese forces. Some hospital wards at the 71st were closed because \"it was felt that we were in too dangerous of an area to keep very many wounded\" soldiers, Wells said. Meanwhile, Wells and her other nurses moved into the hospital, because it was deemed a safer place than their hooches.",
      "Even when the crises slowed down, nurses like Wells had duties that went far beyond what they might do at a hospital in the United States. Wells said doctors assigned to the wards might only be there once or twice a week, so nurses would write orders for infection treatment and pain medications. They also cared for delayed wound closures, which meant carefully monitoring a non-critical wound for a week before it was surgically repaired. Medical personnel also did outreach work, treating injuries and giving vaccinations to some Vietnamese civilians when conditions allowed.",
      "On top of that, the nurses passed medications, checked IVs and bandages, gave injections and did everything they could to keep soldiers' spirits high. For Wells, caring for the soldiers she affectionately calls \"her boys\" meant sometimes skirting regulations.",
      "\"One of my boys came up to me in his wheelchair, and he said, 'Ma'am, is there anything to eat?' I'm hungry.' I told him 'No, but I know where to get some food,'\" said Wells. \"This was late at night. I snuck down to the chow hall, and didn't see anybody, so I took an entire sheet cake and took it back up to the ward so my boys could have a midnight snack.\"",
      "\"We didn't send women to Vietnam\"",
      "Wells came home from Vietnam on Easter Sunday in 1968. Her supervisor recommended she change out of her uniform to avoid negative attention in the airport, but she was determined to \"walk tall\" as she reunited with her family.",
      "Soon, though, Wells realized she was having a hard time adjusting back to civilian life. It took two months before she could bear to work as a nurse again, and she felt that she could no longer connect with her old friends. Whenever they talked about parties and beauty salons, she could only think about the conditions she had spent the past year in \u2014 the conditions her \"boys\" were still experiencing.",
      "She and her husband, a fellow Vietnam veteran, both struggled to talk about their experiences in the country \u2014 something she said likely contributed to their divorce. She struggled to sleep at night, and couldn't bear being in a large crowd or hearing the sounds of helicopters. Wells would later be diagnosed with and treated for PTSD.",
      "In 1980, she felt she was ready to connect with other veterans, so she went to her local VFW. She had identification confirming her service but was rebuffed and told she could join the Ladies Auxiliary, a volunteer group for women and family members who did not serve. The organization was rebranded as the VFW Auxiliary in 2015.",
      "\"I walked into the building, I was met by a gentlemen ... and told him that I wanted to join. And he said 'The VFW is for veterans,'\" Wells recalled. \"He couldn't believe that I was a veteran, just the same as he was. I walked out and never went back.\"",
      "That wasn't an unusual experience for nurses coming home. Constance Evans, who spent a year serving at the 12th Evacuation Hospital in Cu Chi, said she was invited to join the Ladies Auxiliary, but not welcomed into her local VFW in Idaho. She spent months campaigning to be part of the latter organization and was eventually accepted.\u00a0Evans, who is part of the Nez Perce tribe, said she was also excluded from a tribal ceremony honoring veterans for years. Donna Barbisch, a former Vietnam nurse and retired Army officer, remembered talking to a woman who didn't know any American women had been overseas.",
      "\"She was expressing negative sentiment about the war, and I told her that I thought she had some of the facts mixed up,\" Barbisch, 77, who lives in Washington, D.C. now, recalled. \"And she said 'Oh, how would you know?' I said 'I was there.' She said, 'Oh, no, you weren't there, we didn't send women to Vietnam.'\"",
      "\"'Yes, I am a veteran'\"",
      "For decades, Wells and other nurses who served in Vietnam tried to put the war out of their heads and get on with life at home. Some, like Barbisch, went back to the Army. Others, including Wells, returned to civilian medicine. Many nurses who had served together lost contact. Some received services through the VA, though Evans said it took years of fighting and appeals to have her post-traumatic stress disorder considered a disability by the agency.",
      "All of the women interviewed for this story said that their work during the war and the struggles they experienced afterward were something they rarely talked about, even with close friends and family.",
      "That changed in 1984 when Vietnam veteran Diane Carlson Evans co-founded the Vietnam Women's Memorial Foundation with two other former nurses. The foundation began lobbying Congress to erect a memorial honoring Vietnam nurses on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Congress approved the construction of the statue in 1988, and the memorial was dedicated on Veterans Day in 1993. Thousands of veterans, including Wells, participated in a march that culminated at the memorial, which shows three nurses caring for fallen soldiers.",
      "\"We marched down Constitution Avenue, and people were lining the streets shouting 'Welcome home, welcome home,'\" Wells said. \"One woman came up to me and said 'You saved my husband.' And that was great. It was amazing, it was uplifting.\"",
      "The legacy of the Vietnam nurses is now remembered with statewide celebrations and annual gatherings at the memorial. It's a welcome change from the silence and shame that accompanied their initial return home, Evans said.",
      "\"It really helped me come out and say 'Yes, I am a veteran, and I served in a war,'\" she said. \"I finally became very proud of what I did.\"",

Well, Shera LaPoint built this tree. And I'm like, is she related to our suspect? \u2026 I had no idea who she was.",

      "Det. Aaron Lewallen: Correct. Uh, so, that's what they did. \u2026 They surveilled his house \u2026 and then went and snatched a bag of trash \u2026 and sent it to me.",

And he says, \"I'm \u2013 I'm in the shower. I got to get dressed.\" And I told him, \"OK, you got 10 seconds.\" \u2026 Finally, I kicked the door in. The image will be with me forever.

      "Steve Braccini: Obviously the cause of death is strangulation. She's bound. She's held. There's something stuffed in her mouth, obviously to keep her from screaming.",
      "The police focused in on Cornelia's murder, but with almost 2,000 killings in New York in 1971 investigators could not close the case.",
      "Martha Bashford | Manhattan prosecutor: They had no real leads. We didn't have the forensic tools that we have \u2013 today \u2026 so they did what they could. \u2026And the case just went cold. And it stayed cold for 40 years.",
      "Rodney Alcala wasn't even a suspect. After the murder, he changed his name to John Berger and moved to New Hampshire. He landed a job as a counselor at an arts and drama camp for girls. There, he made a lasting impression on the campers.",

      "Detectives thought they were onto something when they found an important clue in her apartment.",
      "Melissa Mourges | Manhattan prosecutor: Ellen Hover \u2026 had marked on her calendar that she was going to see someone named John Berger on the date that she disappeared",
      "Remember, Alcala had been using the name John Berger. But at the time, the connection was never made.",
      "Melissa Mourges: Her body wasn't found until a year later, buried on the grounds of the Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester, near the Rockefeller Estate.",
      "Anita Feinberg: Until they actually found her, there was always a glimmer of hope \u2026 Once they found her body \u2014   that was it.",
      "Ellen's body was so decomposed police had to use dental records to identify her.",
      "Steve Braccini: Based on the autopsy, they declared it a homicide. \u2026there was a suspect in the murder. A fellow that they believe was the last person that she was seen with.",
      "Could that fellow have been Alcala?\u00a0 Ellen had written his alias, \"John Berger\" in her calendar.",
      "Alcala, meanwhile, had left New York and was on his meandering road trip back to California.",
      "Mary Ellen O'Toole | Former FBI profiler: \u00a0He was constantly in predatory mode. \u2026 that is behavior that involves hunting human beings and that's part of a serial sexual killer. \u2026That \u2026 is often as exciting as the actual homicide and sexual assault.",
      "At the same time Rodney Alcala was on the road, a 29-year-old woman from Texas, Christine Ruth Thornton, was traveling through the West with her boyfriend.",
      "Her sister, Kathy, was 11 years younger.",
      "Kathy Thornton: Chris was a free spirit kinda gal. So she always was up for anything.",
      "In the spring of 1977, Christine was heading to Montana with her boyfriend to pan for gold.\u00a0 And she had big news.",
      "Kathy Thornton: She let my mom know that she was going to be having a baby \u2026 And then nothing more was heard.",
      "Kathy Thornton immediately feared the worst. Christine and her boyfriend had a stormy relationship.",
      "Kathy Thornton: She had been abused by him. We knew that. \u2026I always thought that he had done something to her.",
      "Soon after Christine disappeared, Kathy Thornton began searching for answers. She undertook a systematic effort to track Christine and her boyfriend's whereabouts that would last almost 40 years \u2014   through marriage, motherhood, divorce and a career.",
      "Kathy Thornton contacted police departments, federal agencies and hospitals. She kept copies of every phone call and letter.",
      "Kathy Thornton: This is a letter I sent to the FBI.\u00a0 In 1989 I contacted the Department of Human Services \u2026 They say, \"A check at this address failed to reveal any contact with Christine Ruth Thornton.\" \u2026 the Social Security Administration \u2014  I contacted them asking if there was any employment record and there never had been an employment record.",
      "Kathy Thornton: I think the message was kind of clear. Everything was kind of \u2026\"We don't know.\" \"We have nothing.\" \"We can't help you.\" \u2026 Looking back through this, it was staring me in the face that \u2026 she was not alive.",

      "Bridget Wilvurt: We just lived to have fun. \u2026 Everybody could be complaining about being bored, and me and Robin would find ourselves doing cartwheels and back walkovers.",
      "The other love of Robin's life was her mom, Marianne.",
      "Marianne Connelly: She was probably the most loving child a mother could have. Everything she did, she did to please me.",
      "On June 20, 1979, Robin was going to start her first day of work answering phones at a ballet studio in exchange for lessons. But first, she planned to play on the beach for a few hours with Bridget.",
      "Bridget Wilvurt: I could definitely see a gentleman with dark hair. I mean he\u2014   he honed in on us, like, really like a \u2014   like a shark in the water, honing in on a seal. And he goes, \"Can I take your girls' pictures?\" \u2026 And Robin goes, \"Sure.\" And all of a sudden, out of nowhere, pops up Jackie Young, my neighbor. You know, she goes, \"Bridget, is everything OK? Are you girls alright?\" And man, he \u2014   he took that camera, turned his head down, and you could almost see like smoke coming off his dress shoes. He just \u2014   he was gone.",
      "Robin and Bridget turned to go back home.",
      "Bridget Wilvurt: And Robin had thrown her beach towel and everything into her bag, and she's like, \"Well, I'm going to get going.\" And I go, \"Well, take my bike and don't stop.\"",
      "That was the last time anyone saw Robin alive. Robin's ballet teacher called when she did not arrive for her lesson later that day.\u00a0 Her family immediately called 911.",
      "Marianne Connelly: It was probably the most horrifying time of all, you know, not knowing.",
      "Police continually questioned the one person they thought might know where Robin could've gone: her best friend, Bridget.",
      "Bridget Wilvurt: And I \u2014   I said \u2014   I go, \"it was the man, that man that took our picture.\"",
      "On July 2, 12 days after Robin last said goodbye to her friend and rode off on her bike, a fire crew found the body of a child.",

Why not?\" He said, \"Because it took us three days to identify her.\" I said, \"What's wrong with you people? How many little girls with long, blond hair disappear that it took you three days?\" He shook my shoulders and the tears were coming down his face, too. He says, \"There was no hair.\"",
      "A fire crew conducting routine fire prevention maintenance found Robin's remains in a remote location more than 40 miles from where she was last seen.",
      "Matt Murphy | Orange County Deputy D.A: There were 12 days for the animals to scavenge Robin's remains. By the time the fire crew actually found her body, she was just bones.",
      "The pressure was on to find the killer. Bridget's description resulted in this composite sketch, which was released to the media all over Southern California.",
      "Matt Murphy: His parole officer saw that and \u2014   and called the detectives and said, \"Look, there's a guy that used to be on my caseload. You really need to take a look at him. His name is Rodney Alcala.\"",
      "It had been nearly 11 years since Alcala had left 8-year-old Tali Shapiro for dead. But Alcala was easy to find this time. He lived with his mother in Monterey Park, a stone's throw from the mountains where Robin's remains were located.",
      "Matt Murphy: They learned that he had no alibi. That he \u2014   nobody could account for his whereabouts at that time.",
      "He was the perfect suspect. Rodney Alcala was arrested on July 24 and charged with the kidnap and murder of Robin Samsoe.",
      "Detective Pat Ellis said Huntington Beach Police got an unexpected tip when Alcala's sister came to visit her brother in jail. The conversation was being recorded.",
      "Det. Pat Ellis | Huntington Beach Police Dept.: At one point he mentions him having a storage locker in Seattle, Washington, that the cops don't know about.\u00a0 \u2026He says, \"Do me a favor, get the stuff out of there. \u2026get it \u2014 get it cleared out.\"",
      "But what Alcala didn't know was that police had found a receipt for the locker during a search of his home at the time of his arrest.",
      "Det. Pat Ellis: They beat her there \u2026 OK. And they get inside, and there's the mother lode.",
      "Matt Murphy: Hundreds if not thousands \u2026 of these different images. And there are dozens upon dozens of these young women that in the pictures clearly are in positions of supreme vulnerability with Rodney Alcala.",
      "Police learned Alcala had rented the storage facility and moved his belongings there nine days after Robin Samsoe's remains were discovered.",
      "Matt Murphy: Buried under all the stuff was this tiny little silk bag filled with earrings.",
      "Alcala claimed those were his earrings. But when police showed the jewelry to Robin's mother, she recognized a pair of gold ball studs that she said Robin often borrowed.",

      "Daniel Errasmouspe: And it almost clicked [snaps fingers] like that with him, and you could almost tell that he was reliving that day.",
      "Det. Jeff Sheaman: Eventually he took the photograph, set it on his lap and he used his index finger and just started tracing her body. Tracing her body for probably five minutes. And eventually he set the paper down flat and he started tapping \u2014   tapping on the photograph of Christine. Right over Christine's body tapping the photograph. \u00a0And eventually the tapping got louder, it got louder, he eventually looked at me, and at that point I honestly thought he would provide us more information about Christine.",

You're stupid\u2026\"\u00a0 And then when I asked him, \"Was she alive when you left her?\" And he said, \"yes.\"\u2026 \"She was alive when I left.\"",

      "There would be no extradition to Wyoming.",

    "story": [
      "Police detained several people Sunday for taking part in a demonstration in central Amsterdam that had been outlawed following violence targeting fans of an Israeli soccer club, a local broadcaster reported.",
      "Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema banned all demonstrations over the weekend in the aftermath of the grim scenes of youths on scooters and on foot attacking Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters on Thursday and Friday in what was widely condemned as a violent outburst of antisemitism in the Dutch capital.",
      "Israel's ambassador to the Netherlands said that 2,000 Israelis were brought home on special flights from Amsterdam over the past few days. The attacks left five Israeli soccer fans hospitalized, and came as anger grows over the war in the Gaza.",
      "Before the match against Ajax, Maccabi fans staged a pro-Israel demonstration in central Amsterdam where they chanted anti-Arab slogans on their way to the stadium. There were also reports of Maccabi fans starting fights.",
      "Video shows a group of fans chanting \"Let the Israeli army win\" and \"**** the Arabs\" while dressed in gear to support their team, CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reported. More footage shows the Palestinian flag being torn down from the second story of a building in the area where fans had gathered, by an individual who had climbed on top of the awning on the building's lower level to reach it.",
      "In the aftermath of the violent attacks against Israeli soccer fans that followed, one man who had traveled to the Netherlands for the Maccabi match told CBS News: \"It was very frightening. I saw people get beaten.\"",
      "Video on local broadcaster AT5 showed police detaining one man Sunday who was taking part in a small demonstration on the central Dam Square. The protesters yelled slogans including \"Free, free Palestine.\" AT5 reported that about 20 people were detained.",
      "Amsterdam Municipality said on X that police had begun arresting demonstrators who refused to leave the square, which is in the heart of the city's downtown shopping area and close to the historic canal network.",
      "Organizers of the protest went to court on Sunday morning seeking an injunction to allow the demonstration, but a judge upheld the ban imposed by the municipality.",
      "At the hearing, senior Amsterdam police officer Olivier Dutilh said that there were again incidents overnight targeting people thought to be Jewish, including some being ordered out of taxis and others being asked to produce their passports to confirm their nationality.",
      "Police launched a large-scale investigation Friday after gangs of youths conducted what Amsterdam's mayor called \"hit and run\" attacks on fans that were apparently inspired by calls on social media to target Jewish people. Five people were treated at hospitals and more than 60 suspects were arrested.",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rushed to the Netherlands on Friday and offered Israel's help in the police investigation. He met on Saturday with Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof and said in a statement that the attacks and demands to show passports \"were reminiscent of dark periods in history.\"",
      "On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the anti-Semitic attacks \"are not only a threat to Israel, they endanger the entire world.\"",
      "\"We will never allow the horrors of history to repeat themselves. We will never give in - neither to anti-Semitism nor to terrorism,\" he said.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 10:30:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy has long been used to combat compression sickness in divers. But at a hospital in Israel they're using it to address a very different malady - post-traumatic stress disorder - for military veterans and survivors of terror attacks.",
    "story": [
      "Idit Negrin would try anything to beat the trauma haunting her since attending the Nova Music Festival on October 7th, when Hamas massacred hundreds of civilians. \"We saw the terrorists, and they started shooting at us,\" she said. She ran for her life.",
      "Afterwards, \"I woke up every night, every night around 3 o'clock screaming and sweating and shaking. I think after a day, or two days after, I felt that I'm falling down, crying.\"",
      "We met her this summer as she was two-thirds of the way through her 60-session course of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). It's a treatment long used to combat compression sickness in divers, and wounds that will not heal. But at the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research, in Be'er Ya'akov, Israel, they're now also treating a very different malady: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.",
      "Negrin described her experiences with PTSD: \"You feel like you're going crazy. I call people and scream, 'There is a terror attack again!' And then you understand that you have no control of your brain.\"",
      "Negrin is trying to regain that control, along with about 650 other October 7th survivors suffering from PTSD who are being treated, for free, alongside military veterans at the Sagol Center \u2013 currently the largest hyperbaric center worldwide.",
      "Dr. Shai Efrati runs this clinic, where they're treating up to 350 patients a day, and are on the forefront of this sort of medicine. \"What we are doing is actually tricking the body,\" Efrati said. \"Hypoxia, lack of oxygen, is the most powerful trigger to induce all the repair mechanism cascade.\"",
      "Efrati says they're inducing repair mechanisms in the body and brain inside these pressurized chambers, where it feels like you're scuba diving down to 30 feet. Patients breathe in pure oxygen, which under such high-pressure conditions the body can absorb at up to 16 times the normal level. Then, masks are removed for five-minute intervals.",
      "Efrati said, \"The decline from very high back to the normal is being interpreted at the similar level as hypoxia, as lack of oxygen. That causes the body to trigger the stem cells, and for the first time even in humans, we can see generation of new neurons, generation of new blood vessels in the brain. And this is mind-blowing.\"",
      "The treatment has been described as \"unapproved\" and \"not proven.\" \"When we speak about hyperbaric oxygen therapy, this is how it should look like,\" Efrati said.",
      "\"You're saying there are a lot of frauds out there?\" asked Doane.",
      "\"Indeed. And this is not only not good, it can be even dangerous.\"",
      "Dr. Efrati is constantly experimenting with new ways to use this treatment. At his clinic near Tel Aviv, we got to see how they're catering hyperbaric medicine to athletes (\"If we can shorten the recovery period, you can push harder doing the exercises\"), and helping patients with brain injuries regain movement through the growth of new neurons and blood vessels in the brain.",
      "\"It's not that we are fixing his running,\" Efrati said about one athlete's performance. \"We are fixing the brain.\"",
      "They've published several studies, looking at PTSD in veterans. One, out today, found that 68% of patients showed significant improvement. Another reported that PTSD remission lasted at least two years, which is higher than other established treatments. \"We want to evaluate everything objectively,\" said Efrati.",
      "It's conclusive enough for the Israel Defense Forces, or IDF, to ask Efrati's team to stop testing and start treating. The doctor says that while you can always ask for more data, \"You see the evidence in front of you.\"",
      "Shachar Mizrhai was one of those IDF veterans referred in 2018 for the initial clinical trial. He was a soldier during a 2014 Israeli offensive in Gaza and was in an armored vehicle when it was ambushed. In the short term, he was thinking about survival; the suffering came later. \"I can't sleep at night,\" he said. \"In the moment I put [on] the uniform, I feel like I want to die. I smell blood. I smell war.\"",
      "He'd tried drugs, therapy and sleeping pills. He contemplated suicide. \"Nothing really helped to get back to life,\" he said. \"And I heard that this might be help, and maybe this is my last chance before I finish my life.\"",
      "Dr. Keren Doenyas-Barak, who heads the PTSD program at the Sagol Center, followed Mizrhai through his 60 sessions, and showed us his brain scans from June 2018, and March 2019, highlighting activation of areas used to effectively regulate emotion, or process information. The later brain scan images were lighting up; that wasn't happening before the treatment.",
      "\"Many people tend to look at PTSD as a psychological phenomenon, not as a biological phenomenon,\" Doenyas-Barak said. \"So, we treat PTSD very similar to other brain conditions.\"",
      "For Mizrhai, the treatment changed everything:\" \"It's the first time that I was feeling again. I begin to sleep at night, I was less afraid. It's make me feel alive again. \u2026 I was a dying man, and after this, I'm a living man.\"",
      "North Carolina Republican Congressman and medical doctor Greg Murphy said, \"If it's being offered in Israel and they're getting such good results, why the hell are we not offering it in the United States?\"",
      "That's a question Murphy \u2013 a member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs \u2013 is raising in the halls of Congress. One in 10 of his constituents is a veteran. \"I love our VA,\" he said. \"But we're not reaching a certain segment of our veterans if we're having 22 commit suicide every day. And if we're doing something and there is a treatment that has shown definitive results, I believe it's medical malpractice not to offer that to our veterans.\"",
      "In 2023 he introduced the Veterans' National Traumatic Injury Treatment Act. \"We just basically want the VA to do a pilot study within their own confines to see whether they show that hyperbaric oxygen works or not,\" he said.",
      "And what is he hearing from the VA? \"They just don't want to do anything; it's just hands up,\" he said. \"The reasons that we've heard is, 'Well, the results are mixed.' Fine. Look at the results in the last 15 years. Look at the studies in Israel. We are seeing an absolute effect in this, and other disorders, for Parkinson's, migraines, some even MS, neurological disorders.\"",
      "\"Sunday Morning\" requested an interview with the Department of Veterans Affairs, but they declined to comment.",
      "In Salt Lake City, Utah, we met Dr. Lin Weaver, who runs Hyperbaric Medicine at Intermountain Health. They treat about 20 patients a day, which puts into perspective the huge numbers - 350 daily \u2013 being treated in Israel. \u00a0He says they use their hyperbaric chambers for PTSD patients rarely, because it is expensive, but he has seen positive results: \"I've had patients that I've treated. Every one has got surprisingly better,\" Weaver said.",
      "But insurance companies say there is not enough proof it works for PTSD. And in the U.S., out-of-pocket costs soar above $50,000.",
      "\"What's necessary is like a drug trial,\" Weaver said. \"But these trials take years to accomplish. It all rests with, 'Is there an initiative? And is there a funding source?'\"",
      "Doane asked, \"But if doctors like you feel so strongly that this works, why isn't there enough push coming from folks like you to say, 'Prove this'?\"",
      "\"Well, believe me, we've tried,\" Weaver replied. \"I have submitted proposals to extramural funding agencies. So far, they haven't accepted them.\"",
      "Doane asked Dr. Efrati, \"You are out on the frontier here of medicine. Is there a danger in that?\"",
      "\"As a scientist, I will always tell you I need more study, I need more data,\" he replied. \"But as a physician, when I'm sitting in front of you looking at your eyes, you have a problem now. This is our job as a physician.\"",
      "Idit Negrin says this treatment is giving her hope she can move past that nightmare at the Nova Music Festival. She hopes, with the therapy, she can move on with her life.",
      "But she wears a reminder \u2013 a Nova necklace \u2013 while she gets treatment. \"I don't get her off my neck,\" she said.",
      "Her progress is motivation for Dr. Efrati to keep innovating, thinking about the future so his patients can process the past.",
      "Doane said, \"Some people are gonna listen to this and say it sounds too good to be true.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I know,\" said Negrin. \"But it's fact.\"",

    "story": [
      "Israeli strikes killed dozens of people on Sunday in Lebanon and the northern Gaza Strip, where the military has been waging a major offensive for more than a month that aid groups say has further worsened the humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave.",
      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon's Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said famine is imminent in the north or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as the deadline approaches for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel's ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas' attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups have long accused the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent. Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to an all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday's strike in Aalmat, some 40 kilometers (25 miles) north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",
      "Cease-fire talks mediated by the United States, Qatar and Egypt have repeatedly stalled since the start of the year, as have parallel efforts by the U.S. and others to halt the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "Qatar, which has served as a key mediator with Hamas, said over the weekend that it had suspended its efforts and would only resume them when \"the parties show their willingness and seriousness to end the brutal war and the ongoing suffering of civilians.\"",

      "The chief of the U.K. defense staff, Tony Radakin, told CBS News partner BBC that Moscow's troops suffered an average of 1,500 dead and wounded \"every single day,\" bringing their total losses in the war to 700,000.",
      "\"The enormous pain and suffering that the Russian nation is having to bear because of Putin's ambition,\" Radakin said.",
      "Russia's defense ministry said a total of 70 drones were shot down overnight in Russian territory, including 34 over Moscow's outskirts. Russia's aviation authority said flights were briefly grounded at major international airports including Sheremetyevo and Domodedovo.",
      "A woman in her 50s suffered burns to her face, neck and hands after drones sparked a blaze in her village southeast of Moscow, local Gov. Andrei Vorobyov reported.",
      "No one was hurt in Moscow itself, according to Sobyanin, although Russian channels on the messaging app Telegram carried eyewitness reports of drone debris setting fire to suburban homes.",
      "According to Radakin, ordinary Russians were paying \"an extraordinary price\" for the war, even as a grueling, monthslong Russian offensive in Ukraine's industrial east continues to eke out gains. He did not say how UK officials had calculated the Russian casualty figures.",
      "\"There is no doubt that Russia is making tactical, territorial gains and that is putting pressure on Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "But he said the losses were for \"tiny increments of land,\" and that Moscow's mounting defense and security spending was putting an increasing strain on the country.",
      "Radakin insisted that Ukraine's Western partners should stand by it for \"as long as it takes\" to beat back Russian aggression, even as allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have signaled that Kyiv may have to cede territory to seek peace.",
      "On Sunday, the Kremlin's official spokesman voiced cautious optimism about Trump's upcoming presidency, saying: \"At least, he talks about peace \u2026 he does not talk about confrontation.\"",
      "\"The signals are positive. Trump, during his election campaign, said that he perceives everything through deals, that he can make deals that will lead everyone toward peace,\" Dmitry Peskov told reporters at a briefing.",
      "\"He does not talk about a desire to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, and this favorably distinguishes him from the current (US) administration,\" Peskov said.",
      "U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that President Biden will urge Mr. Trump not to abandon Ukraine after taking office in January.",
      "The Republican president-elect and Mr. Biden are set to meet at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "While Sullivan did not specify what foreign policy topics the two would discuss, he said their conversation would feature the Ukraine-Russia war.",
      "\"President Biden will have the opportunity over the next 70 days to make the case to the Congress and to the incoming administration that the United States should not walk away from Ukraine, that walking away from Ukraine means more instability in Europe,\" Sullivan said.",
      "When asked if that means Mr. Biden will ask Congress to pass legislation to authorize more funding for Ukraine, Sullivan deferred.",
      "\"I'm not here to put forward a specific legislative proposal. President Biden will make the case that we do need ongoing resources for Ukraine beyond the end of his term,\" Sullivan said.",
      "Both Moscow and Kyiv have kept a tight lid on casualty figures since the start of the full-scale war despite regular reports of Russian forces taking huge losses following \"human wave\" attacks that aim to exhaust Ukrainian defenses.",
      "Meanwhile, Russia overnight launched a \"record\" 145 drones at Ukrainian territory, according to Ukraine's air force, 62 of which were shot down. A further 67 were \"lost\", the air force said, a likely reference to electronic jamming that caused the drones to veer off course.",
      "At least one person was injured as Russian drones struck residential areas in Ukraine's southern port of Odesa, local Gov. Oleh Kiper reported.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 13:51:00 -0500",
    "summary": "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a significant drop in production and rising costs.",
    "story": [
      "Two years of record-breaking drought have dealt a heavy blow to what is arguably the Amazon's most successful sustainable economy: the managed fishery for the giant pirarucu.",
      "In Brazil\u00b4s Amazonas state, almost 6,000 riverine dwellers authorized to fish have reported a sharp drop in production and rising costs. They are demanding aid from the federal government and debating how to adapt to climate change.",
      "Last year's catch totaled 70% of the government-authorized quota of 100,443 fish. This year could see an even steeper decline, since many communities still haven\u00b4t been able to fish. The season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.",
      "Pirarucu managed fishing began in the Amazon 25 years ago in the Mamiraua region and has since expanded. It helped the Amazon's largest fish escape risk of extinction and is now an important source of income for locals in 10 sustainable conservation units and eight Indigenous territories, where deforestation is close to zero.",
      "Unlike other aquatic species of the Amazon, such as river dolphins, the pirarucu \u2014 also known as arapaima \u2014 historically have proven resilient to drought and climate change. But low water levels are making it extremely difficult for fishers to transport their catch from remote lakes to major rivers and onto cities.",
      "It's a mammoth task. The pirarucu, which can weigh up to 200 kilograms (440 pounds), lives in large lakes that during flood season are often connected to major rivers. Fishing typically occurs when water levels begin to recede, making it easier to trap the fish and transport them out in small boats or canoes. In several areas, however, water levels dropped so quickly that this connection was cut off before fishing could begin.",
      "In the S\u00e3o Raimundo community in the Medio Jurua region, fishing is scheduled to start Saturday, a two-month delay \u2014 a common situation this season. As a result, Coletivo Pirarucu, an umbrella organization that represents 2,500 riverine and Indigenous families, has requested that the federal government extend fishing season until the end of January.",
      "Even in large rivers navigation has become problematic, raising costs and uncertainty among fishermen. It usually takes three to four days to transport fish from Carauari municipality \u2014 a major pirarucu producer \u2014 to Manaus, the Amazon\u00b4s largest city. During the peak of the drought, the trip increased to 10 days, and the freight price has doubled.",
      "Tough as pirarucu are, they are not immune to climate change, according to researcher Adalberto Luis Val from the National Institute for Amazonian Research. He says rising temperatures and severe droughts are exacerbating the \"death trio\" for all fish: warmer water, more CO2 and less oxygen.",
      "The pirarucu has evolved to breathe air but is far from invincible.",
      "\"No fish can regulate body temperature,\" Val said. \"Then there's water scarcity. As its level drops, you start to get a high amount of suspended material, leading to sludge buildup. It sticks to the gill area, blocking the processes that occur there.\"",
      "Fearing deteriorating conditions in the following decades, Coletivo Pirarucu contends that the fishermen should be entitled to compensation for losses caused by climate change. \"This crisis not only challenges the resilience of communities but also highlights the urgent need for climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies,\" the nonprofit stated in an open letter last week.",
      "In an e-mail response, James Bessa, a federal official overseeing pirarucu management, said that Ibama, Brazil\u00b4s environmental agency, is working with other public bodies and local fishing associations to reduce the impact of extreme events like droughts and floods. He said there are plans to start scientific studies and closer monitoring to provide insights into ways to support riverine and Indigenous communities in sustaining their fishing activities.",
      "Adevaldo Dias \u2014 a riverine leader who presides over the Chico Mendes Memorial, a nonprofit that assists traditional non-Indigenous communities \u2014 argues that adopting additional public policies to help the fishermen is a matter of climate justice.",
      "\"The Indigenous and riverine peoples have minimal impact on the environment,\" Dias said. \"We know that conserving the forest benefits both us and those outside it. And when extreme climate events occur, they are the most vulnerable.\"",

      "Considering Pennsylvania's battleground-state status, the popular first-term governor was viewed as a potential key for the Harris campaign to reach the coveted 270 electoral votes to lock up the election.

      "\"Our ask of President Trump in 2015 and 2016 will be the same ask of President Trump in 2025 or whenever that happens in this administration, that if there is a Supreme Court vacancy, no matter if it's a Sotomayor or it's a Justice Thomas, that the person that he nominates, the person that will be confirmed by the US Senate, will not be an abortion activist, they will be a constitutionalist, and they'll know what's in the Constitution and what's not in the Constitution.

      "Ever feel like navigating the internet is like walking through a digital minefield?",
      "With cybercriminals lurking around every corner, protecting your identity and finances can feel daunting. But what if I told you that a VPN could be your secret weapon?",
      "By masking your IP address and encrypting your data, a VPN makes you nearly invisible to online threats.",
      "Let\u2019s dive into how this powerful tool can safeguard your online activities and keep your financial transactions secure.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY A $500 GIFT CARD FOR THE HOLIDAYS",
      "A woman using a VPN on a tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts your internet connection, ensuring that your online activities remain private and secure. By routing your internet traffic through a secure server, VPNs mask your IP address, making it difficult for hackers and malicious entities to track your online behavior.",
      "A VPN being used on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "CAN YOU BYPASS VPN BLOCKS AND PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY?",
      "How VPNs work",
      "VPNs operate through two primary mechanisms \u2014 IP address masking and data encryption. When you connect to a VPN, it hides your real IP address by assigning you a new one from its server network, effectively preventing websites and cybercriminals from tracking your location or identifying you based on your IP address.",
      "Simultaneously, VPNs encrypt all data transmitted between your device and the internet, rendering it unreadable to anyone who might attempt to intercept it. This encryption process ensures that sensitive information, such as credit card details, remains confidential throughout your online activities. By combining these two powerful features, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your internet traffic, significantly enhancing your online privacy and security.",

      "Identity theft occurs when someone illegally obtains your personal information to commit fraud. This can lead to unauthorized transactions and damage to your credit status. So, how can a VPN prevent identity theft? By encrypting your internet connection, VPNs protect against data breaches and unauthorized access to personal information, especially on unsecured networks like public Wi-Fi. VPNs also prevent third parties from tracking your online activities, reducing the risk of personal data being harvested for malicious purposes.",

      "Using a VPN to reduce risks in online transactions",
      "Online transactions are vulnerable to interception by cybercriminals looking to steal financial information such as credit card numbers and banking credentials. A VPN can be used as a shield for financial data. VPNs ensure that all data exchanged during online transactions is encrypted, making it nearly impossible for hackers to access sensitive financial information. When using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often targeted by cybercriminals, a VPN provides an additional layer of security by encrypting all data transmissions.",
      "A woman using a VPN on her cell phone\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Practical tips for using VPNs effectively",

      "2. Use strong passwords:\u00a0Combine the use of a VPN with strong, unique passwords for each of your accounts to enhance security. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",

    "published": "Sat, 09 Nov 2024 10:00:11 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Kurt 'CyberGuy' Knutsson discusses OpenAI ending its safety task force, actress Scarlett Johansson claiming the company copied her voice and the growing popularity of the voice notes phone feature.",
      "ChatGPT is an amazing tool, and its developer, OpenAI, keeps adding new features from time to time.",
      "Recently, the company introduced a new memory feature in ChatGPT, which essentially enables it to remember things about you. For example, it can recall your age, gender, philosophical beliefs and pretty much anything else.",
      "These memories are meant to remain private, but a researcher recently demonstrated how ChatGPT's artificial intelligence memory features can be manipulated, raising questions about privacy and security.",

      "ChatGPT introduction screen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ChatGPT's Memory feature?",
      "ChatGPT\u2019s memory feature is designed to make the chatbot more personal to you. It remembers information that might be useful for future conversations and tailors responses based on that information, even if you open a different chat. For example, if you mention that you\u2019re vegetarian, the next time you ask for recipes, it will provide only vegetarian options.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "You can also train it to remember specific details about you, such as saying, \"Remember that I like to watch classic movies.\" In future interactions, it will tailor recommendations accordingly. You have control over ChatGPT\u2019s memory. You can reset it, clear specific memories or all memories, or turn this feature off entirely in your settings.",

      "WINDOWS FLAW LETS HACKERS SNEAK INTO YOUR PC OVER WI-FI",
      "The security vulnerability in ChatGPT",
      "As reported by\u00a0Arstechnica, security researcher Johann Rehberger found that it\u2019s possible to trick the AI into remembering false information through a method called indirect prompt injection. This means the AI can be manipulated into accepting instructions from unreliable sources like emails or blog posts.",
      "For instance, Rehberger demonstrated that he could trick ChatGPT into believing a certain user was 102 years old, lived in a fictional place called the Matrix and thought the Earth was flat. After the AI accepts this made-up information, it will carry it over to all future chats with that user. These false memories could be implanted by using tools like Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive to store files, upload images or even browse a site like Bing \u2014 all of which could be manipulated by a hacker.",
      "Rehberger submitted a follow-up report that included a proof of concept, demonstrating how he could exploit the flaw in the ChatGPT app for macOS. He showed that by tricking the AI into opening a web link containing a malicious image, he could make it send everything a user typed and all the AI's responses to a server he controlled. This meant that if an attacker could manipulate the AI in this way, they could monitor all conversations between the user and ChatGPT.",
      "Rehberger's proof-of-concept exploit demonstrated that the vulnerability could be used to exfiltrate all user input in perpetuity. The attack isn't possible through the ChatGPT web interface, thanks to an API OpenAI rolled out last year. However, it was still possible through the ChatGPT app for macOS.",
      "When Rehberger privately reported the finding to OpenAI in May, the company took it seriously and mitigated this issue by ensuring that the model doesn\u2019t follow any links generated within its own responses, like those involving memory and similar features.",

      "CYBER SCAMMERS USE AI TO MANIPULATE GOOGLE SEARCH RESULTS",
      "OpenAI\u2019s response",
      "After Rehberger shared his proof of concept, OpenAI engineers took action and released a patch to address this vulnerability. They released a new version of the ChatGPT macOS application (version 1.2024.247) that encrypts conversations and fixes the security flaw.",
      "So, while OpenAI has taken steps to address the immediate security flaw, there are still potential vulnerabilities related to memory manipulation and the need for ongoing vigilance in using AI tools with memory features. The incident underscores the evolving nature of security challenges in AI systems.",
      "The company says, \"It\u2019s important to note that prompt injection in large language models is an area of ongoing research. As new techniques emerge, we address them at the model layer via instruction hierarchy or application-layer defenses like the ones mentioned.\"",
      "How do I disable ChatGPT memory?",
      "If you're not cool with ChatGPT keeping stuff about you or the chance that it could let a bad actor access your data, you can just turn off this feature in the settings.",
      "Open the\u00a0ChatGPT app or website\u00a0on your computer or smartphone.Click on the\u00a0profile icon in the top right corner of the screen.Go to Settings and then select Personalization.Switch the Memory option off, and you\u2019re all set.",

      "As AI technologies like ChatGPT become more prevalent, it's crucial to adhere to cybersecurity best practices to protect your personal information. Here are some tips for enhancing your cybersecurity:",
      "1. Regularly review privacy settings:\u00a0Stay informed about what data is being collected. Periodically check and adjust privacy settings on AI platforms like ChatGPT and others to ensure you\u2019re only sharing information you\u2019re comfortable with.",
      "2. Be cautious about sharing sensitive information:\u00a0Less is more when it comes to personal data. Avoid disclosing sensitive details such as your full name, address, or financial information in conversations with AI.",
      "3. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create passwords that are at least 12 characters long, combining letters, numbers, and symbols, and avoid reusing them across different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your ChatGPT and other AI accounts.\u00a0By requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code, you significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.",
      "5. Keep software and applications up to date:\u00a0Stay ahead of vulnerabilities.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against newly discovered threats, so enable automatic updates whenever possible.",
      "6. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0 In an age where AI is everywhere, protecting your data from cyber threats is more important than ever. Adding strong antivirus software to your devices adds a critical layer of protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "7. Regularly monitor your accounts:\u00a0Catch issues early. Frequently check bank statements and online accounts for any unusual activity, which can help you identify potential\u00a0breaches quickly.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "As AI tools like ChatGPT get smarter and more personal, it's pretty interesting to think about how they can tailor conversations to us. But, as Johann Rehberger\u2019s findings remind us, there are some real risks involved, especially when it comes to privacy and security. While OpenAI is able to mitigate these issues as they arise, it also shows that we need to keep a close eye on how these features work. It's all about finding that sweet spot between innovation and keeping our data safe.",

      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents.

      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",

They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware.

      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

    "story": [
      "He'd make the benefits tax-free, but the costs could be significant.",
      "With most of your life attached to these nine numbers, your Social Security number (SSN) is incredibly important to keep safe. That\u2019s why it is crucial to pay attention to signs that your SSN may have been compromised. While preventing the misuse of your SSN is paramount, there are action steps you can take if it does fall into the wrong hands.",

      "There are steps you can take if your Social Security number falls into the wrong hands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top signs someone might be using your Social Security number",
      "Are you concerned that your Social Security number may have gotten into the wrong hands? Check below to see if you are experiencing any of these signs:",
      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",
      "You can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "BEWARE OF THIS SOCIAL SECURITY SCAM BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU",
      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",
      "Beware of new notices from the IRS or other governmental agencies. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Top ways to keep your Social Security number safe",
      "Go to the official Social Security Administration website to create an account,\u00a0if you haven\u2019t already.",
      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",
      "Some records that contain your Social Security number are important to keep on hand, such as income tax filings. If they are kept digitally, encrypt and or password-protect the document or folder, especially if it is uploaded to the cloud. Keep offline documents with SSNs in a safe or shred instead of throwing them away.",
      "Remember you (usually) only get one SSN in a lifetime, it is important to safeguard that data with your \"life.\"",
      "Removing your personal information from the internet, given the increasing privacy concerns about artificial intelligence, is essential. Data removal services can help protect your Social Security number by systematically erasing your details from websites, thus reducing the risk of identity theft.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The attacks of Oct. 7 heightened that feeling of hate even further. With all the anti-Israel activity in the city over the past year, Reich reports that she is \"always worried if my husband goes downtown,\" and that she doesn\u2019t \"go to Northwestern anymore, to walk around their lakefront area.\"",

      "Currently, both chambers of Congress enter \"pro forma\" sessions, even when the House and the Senate are out of town, as a tactic to block the president from bypassing confirmation votes.",
      "The Supreme Court rebuked President Barack Obama when\u00a0he\u00a0made recess appointments, ruling 9-0 that he made them during a three-day break and that recesses are technically longer than that. The ruling gave the Senate more power to thwart such appointments in the future.",
      "In 2020, during the throes of the Covid pandemic, Trump threatened to unilaterally adjourn Congress so he could make recess appointments, but the threat never materialized.",
      "Trump's post Sunday is his first time he has weighed into the race to replace Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Republicans' de facto leader in the Senate.",
      "GOP Sens. John Cornyn of Texas, Rick Scott of Florida and John Thune of South Dakota, the minority whip, are running to replace him.",
      "Scott quickly weighed Sunday, writing on X that he agrees with Trump about recess appointments.",
      "\"100% agree. I will do whatever it takes to get your nominations through as quickly as possible,\" Scott wrote.",
      "Cornyn wrote on X that it is \u201cunacceptable\u201d for Senate Democrats to block Trump appointments.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution expressly confers the power on the President to make recess appointments,\u201d he wrote in the post. \u201cArticle II, Section 2, Clause 3: The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.\u201d",
      "Thune said members of the Senate must act \"quickly and decisively\" on Trump appointments.",
      "\u201cWe must act quickly and decisively to get the president\u2019s nominees in place as soon as possible, & all options are on the table to make that happen, including recess appointments. We cannot let Schumer and Senate Dems block the will of the American people,\" he wrote on X.",
      "The race to succeed McConnell has heated up since Election Day, with rank-and-file GOP senators publicly endorsing their picks.",
      "Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, Marco Rubio of Florida and Bill Hagerty of Tennessee have all endorsed Scott.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has endorsed Cornyn.",
      "On Thursday, Thune urged Trump not to endorse in the race, telling CNBC in an interview, \u201cObviously, if he wants to, he could exert a considerable amount of influence on that, but honestly, I think my preference would be, and I think it\u2019s probably in his best interest, to stay out of that.\"",
      "Scott told Trump in May that he would run to succeed McConnell and asked for his endorsement, a source familiar with the call told NBC News.",
      "Cornyn, Scott and Thune will meet Tuesday evening at a candidates forum organized by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. On Wednesday morning, just hours before Trump meets with President Joe Biden at the White House, senators will vote for a new majority leader by secret ballot.",
      "In the second part of his Truth Social post Sunday, Trump called on Democrats not to confirm any additional judicial nominees before the start of the next congressional session.",
      "\"Additionally, no Judges should be approved during this period of time because the Democrats are looking to ram through their Judges as the Republicans fight over\u00a0Leadership. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THANK YOU!\" Trump wrote, suggesting Republicans should stop Democrats from confirming judges during the lame duck session.",
      "That would work only if Republicans slow-walk the process. They cannot unilaterally stop Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., from putting nominees on the floor."

      "Not wanting to escalate a bad situation, she said nothing, but the troubling encounter is emblematic of the hostility she\u2019s faced as a recognizable and vocal critic of Trump. Now, with Trump returning to the White House, she is beset by newfound fears that he, his appointees or supporters could try to punish her for speaking out.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll be targeted by him and a lot of people in his circle,\u201d Troye said in an interview. \u201cThey very much know who I am. And I\u2019m concerned for my family.\u201d",
      "She has plenty of company. For some who\u2019ve run afoul of Trump, the election results have sparked fresh worries that he may enter office looking for retribution.",
      "He\u2019s been out of power for nearly four years, airing grievances over how he believes he\u2019s been mistreated by law enforcement, but on Jan. 20 he\u2019ll be sworn in with a panoply of governmental powers at his disposal. He\u2019s made no secret of who he believes has wronged him, and as president, he could upend their lives through investigations, tax audits or courts-martial if he chose.",
      "During the campaign, Trump has made different statements about whether he might target people who\u2019ve upset him. What he\u2019s said can be construed in different ways. He gave a speech last year hours after he was charged with mishandling classified documents and said that if elected, he would \u201cappoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the United States of America: Joe Biden and the entire Biden crime family.\u201d",
      "In February, he dismissed any concerns that he might want vengeance, saying: \u201cMy revenge will be success.\u201d",
      "He told Fox News last month in an exchange about weaponizing government against political foes: \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that. That\u2019s a bad thing for the country. I don\u2019t want to do that. I haven\u2019t said that I would. But they have done it.\u201d",
      "In the same interview, he described Democratic Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, both of California, as the \u201cenemy from within.\u201d",
      "As for Jack Smith, the special prosecutor who has been investigating Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents and his attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat, Trump said last month he should be \u201cthrown out of the country.\u201d (A spokesperson for Smith declined to comment).",
      "Rep. Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally in Congress, said he doesn\u2019t expect any of the prosecutors to face reprisals over Trump investigations.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of that\u2019s going to happen because we\u2019re the party who\u2019s against political prosecution,\u201d Jordan said Sunday on CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re the party who\u2019s against going after your opponents using lawfare.\u201d",
      "None of this has a precise parallel in the modern era. President Richard Nixon had his enemies, but tended to rail against them in private.",
      "\u201cThe main thing is, the Post is going to have damnable, damnable problems out of this one,\u201d Nixon told his aides in 1972, complaining about The Washington Post\u2019s coverage. \u201cWell, the game has to be played awfully rough.\u201d",
      "Interviews with 10 people \u2014 those who worked in the first Trump administration, lawmakers and critics, among others \u2014 reveal varying levels of distress.",
      "A private attorney, Mark Zaid, said he has consulted with clients about how they can best protect themselves in a second Trump administration. He said he has advised some to leave the country before Trump is sworn in and live abroad until they have a clear sense of whether he is bent on retaliation.",

They had transferred Cohen from home detention to prison, a move that was \u201cretaliatory in response to Cohen desiring to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book critical of the President [Trump] and to discuss the book on social media,\u201d Judge Alvin Hellerstein wrote. He ordered Cohen returned to confinement in his Manhattan apartment.",

      "Incoming Vice President JD Vance suggested last month that the Trump administration would pull the security clearances of the 51 people with national security experience who signed a letter before the 2020 election questioning the authenticity of emails found on a laptop belonging to Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter.",

      "Larry Pfeiffer, former chief of staff at the CIA who co-signed the letter, said: \u201cThere are colleagues of mine on that list who have clearances because they\u2019re active members of companies that do business inside the intelligence community, and they will likely lose their post-government livelihoods if their clearances are pulled.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be, in our view, absolutely unprecedented to pull peoples\u2019 clearances for some opinion that they espouse,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump will assume office with a mandate from voters and minimal restraints. Republicans will take control of the Senate and are better positioned than Democrats to run the House given the election results that are still coming in, lifting a potential check on executive power.",
      "Separately, a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year imbued the president with sweeping immunity, removing a deterrent to possible retaliatory action.",
      "Because Trump is limited to one term, public opinion won\u2019t be the brake that it has been for presidents facing re-election.",
      "Though Trump has at times offered assurances that he wouldn\u2019t try to avenge the wrongs he says he\u2019s suffered, some of his critics aren\u2019t convinced he means it.",

      "\u201cA lot of people say that\u2019s what should happen if you want to know the truth,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Asked if he would \u201clook at his political enemies\u201d when back in office, Trump said: \u201cNo, I want to make this the most successful country in the world. That\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d",
      "Schiff\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. After Trump referred to him as an \u201cenemy\u201d living inside the country, Schiff posted on social media that \u201cthere is no justification for such dictatorial behavior. Except dictatorial ambition.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Pelosi pointed to her comments in a Los Angeles Times article before the election, in which she said that if Trump were to win, \u201cnot just us, but many other people would be targeted.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anyone begins to truly use the criminal justice system or other aspects of the government to target their enemies, then we are nothing but a banana republic,\u201d said Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who before entering office was the lead counsel in Trump\u2019s first impeachment case. \u201cThe response you\u2019ll get from Republicans is, \u2018That\u2019s what Joe Biden did.\u2019 And I would ask any right-thinking person to actually say that Joe Biden weaponized the Department of Justice when his Department of Justice convicted his own son.\u201d",
      "Not wanting to call attention to themselves or antagonize Trump, some who\u2019ve been publicly critical in the past are staying silent for now.",
      "One former Trump White House official who has publicly spoken against Trump described feeling \u201cscared\u201d and declined to let their name be used.",
      "Another ex-Trump administration official who has publicly derided Trump said that while they\u2019re remaining in the U.S., others are \u201cconferring with counsel and trying to figure things out like what are the immigration laws and policies in places they might consider going.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unreal,\u201d this person added. \u201cIt\u2019s unreal that in this day and age in this country, we\u2019re having these thoughts and concerns.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just Trump and his circle that frighten those who\u2019ve spoken out; it\u2019s also his following. Two days after the election, someone wrote in reply to one of Troye\u2019s posts on X: \u201cYou too should prepare for prison. Trump owns your pathetic ass.\u201d",
      "Michael Fanone, the former D.C. police officer who was attacked on Jan. 6 and became a vocal critic of Trump since that time, called him an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d earlier this year. Hours later, his 78-year-old mother was \u201cswatted,\u201d with a SWAT team showing up at her home while she was in her nightgown because of a false report.",
      "Now, Fanone says he is hunkering down in his Virginia mountain-area home for fear that Trump could weaponize the police.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll die right here on my f------ house,\u201d he told The Washington Post. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in some \u2018Apprentice\u2019 f------ military tribunal.\u201d",
      "Zaid represented a whistleblower in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial and has also defended some of the 51 people who co-signed the Hunter Biden letter. In 2019, Trump called him a \u201csleazeball,\u201d citing some anti-Trump tweets he had posted two years earlier.",
      "He, too, is uneasy about what\u2019s to come.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re certainly concerned that the new White House will make it difficult for us to represent federal employees fairly \u2014 (meaning) that they would not retaliate against our clients,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that if they wanted, they can make our lives difficult and interfere with anyone\u2019s law practice, just by saying they\u2019re not going to respond to things we do.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Trump\u2019s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "If Trump or his political appointees were to pursue legal retribution, career prosecutors may not find it easy to bring such cases, nor might they be willing to go along.",
      "John Bolton, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, who wrote a book disparaging Trump\u2019s methods, said in an interview: \u201cI assume there\u2019s a long retribution list and I\u2019m on it.\u201d",
      "He sketched out what might happen if, hypothetically, Trump ordered the Justice Department to open an investigation into a political foe that had no legal basis.",
      "Eventually, the request would fall from political appointees to career Justice Department prosecutors. What these lawyers choose to do is \u201cwhen the rubber meets the road,\u201d said Bolton, a former Justice Department official in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cDoes the career prosecutor say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do that\u2019? Do they fire him? Does he resign? When does that become public? Fifteen seconds later is the answer to that. And then we have a crisis.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s appointments may offer the earliest clues as to how he\u2019ll use the government\u2019s vast powers. Will he fill posts with loyalists who want only to please him and indulge his instincts, or will he pick people for whom the rule of law remains a guidepost?",
      "At least one Democrat was heartened by Trump\u2019s selection of Susie Wiles, daughter of the late NFL football announcer Pat Summerall, as his White House chief of staff.",
      "\u201cShe is brilliant, tough, strategic,\u201d Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., wrote on X. \u201cShe will serve the country well.\u201d",
      "For now, others who may have reason to fear Trump\u2019s return are watching and waiting to see what happens.",
      "Aquilino Gonell, a former U.S. Capitol police sergeant who was assaulted by Trump supporters on Jan. 6 and who later testified before the House committee investigating the riot, said: \u201cYes, I have to be vigilant. I mean, I have a family to take care of.\u201d",
      "Gonell sustained injuries in the Jan. 6 attack that forced him to retire in 2022. He campaigned for Democrat Kamala Harris in the presidential race and has been vocal about what he sees as Trump\u2019s failings as his supporters flooded the Capitol that day and interfered with the transfer of power.",

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Comparing 2020 election results to 2024, Trump\u2019s margin increased more in counties with the most difficult housing markets.",
    "story": [
      "America\u2019s housing crisis isn\u2019t just reshaping where Americans live \u2014 experts say it\u2019s reshaping how some vote.",
      "Many of the counties that swung most dramatically toward Donald Trump on Election Day were also among America\u2019s toughest housing markets, according to an analysis of election returns and the NBC News Home Buyer Index. And while voters picked Trump for a variety of reasons, these counties shifted further right than much of the rest of the country.",
      "Across the country Tuesday, counties moved toward Trump by a median of 3.1 percentage points compared to the 2020 election. But in the top 10% of counties ranked most difficult for buying a home, the median shift was 4.5 percentage points. And nearly a third of these counties settled their races by just over a point, meaning real estate woes turned these counties into political flash points.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t just Republican counties voting even more strongly for Republicans. Multiple battleground states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania \u2014\u00a0were home to dozens of these struggling markets.",
      "\u201cThis was economics,\u201d said Robert Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, who added that the financial challenges Americans face could have cost Democrats the election.",
      "\u201cVoters were feeling economic hardship to an extent that was not fully appreciated by the Democrats, by the administration \u2014 the Harris campaign picked up on it, but it was too little, too late,\u201d Shapiro said. \u201cAnd the price of housing figures into this heavily.\u201d",
      "The Home Buyer Index tracks the difficulty potential homebuyers face in local housing markets across hundreds of America\u2019s counties and nationwide on a scale of 0 to 100. In October, the nationwide index stood at a very difficult 80.6. But there are several counties where the difficulty is even higher.",
      "In Passaic County, New Jersey, with a population of more than 500,000, voters flipped for Trump by nearly 19 percentage points. It\u2019s also one of the toughest markets in America. In Passaic, where this year\u2019s average Home Buyer Index score of 85.5 puts it among the 20 most difficult markets in the nation, the median home costs $535,000. That amount is nearly double what it was in 2019, and a price tag no longer within the reach of the median family income there.",
      "Nearby in Pennsylvania, Northampton County \u2014 which narrowly tipped red with a shift of 3 percentage points \u2014 has a similar story. In Northampton, rising home prices and tough competition have driven homebuyer anxiety. Its average index score for 2024 is 79.0, putting it among the 125 most difficult markets. Since 2019, the median home price has risen roughly 75% and market inventory is averaging about a third of what it used to be.",
      "But not all high-challenge housing counties swung toward Trump.",
      "Out on Colorado\u2019s Western Slope, Mesa County did the reverse \u2014 moving more than 5 points to the left. While still firmly in Trump\u2019s camp, the red county has nudged toward blue the past two elections, as turnout increased and the Democratic candidate won more of the incoming voters. Since 2020, the housing market in Mesa has ratcheted up to one of the most competitive in the country, with a Competition Index at or near the maximum for most of 2024.",
      "This economic pain is a kind that cuts through demographic lines.",
      "\u201cHousing prices are a big part of the inflation story, especially the most persistent and severe parts of the inflation story,\u201d said Bernard Fraga, a professor specializing in voter turnout at Emory University. \u201cSo you can\u2019t separate out the price of housing from voters\u2019 general concerns about the state of the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s biggest advantage was that he represented change, Fraga said, while for many Harris represented basically a continuation of the economy that President Joe Biden put into place.",
      "\u201cIn the minds of many,\u201d Fraga said, \u201cthere was such a strong dissonance between Democrats saying \u2018you\u2019re so much better off than you were four years ago\u2019 and the experience of everyday Americans.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 The Chiefs blocked Broncos kicker Wil Lutz\u2019s 35-yard field goal attempt as time expired on Sunday, and Kansas City escaped with a 16-14 victory over the Broncos to extend\u00a0its winning streak to 15 games\u00a0dating to last season.",
      "The Chiefs had taken the lead on Harrison Butker\u2019s field goal with 5:57 remaining, but Bo Nix and the Broncos converted on a trio of third downs while marching right back down field. They proceeded to set up Lutz for the winner, but Leo Chenal was given credit for coming up the middle amid a big push by the Kansas City defensive line to get his hand on the kick.",
      "Patrick Mahomes finished with 266 yards passing and a touchdown for Kansas City, which became only the fifth team to follow up a Super Bowl triumph by winning its first nine games. That also matches the best start to a season in franchise history.",
      "The Chiefs\u2019 winning streak dating to last season is the longest in the NFL since the Packers won 19 in a row from 2010-11.",
      "Travis Kelce had eight catches for 64 yards and a touchdown for Kansas City. DeAndre Hopkins caught four passes for 56 yards, and Kareem Hunt was held to 35 yards rushing but also caught seven passes for 65 yards.",
      "Nix finished with 215 yards passing and two touchdowns for the Broncos (5-5). Courtland Sutton had six catches for 60 yards and a score, and his 13-yard reception on third-and-6 with 1:45 left gave Denver a chance to kick as time expired.",
      "The Broncos stunned the Chiefs a year ago, forcing five turnovers in a 21-9 win at Denver that ended a 16-game losing streak in the series. And they clearly had the same intention in mind as the AFC West rivals met again Sunday.",
      "Their defense harassed Mahomes throughout the first half, particularly when an injury to Wanya Morris forced rookie left tackle Kingsley Suamataia into the game. And the Broncos capitalized on offense with two long scoring drives, the first ending with Nix finding Devaughn Vele wide open and the second with Sutton\u2019s 32-yard TD catch for a 14-3 lead.",
      "It was Mahomes who got the Chiefs on track, going 7 for 7 for 62 yards on the ensuing drive. When it looked like it stalled at the Denver 2, Chiefs coach Andy Reid went for it on fourth down, and Mahomes hit Kelce for the score.",
      "The Chiefs still trailed 14-10 at the break \u2014 so they had Denver right where they wanted them.",
      "Unflappable in winning its last eight when trailing in the second half, Kansas City closed within 14-13 on Butker\u2019s chip-shot field goal late in the third quarter. The Chiefs defense then forced back-to-back punts, and Mahomes and the offense drove to the Denver 2, where Butker added the go-ahead kick with just under six minutes remaining."

      "His day, however, got off to an inauspicious start. Here\u2019s how Rizzi himself described it:",

But then the team dropped its next seven games, including a 23-22 loss to the Carolina Panthers in Week 9.

      "Rizzi, unlike in the morning, also had some luck on his side, as Atlanta missed three field goals.",
      "New Orleans improved to 3-7 but still remains three games behind Atlanta for first place in the NFC South. The Saints will play the Cleveland Browns in Week 11.",
      "The Falcons fell to 6-4, but they are still the only team in their division over .500. Next up on Atlanta\u2019s schedule are the Denver Broncos."

    "published": "Sun, 10 Nov 2024 13:00:41 GMT",
    "summary": "More states are looking to ban phones during class.",
    "story": [
      "More than 200,000 students at one of the largest school districts in the nation have started the school year with a major change: no cellphone use allowed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve noticed such a big difference in the classroom. Students talk more. They actually do their work,\u201d Dominique Mayorga, a teacher who installed a sleeve in her classroom that can hold around 30 phones, said.",
      "Over the summer, Florida\u2019s Broward County Public Schools made the decision to ban students from using cellphones and other communication devices for the entire school day. Students are to keep phones off or in airplane mode the entire day and relinquish them to designated areas, like Mayorga's sleeve, during class, or face disciplinary action. The new policy, which went into effect in August, quickly sparked debate among parents, students, teachers and administrators.",
      "Critics of the ban have raised safety concerns, arguing it could hamper communication during an emergency. It's a particularly sensitive topic in Broward County after the 2018 Parkland shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, which is in the district.",
      "Response to the ban was quick. Parents flooded the comments of posts the district made on X and Instagram announcing the changes, circulating a change.org petition asking for the school to reverse the ban. It has garnered over 25,000 signatures.",
      "Carline Dumoulin, a mother of two students at Broward\u2019s Cypress Bay High School, is one of those signatories. Cellphones, she said, are \u201cthe way for us to communicate if there\u2019s any type of problems going on at school, and I don\u2019t need to go into the details \u2014 we know what\u2019s happened before.\u201d",
      "Students \u201cneed to be able to communicate with the outside world, with their parents or their guardians, to let them know that there\u2019s a problem,\u201d Dumoulin added.",
      "For many at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, cellphones were an important resource during the shooting. Some students used their devices to text loved ones, post live updates or even take pictures and videos, some of which would later be shown at the gunman\u2019s trial, where he was sentenced to life in prison for killing 17 students and faculty at the school.",
      "Broward County school board member Lori Alhadeff said she understands parents\u2019 safety concerns all too well: She lost her 14-year-old daughter Alyssa in the Parkland shooting.",
      "But Alhadeff supports the ban, explaining that emergency protocols are in place to help alleviate those concerns. In schoolwide emergencies, for example, district policy says students will be able to access their devices from the place that their teacher has designated.",
      "\u201cOn Feb. 14 [of 2018], all I wanted to do was hear from Alyssa. I texted Alyssa during that day, told Alyssa to run and hide, that help was on the way,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI know it\u2019s scary, but we have and will communicate with parents as soon as possible to let them know that their kids are safe.\u201d",
      "But Alhadeff said she\u2019s open to adjusting the rules as time goes on. \u201cI talked to students. I heard them loud and clear that they would like to use their phone during lunch and transition times and study halls,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m absolutely open to the conversation.\u201d",
      "A full ban",
      "The cellphone ban was put in place to adhere to a new law signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in May 2023. The law restricts the use of all wireless communication devices in public school classrooms, saying that they must be powered off during instructional time and placed in an area designated by the teacher.",
      "Florida\u2019s law is one of the first of its kind to go into effect in the U.S., but similar legislation has spread across the country, with at least 15 states including Indiana and Ohio adopting similar policies against cellphone use in public school classrooms. The most recent state to adopt restrictions was California, passing its Phone-Free Schools Act on Sept. 23.",
      "Broward County took the Florida bill a step further and banned the use of devices for the entire school day.",
      "Broward County school board member Debra Hixon was present at the meeting where the rule was approved, but had left before the vote. She said she would have voted against it because it should have allowed students to use their phones during lunch, as it is \u201ctheir time.\u201d",
      "But during her time at the meeting, Hixon said, the board agreed to allow students to leave their phones on airplane mode so they could have quick access in case of emergency. Hixon, who lost her husband, Chris, in the Parkland shooting, said complaints and concerns have \u201creally leveled off\u201d and that parents understand cellphones will be easily accessible to students when needed.",
      "On its website, Broward County nods to some concerns that inspired the legislation, including cyberbullying. Last year, a video of several students fighting at West Broward High School circulated online, gaining thousands of views on X. Following the fight, the school\u2019s principal sent a message to parents warning that \u201cstudents who videotape\u201d fights were also at risk of disciplinary action.",
      "Board member Allen Zeman is a strong proponent of maintaining the cellphone ban for the entire day. He emphasized the negative impact cellphones can have on students, including how they\u2019ve worsened mental health and caused distractions.",
      "\u201cIf nobody has social media, if nobody has an ability to \u2018like you\u2019 or to do any kind of action, or to share something with you that everyone else has seen, so you have to see it too, your day is better,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cYou can breathe. You can take a little longer to enjoy a lecture or to sit on the grass and enjoy your lunch, rather than be buried in your cellphone. That\u2019s why Broward County did it from bell to bell, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s important that it\u2019s enforced for everybody.\u201d",
      "Zeman also emphasized the alarming decrease in literacy rates in public schools. A report by the National Assessment of Educational Progress found that reading test scores have been declining since 1992.",
      "Max Schachter, who lost his son Alex in the Parkland shooting and has since become an advocate for safe schools, also said he is in full support of the cellphone restrictions and believes that the safety protocols will protect students even when they are without their devices. He added that in emergency situations, students should focus on following safety procedures, not be on their phones.",
      "\u201cDuring an emergency, kids should not be contacting their parents. Parents are not going to be able to do anything to help their children anyway,\u201d Schachter said.",
      "The state has also taken steps to address school safety. Following the 2018 shooting, Florida passed school safety legislation creating Alyssa\u2019s Alert, which requires schools to install a mobile alert system that will call the authorities in an emergency, as well as the Marjory Stone Douglas High School Public Safety Act, which increased school security personnel and surveillance in public schools. The district has also invested over $2 million in installing metal detectors in its schools.",
      "Classrooms and hallways",
      "Keeping students off their phones when outside of classrooms has proven hard to enforce.",
      "Two teachers and a student who spoke to NBC News said that inside the classroom, the rules have been in full force, but passing periods and lunch are where things get murky. A spokesperson said the district has been collecting survey data that will be reviewed in November to assess how the ban has been going.",
      "Leo Jimenez, a science teacher at Cooper City High School, said enforcement during class has been going well and that he has seen improvement in his students\u2019 focus during class time. He already had rules regarding cellphone use in his classroom before the ban, he added, and the district rule has helped back him up.",
      "However, during lunch and passing periods, Jimenez said, it\u2019s been rare to see enforcement, and he doesn\u2019t believe many other schools have been enforcing it during those times either.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a battle that I don\u2019t think anybody wants to fight.\u201d Jimenez said.",
      "Board member Hixon said that she has been hearing similar things about enforcement of the rules.",
      "\u201cIn the hallways, they\u2019re using it, and they\u2019re just not really doing it to the fidelity of the law,\u201d Hixon said. \u201cAgain, my concern [is] with the lunchtime restriction, because who\u2019s supposed to be monitoring and enforcing that?\u201d",
      "However, board member Zeman has been hearing different feedback.",
      "\u201cThe enforcement has been no issue in Broward County Schools,\u201d Zeman said. \u201cWhere we want to enforce the rules, we do a very good job of it, as do most school districts across the country.\u201d",
      "The solution that many teachers have found to get students off their phones during class are cellphone pocket sleeves. Jimenez said he has installed a sleeve in his classroom, like Mayorga.",
      "Marlena, a sophomore at South Broward High School, said she\u2019s seen virtually no enforcement of the rules during lunch and passing periods.",
      "\u201cIf they did enforce it during their lunch and passing period, I wouldn\u2019t want that,\u201d Marlena said.",
      "Room for improvement",
      "Mayorga, the art teacher, said she believes there\u2019s still room for improvement in enforcing the new rules, pointing to Orange County Public Schools, another school district in Florida that has implemented a similar policy to Broward\u2019s. Mayorga said having resources such as additional school personnel to enforce the ban during lunch and passing periods, as she said Orange County has done, could help its efficacy. A Broward County Public Schools spokesperson said a variety of staff members \u2014 including administrators, security personnel and teachers \u2014 are tasked with supervising the use of cellphones in the hallways and in lunchrooms, but the number of staff assigned to the role is determined by each school.",
      "In Broward County, the conversation around the ban is set to continue. A district spokesperson said the board would be discussing the survey results and feedback on the ban.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we need to make sure that the end user, which is our students, that they\u2019re happy and that the policy is being followed with fidelity,\u201d Alhadeff said. \u201cI think it is a very difficult thing to have teachers constantly be phone watchdogs, and so I do believe that the board is open to some solutions that might make everybody happy.\u201d"

      "In both women and men, it\u2019s normal for testosterone levels to drop with age \u2014 starting at about age 30 in men and around 40 in women. The decline doesn\u2019t mean that it necessarily needs to be replaced, either for health or longevity.",
      "Levels for what is considered normal can vary depending on the lab, and just because levels are low, that does not necessarily mean testosterone should be started. Doctors use a combination of symptoms and blood work in deciding whom to treat.",
      "If a patient does have symptoms of \u201clow T\u201d \u2014 including depression, lethargy and low sex drive \u2014 doctors typically gauge levels with a blood test before deciding treatment.",
      "Testosterone treatment includes a gel rubbed on the shoulder, pills or an implantable pellet in the buttocks.",
      "Why do women use testosterone?",
      "Dr. Amy Voedisch, an OB-GYN at Stanford Medicine in Palo Alto, California, has noticed a dramatic rise in recent years in middle-age women asking for testosterone therapy.",
      "Perimenopausal symptoms begin when women reach their 40s, triggered by hormonal fluctuations and accompanied by irregular periods, brain fog, insomnia and hair loss. The changes typically begin a few years before menopause, when periods permanently end.",
      "Some women may notice a decrease in sex drive as levels of estrogen and testosterone, both of which play a role in libido, start to decline as they get older.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll talk about menopausal hormone therapy and then they\u2019ll say \u2014 but what about testosterone?\u201d",
      "Topical testosterone products first hit the market in the early 2000s.",
      "Voedisch, who has been in practice for decades, says the phenomenon among women really started to take off just in the last couple of years. Previously, interest in testosterone therapy rarely came up in appointments, she said.",
      "Now, virtually every new menopause patient she sees will ask about it.",
      "A patient will say, \u201cI was listening to this podcast, and they said that I needed this,\u201d she said. \u201cOr I have this Instagram person that I follow and she said that I absolutely have to be on it.\u201d",
      "On the Reddit community r/menopause, scores of posts tout the drug\u2019s benefits of improved energy and sex drive for women.",
      "Few of the claims are supported by evidence, Dunsmoor-Su said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll give them energy, it\u2019ll make them thin, it will make them horny, like they\u2019ve been promised,\u201d she said, describing common claims about the drug. \u201cIt does everything \u2014 and all of their problems are just because they\u2019re a little low in testosterone.\u201d",
      "Dr. Traci Kurtzer, a menopause specialist at the Northwestern Medicine Center for Sexual Medicine and Menopause in Chicago, agreed the push for testosterone started happening in recent years. Her patients inquire about testosterone therapy for multiple problems \u2014 to improve mood, energy, sex drive, brain fog and muscle mass.",
      "She tells patients that testosterone therapy is currently only recommended for a low sex drive, although future research may find other benefits.",
      "\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019ll be wonderful, but at this point in time we don\u2019t have the data to support that,\u201d Kurtzer said.",
      "Does testosterone help women?",
      "The Food and Drug Administration hasn\u2019t approved testosterone therapy for women. However, doctors can prescribe it for low sex drive after other causes, including medical and psychological ones, are ruled out, said Dr. Jan Shifren, director of Massachusetts General Hospital\u2019s Midlife Women\u2019s Health Center in Boston.",
      "Shifren, who has been involved in clinical trials looking at testosterone therapy in women, said that the benefits for women with low libido aren\u2019t terribly impressive.",
      "\u201cWomen who are randomized to testosterone, compared with placebo, have one additional satisfying sexual event in four weeks, compared with placebo,\u201d she said.",
      "In addition to declining hormonal levels, causes of low libido in women can include relationship problems, anxiety or depression, and metabolic conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes. Discomfort from vaginal dryness from menopause is another reason. Exhaustion from caregiving and other family responsibilities also take their toll, doctors say.",
      "Shifren urges women to address all other possible causes of low libido before starting testosterone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t sometimes prescribe it, but it\u2019s after addressing a lot of other concerns,\u201d she said.",
      "For Marcella Hill, 44, the symptoms of depression, body aches and low sex drive were affecting her relationship with her husband.",
      "\u201cI was really suffering,\u201d said Hill who lives in Vineyard, Utah. Her doctor told her that it was just normal.",
      "\u201cI thought that\u2019s insane. I can\u2019t live like this,\u201d Hill said.",
      "At first, she was given a testosterone gel prescription but didn\u2019t notice an improvement and found it hard to use.",
      "Frustrated that her doctor didn\u2019t offer more help, she went to a local medical clinic at a friend\u2019s urging and started testosterone pellet therapy, a more potent version of the hormone.",
      "After two years of treatment, she says the results have been life-changing.",
      "\u201cA couple months into it, all of a sudden my libido turns back on,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to be with my husband and I have this passion, this desire that I hadn\u2019t had since college.\u201d",
      "She posts about her testosterone therapy on Instagram and other social media.",
      "\u201c\u200b\u200bI opened TikTok to just tell that story, and the next day my phone blew up with 9 million views,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen all over the whole world were like, \u2018Wait, I have all these symptoms.\u2019\u201d",
      "Hill isn\u2019t paid for promoting testosterone, although she has worked with a telehealth company in ads urging women to get regular medical checkups.",
      "She gets her levels checked regularly and says that her testosterone is closer to the low end for a male. While she is not worried about her high levels, she does have an unwanted side effect \u2014 excess hair growth on her face.",
      "Is testosterone therapy safe?",
      "When prescribed by a doctor and carefully monitored, testosterone is relatively safe for women and side effects are rare, experts said.",
      "When men start testosterone therapy, it is typically given in a gel with a dose of 50-100 mg a day.",
      "Women, on the other hand, are recommended to take just 5 mg a day \u2014 10% of the dose of a man.",
      "Higher doses for women can cause side effects including acne, excessive body hair and even body odor. Some are permanent.",
      "Voedisch recalls one patient who finally stopped testosterone therapy after her voice was altered.",
      "\u201cShe said, \u2018What really did it for me was once I was on the phone and somebody called me \u2018sir,\u2019\u201d said Voedisch.",
      "Voedisch warned about side effects from improper dosing. \u201cIt may not get better even once you stop, which is really unfortunate.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s sympathetic to patients who feel ignored by doctors and are frustrated with the lack of treatment options available for perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms.",
      "\u201cWe have ignored women\u2019s health for a very long time in this country,\u201d said Voedisch. \u201cThis comes from a place of frustration and it comes from a place of wanting to feel better.\u201d"

      "Israeli strikes killed dozens of people on Sunday in Lebanon and the northern Gaza Strip, where the military has been waging\u00a0a major offensive\u00a0for more than a month that aid groups say has further worsened the humanitarian crisis in the besieged enclave.",
      "An Israeli airstrike killed at least 23 people in the village of Aalmat, north of Beirut and far from the areas in southern and eastern Lebanon where the militant Hezbollah group has a major presence. Lebanon\u2019s Health Ministry said a further six people were wounded. There was no immediate Israeli comment.",
      "In northern Gaza, an Israeli strike on a home sheltering displaced people in the urban refugee camp of Jabaliya killed at least 17 people, according to the director of a nearby hospital that received the bodies.",
      "Dr. Fadel Naim, director of the Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City, said the dead include nine women, and that the toll was likely to rise as rescue efforts continue.",
      "The Israeli military said it targeted a site where militants were operating in Jabaliya, without providing evidence. It said the details of the strike are under review.",
      "A separate strike on Sunday hit a house in Gaza City, killing Wael al-Khour, a minister in the Hamas-run government, as well as his wife and three children, according to the Civil Defense, a first responders organization that operates under the government.",
      "Israeli forces have encircled and largely isolated Jabaliya and the nearby towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun for the past month, allowing in\u00a0only a trickle of humanitarian aid. Hundreds of people have been killed since the offensive began on Oct. 6, and tens of thousands of people have fled to nearby Gaza City.",
      "On Friday, experts from a panel that monitors food security said\u00a0famine is imminent in the north\u00a0or may already be happening. The growing desperation comes as\u00a0the deadline approaches\u00a0for an ultimatum the Biden administration gave Israel to raise the level of humanitarian assistance allowed into Gaza or\u00a0risk possible restrictions on U.S. military funding.",
      "The northern third of Gaza, including Gaza City, was the first target of Israel\u2019s ground invasion and has suffered the heaviest destruction of the 13-month-old war, which was triggered by Hamas\u2019 attack into southern Israel. As in other areas of Gaza, Israel\u00a0has sent forces back in after repeated operations, saying Hamas has regrouped.",
      "The military says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians in homes and shelters. Israeli strikes often kill women and children.",
      "On Sunday, the Israeli military released what it said was video footage of Hamas abusing detainees. The soundless footage, dated from 2018 to 2020, appears to show detainees with hoods over their heads chained up in stress positions. In some of the clips, men beat or poke them with batons.",
      "It was not possible to independently verify the videos, which the military said it had recovered during operations in Gaza.",
      "Rights groups\u00a0have long accused\u00a0the Hamas-run government in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank of abusing detainees and violently quashing dissent.\u00a0Israel has been accused of similar abuses, especially since the start of the war. Israeli prison authorities say they follow relevant laws and investigate any allegations of wrongdoing.",
      "Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones and missiles into Israel after war broke out in Gaza in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed militant group Hamas.",
      "Israel retaliated, and a series of escalations over several months led to all-out war in September, when Israel carried out a wave of heavy strikes and\u00a0killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as most of his top commanders.",
      "Since then, Israel has struck areas deeper and deeper inside Lebanon, while Hezbollah has expanded its rocket fire from northern to central Israel. The fighting has killed over 3,000 people in Lebanon, according to the Health Ministry, and more than 70 people in Israel.",
      "In videos purporting to show the aftermath of Sunday\u2019s strike in Aalmat, some 25 miles north of Beirut, people were seen pulling the body of a little girl out of the rubble. The house had been flattened, and several cars nearby were also damaged.",
      "The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants blew holes in the border fence and stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. They killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted around 250.\u00a0Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Israel\u2019s offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities who do not distinguish between civilians and militants in their count but say over half the fatalities were women and children.",
      "Israeli bombardment and ground invasions\u00a0have left vast areas of Gaza in ruins\u00a0and displaced around 90% of the population of 2.3 million people,\u00a0often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands of people are living in crowded tent camps with few if any public services and no idea of\u00a0when they might return to their homes or rebuild.",

      "Yale University is getting in formation with a course dedicated to studying Beyonc\u00e9.",
      "Starting this upcoming spring semester, Yale will offer a class titled \u201cBeyonce Makes History: Black Radical Tradition History, Culture, Theory & Politics Through Music.\u201d The aim, according to its course description, is to use her work as a lens through which to examine Black intellectual thought and activism.",
      "It\u2019s the latest college course to take on pop culture-inspired themes by focusing on a global music superstar, as universities around the world have embraced classes on the cultural impact of celebrities including Beyonc\u00e9, Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.",
      "Following Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s innovations and influence from her self-titled 2013 album to her latest, \u201cCowboy Carter,\u201d students will analyze her albums, performance politics and concert films.",
      "By looking at her midcareer repertoire, Yale\u2019s new course will explore scholarly works and cultural texts across Black feminist theory, philosophy and anthropology, as well as art history, performance studies and musicology, the course description states.",
      "The class will be taught by writer and Black studies scholar Daphne Brooks, who co-founded Yale\u2019s Black Sound & the Archive Working Group, a community of faculty and students working to \u201cexplore the untapped variety of black sound archives.\u201d",
      "Brooks said via email that the course has been in the works for years. Having previously taught a course titled \u201cBlack Women and Popular Music Culture\u201d at Princeton University, Brooks said this will be her first opportunity to devote an entire lecture course to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s work.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to exploring her body of work and considering how, among other things, historical memory, Black feminist politics, Black liberation politics and philosophies course through the last decade of her performance repertoire,\u201d Brooks wrote, \u201cas well as the ways that her unprecedented experimentations with the album form, itself, have provided her with the platform to mobilize these themes.\u201d",
      "The course adds Yale to a string of universities that have created courses inspired by Beyonc\u00e9 over the past decade or so.",
      "Courses on the star\u2019s political and cultural influence have popped up since the early 2010s, with Rutgers University\u2019s \u201cPoliticizing Beyonc\u00e9\u201d class and a \u201cBeyonce: Critical Feminist Perspectives and U.S. Black Womanhood\u201d course at the University of Illinois at Chicago.",
      "Cornell University has also offered versions of its \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Nation\u201d course, which studies her career trajectory as well as her impact on political activism and feminism. Other universities that have offered similar Beyonc\u00e9-themed courses include the University of Texas at San Antonio, California Polytechnic State University and Arizona State University.",
      "And in the wake of Taylor Swift\u2019s album rerecordings and \u201cEras Tour,\u201d which shot her to even wider fame in recent years, multiple colleges \u2014 including Harvard University, UC Berkeley and the University of Florida \u2014 also began introducing courses tailored to the study of her lyricism and pop superstardom."

    "story": [
      "Qatar has halted its mediation efforts between Israel and Hamas, citing a lack of willingness from both sides to engage constructively, according to a diplomatic source briefed on the matter.",
      "Qatar\u2019s participation hinged on both parties demonstrating real interest in resolving the conflict, according to the diplomat. Qatari officials, however, concluded that recent negotiation efforts have been more focused on optics than peace efforts.",
      "The diplomat noted that Qatar may resume its role if both sides reach an impasse and show genuine intent to negotiate.",
      "Under U.S. pressure, Qatari officials had warned Hamas\u2019 political bureau earlier that it was no longer welcome in the country amid frustration over stalled hostage and cease-fire negotiations with Israel, according to a senior U.S. administration official and two diplomats briefed on the matter.",
      "\u201cHamas has been told that if this continues then Qatar cannot continue to host them,\u201d they said.",
      "\u201cQatar has become increasingly frustrated with a lack of progress toward a cease-fire by both Hamas and Israel,\u201d one of the diplomats told NBC News Saturday morning.",
      "Later, a diplomat added that Qatar had informed the Israelis and Hamas that \u201cas long as there is a refusal to negotiate a deal in good faith, they cannot continue to mediate. As a consequence, the Hamas political office no longer serves its purpose.\u201d",
      "The officials did not say whether Hamas had been given a deadline, how its diplomats had responded to the warning to leave, or where they would go.",
      "The move is one of multiple indications that the Biden administration is intensifying efforts to achieve a Gaza cease-fire and hostage deal before leaving office.",
      "The U.S. asked Qatar to kick out Hamas about two weeks ago when the group rejected another hostage proposal after Israel killed Hamas\u00a0leader Yahya Sinwar, the senior U.S. administration official told NBC News late Friday.",
      "Qatar agreed and told Hamas\u2019 political leaders about the decision about 10 days ago, the U.S. official said.",
      "\u201cHamas is a terrorist group that has killed Americans and continues to hold American hostages,\u201d the official said. \u201cAfter rejecting repeated proposals to release hostages, its leaders should no longer be welcome in the capitals of any American partner.\u201d",
      "According to one of the diplomats briefed on the matter, once the Qataris had made their decision, they notified Israel and Hamas as well as the U.S. administration.",
      "\u201cAll sides were given no advance warning and were informed after the decision was made,\u201d they said.",
      "A Hamas official contacted for comment did not respond. Israeli officials were not immediately available for comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Qatar\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Majed bin Mohammed Al Ansari, said on X that reports about the Hamas office in Doha were \"inaccurate,\" adding that the office's purpose is to be a \"channel of communication between the concerned parties.\" He characterized Qatar's efforts to mediate between the parties as \"currently stalled.\"",
      "Since the start of the war in Gaza, Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has played a key role in mediating talks between Hamas and Israel, alongside Egypt and the U.S.",
      "While housing Hamas representatives in Qatar has long been considered an advantage by negotiators, the country is under growing pressure from the U.S., with the outgoing Biden administration anxious to force Hamas and Israel into a deal before leaving office.",
      "Meanwhile, Qatari leaders face the prospect of a hawkish Trump presidency and more powerful Republican lawmakers with little tolerance for rounds of unsuccessful talks or patience with the kingdom\u2019s role as a go-between for militants.",
      "The U.S. request to oust Hamas came partly because of the death of American hostage Hersh Goldberg-Polin and it coincided with the unsealing of indictments for Hamas leaders, including Khaled Meshal, who is known to be living in Qatar, according to the U.S. official.",
      "The official said the U.S. is still trying to secure the release of hostages \u2014 and that the administration believes that expelling Hamas from Doha will place more pressure on the organization.",
      "\u201cQatar has played an invaluable role in helping to mediate a hostage deal and was instrumental in securing the release of nearly 200 hostages last year,\u201d the senior U.S. official said. \u201cHowever, following Hamas\u2019 repeated refusal to release even a small number of hostages, including most recently during meetings in Cairo, their continued presence in Doha is no longer viable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "About 250 people were taken hostage during Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which killed around 1,200. Of those, about 100 remain in captivity, with a third believed to be dead. More than 43,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza in the ensuing war, and Israeli forces have destroyed much of the blockaded enclave.",
      "The two diplomats told NBC News that Hamas was also asked to leave Qatar and relocate to Turkey in April. But after officials there failed to compel Hamas to agree to a hostage deal, that decision was quickly reversed, they said.",
      "\u201cThe Biden Administration and the Israeli government asked Qatar to bring them back to Qatar because they needed to continue the talks and couldn\u2019t do it while in Turkey,\u201d one diplomat said.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who is running to be Senate leader, co-sponsored a bill this year calling on the U.S. to reconsider Qatar\u2019s Major Non-NATO Ally Status.",
      "\u201cQatar has not been a good ally or partner to the United States for years,\u201d Scott said at the time.\u00a0\u201cIts recent behavior dealing with Hamas is telling.\u201d",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have also criticized Qatar for not forcing Hamas into an agreement.",
      "Earlier this year, Qatar defended its role in negotiations, with its embassy in Washington issuing a statement saying that Doha\u2019s capacity as mediator \u201cexists only because we were asked by the United States in 2012 to play this role.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlaming and threatening the mediator is not constructive, especially when the target is a friend and a Major Non-NATO Ally that presently hosts 10,000 U.S. troops and America\u2019s largest military presence in the Middle East,\u201d it added.",
      "Qatar has housed Hamas\u2019 political bureau for over 20 years, and before the war, provided the group with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual assistance, with the knowledge and cooperation of the Israeli government, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a New York-based think tank.",
      "Hamas\u2019 leadership is divided between a military wing, based in Gaza, and the political bureau, whose top officials have been based in Qatar. That included Ismail Haniyeh, who led Hamas\u2019 political bureau from 2017 to July 2024, when he was killed while on a diplomatic visit to Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, in an assassination believed to have been carried out by Israel.Where Hamas would relocate is not clear, but Iran might be one option.",
      "Hamas met with Iran\u2019s president in Doha last month. The \u201cZionist entity today in Gaza and Lebanon pierce the heart of every human being,\u201d President Masoud Pezeshkian said at the time. \u201cThis pain is even greater for those of us who consider the oppressed Palestinian people as our brothers in faith.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Northern Gaza is at risk of imminent famine, the World Health Organization said on Saturday, as Israel continues its bombardment across Gaza amid threats by the Biden administration to limit military assistance to Israel if it did not allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave.",
      "The Biden administration gave Israel a Nov. 12 deadline to take specific steps to improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza, but the continuity of U.S. policies towards Israel has become uncertain as President Joe Biden enters a lame duck period following Donald Trump\u2019s election on Tuesday.",
      "While Biden's policies and weapons provisions have consistently supported Israel, his relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has at times been strained, including by some efforts to restrain Israel or nudge the country toward compliance with international law.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has staunchly supported Israel's \u201cright to win its war on terror,\u201d and Netanyahu and other Israeli officials have greeted his election with enthusiasm. Netanyahu was among the first world leaders to congratulate Trump in a phone call, and in an effusive post on X, called Trump's victory \u201chistory\u2019s greatest comeback.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s election sparked celebrations in Israel, and has fueled concerns among observers of further escalation amid a deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.",
      "The WHO was citing a report by the Famine Review Committee that said that action was required \u201cwithin days, not weeks,\u201d to avert a catastrophic famine.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces did not immediately respond to the statement, but said Friday they were preparing to open the Kissufim crossing into southern Gaza as part of efforts to \"increase the volume and routes of aid into Gaza.\"",
      "The IDF said Saturday that 220 seriously injured and ill Palestinians and their caregivers were evacuated from Gaza last week.",
      "It also said that 713 aid trucks were brought into northern Gaza since the beginning of October.",
      "However, this amounts to an average of just 18 trucks per day, far short of what is required. On Saturday, the IDF reported that \"11 trucks\u00a0of food, water, and medical equipment\u201d were brought into the Jabaliya and Beit Hanoun areas in northern Gaza.",
      "Before the current conflict began in October 2023, more than 500 trucks per day crossed into Gaza, according to the International Rescue Committee.",
      "Israel's parliament also voted in October to ban the operations of UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees. UNRWA is the primary agency delivering\u00a0humanitarian aid in Gaza, that also provides essential services like shelter, health care, education and psychological support.",
      "Scott Paul, director of peace and security for Oxfam America, told NBC News that the upshot of UNRWA not being able to work \u201cis that in the Gaza Strip, where more than 2.2 million people are barely hanging on \u2014 and many of them are already dying \u2014 their support system goes away.\u201d",
      "Last week, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said the results of Israel's efforts to comply with U.S. demands on aid so far were \u201cnot good enough,\" and that its recommendations had \"not been met.\"",
      "But some believe a Trump administration may lead to a shift in U.S. policy toward Israel.",
      "The country\u2019s right-wing leadership was thrilled by Trump\u2019s victory, two officials in Israel told NBC News. However, they also said that excitement was tempered by concerns that the Biden administration would ramp up pressure in its final days.",
      "Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, feared Trump would give Netanyahu \u201ca green light\u201d to continue the war in Gaza.",
      "The famine warning came on the same day that the United Nations Human Rights Office said nearly 70% of the deaths it has verified in Gaza were women and children, and that 80% of them were killed in residential buildings.",
      "It said the highest number of deaths was among children ages 5 to 9 years old, closely followed by those ages 10 to 14, and then babies up to and including 4 years old.",
      "The report said it verified the details in a sample of 8,119 people killed in Gaza from November 2023 to April 2024. According to local health officials, at least 43,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, a number the U.N. considers reliable.",
      "The IDF told NBC News\u2019 British partner, Sky News, that it \u201cworks to minimize harm to non-combatants prior to attacks, especially women and children.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery military action is carried out in accordance with the principles of distinction and proportionality, and is preceded by a careful assessment of the potential for civilian harm. The IDF is committed to adhering to international legal obligations and operating under the laws of armed conflict,\u201d it said.",
      "The Israeli army has also distanced itself from comments made by Brig. Gen. Itzik Cohen, who\u00a0told Israeli reporters\u00a0last week that there was \"no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return.\"",
      "It said the statement was \"incorrect and does not reflect the IDF's objectives.\"",

      "A spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s civil defense\u00a0told NBC News\u00a0that Israeli attacks had killed 25 people on Saturday, with \u201cdozens\u201d still trapped under the rubble. It accused the IDF of preventing medical crews and rescue team from working in northern Gaza for the past 2 1/2 weeks.",
      "NBC News has reached out to the IDF for comment on the accusation.",
      "Secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, who visited Gaza last week, said the population in the north was being pushed \u201cbeyond breaking point.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe complete destruction I have witnessed this week in Gaza City and other urban areas of northern and central Gaza is worse than anything I could imagine,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A soldier for Yemen\u2019s exiled government opened fire on Saudi troops as they exercised in eastern Yemen, killing two of them and wounding another in a rare insider attack during the kingdom\u2019s nearly decadelong war there, officials said Saturday.",
      "The assault in eastern Hadramawt province comes as a yearslong cease-fire between Saudi Arabia and\u00a0Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels\u00a0largely has held despite the militants\u2019 ongoing attacks against shipping in the Red Sea corridor. While the Houthis did not claim the attack, at least one Houthi official praised it as being \u201cthe beginning and an indication of a harsh future awaiting the invaders.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. warplanes carried out new strikes targeting Houthi positions that lasted into early Sunday morning, the American military said. The strikes come after\u00a0the militants likely shot down yet-another American reconnaissance drone\u00a0over the country.",
      "The attack on the Saudi troops took place Friday night in Seiyun, a city some 310 miles east of Sanaa. As troops worked out at a Saudi-led base there, the soldier opened fire, killing an officer and a noncommissioned officer, the state-run Saudi Press Agency said, citing a military statement.",
      "\u201cThe Joint Forces Command underscores that this \u2018Lone Wolf\u2019 cowardly attack does not represent the honorable members of the Yemeni Ministry of Defense,\u201d the statement added. The dead and the other wounded Saudi solider have been brought back to the kingdom, it added.",
      "Aidarous al-Zubaidi, the leader of Yemen\u2019s successionist Southern Transitional Council, identified the soldier who carried out the attack as belonging to the First Military Region, which is based out of Seiyun.",
      "Police in the area published pictures of the soldier, saying there was a 30-million-Yemeni-rial reward for information leading to the soldier\u2019s arrest. That\u2019s worth around $15,000 on the black market.",
      "Authorities offered no motive for the attack. Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, the militant group\u2019s Yemen branch, long has operated around Hadramawt. However, the group did not immediately claim the attack. A recent United Nations expert report has said that the al-Qaida group and the Houthis have begun to \u201ccoordinate operations directly with each other.\u201d",
      "The Houthis meanwhile did not claim the attack either. However, Houthi official Hamid Rizq praised the attack in a message on the social platform X, claiming it came from \u201cthe feeling of oppression\u201d over Saudi troops being stationed in the area.",

A Saudi-led coalition entered the war on behalf of Yemen\u2019s exiled government in 2015. The war further internationalized, with Iran backing the Houthis with weapons and support that cemented the conflict into a yearslong stalemate.",
      "The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.\u00a0A cease-fire that expired in October 2022 largely has held in the time since, however, even as the Houthis have seized on\u00a0the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in the Gaza Strip and Israel\u2019s invasion of Lebanon.",
      "On Saturday night, Houthi-run media reported U.S. airstrikes targeting areas around Sanaa. The airstrikes continued into Sunday morning and also included sites in Amran province just outside of the capital, the Houthis said. The rebels offered no immediate damage assessment from the strikes.",
      "The U.S. military later told The Associated Press on Sunday it conducted airstrikes \u201con numerous Iran-backed Houthi weapons storage facilities within Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.\u201d It described the sites as housing advanced conventional weapons used to target military and civilian ships in the Red Sea corridor, but offered no other immediate details.",
      "The U.S. military has targeted radar stations,\u00a0military bases\u00a0and drone and missile launch sites since beginning its ongoing airstrike campaign against the Houthis in January.",

      "Tensions between the rival Koreas have escalated as North Korean leader\u00a0Kim Jong Un flaunts his advancing nuclear and missile program\u00a0and engages in electronic and psychological warfare, such as flying thousands of balloons to\u00a0drop trash and anti-South Korean propaganda leaflets\u00a0in the South.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korean operations to manipulate GPS signals were detected from around the western border city of Kaesong and the nearby city of Haeju on Friday and Saturday, and said the activities disrupted dozens of civilian aircraft and several vessels.",

      "\u201cWe urge North Korea to stop GPS interference provocations immediately and strongly warn that it will be held fully accountable for any resulting consequences,\u201d the South\u2019s joint chiefs said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "The Summary",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in Scotland known for lingering year-round has melted for the fourth consecutive year.",
      "It's just the 10th time in more than three centuries that it has vanished.",
      "Such snow patches can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change.",
      "A patch of snow in the Scottish Highlands dubbed the Sphinx typically lingers year-round, staying frozen through the summer. But it has melted away for the fourth consecutive year \u2014 only the 10th time in more than three centuries that has happened.",
      "The Sphinx, which adorns the side of Braeriach, the third-highest mountain in Great Britain, was historically considered the United Kingdom\u2019s longest-lasting snow patch because it was known for sticking around even after most snow and ice vanished every year in Scotland\u2019s Cairngorms mountain range.",
      "In September, however, the patch melted entirely, as it has every year since 2021. In the 20th century, by comparison, the Sphinx vanished just three times.",
      "Such snow patches tend to be sensitive to small fluctuations in temperatures, experts say, so they can act as harbingers of the broader consequences of climate change. The melting of the Sphinx, then, offers clues about how climate change is affecting the Scottish Highlands \u2014 and by extension the rest of the country and the world.",
      "\u201cThe Sphinx melting for four years in a row now is a good indicator of these changes,\u201d said Grant Moir, CEO of the\u00a0Cairngorms National Park\u00a0Authority. \u201cClimate change was always relatively high up on the agenda for us as a national park, and we\u2019re seeing impacts on the Highlands more and more. You get an idea from the Sphinx of the changes that are happening to our climate.\u201d",
      "In addition to snowmelt, Moir said, the Highlands are experiencing more frequent storms and floods, interspersed with longer periods of dry weather that increase the risk of wildfires.",
      "Shifts in snow cover across the Highlands have consequences for the mountain ecosystems, since they alter the natural hydrological cycle in which snow gradually melts from mountains and flows into streams.",
      "\u201cThere are big impacts on things like salmon spawning grounds and on the river overall,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to mitigate some of these impacts, and we\u2019ve got to see what we can do differently to adapt to these changing patterns.\u201d",
      "The Cairngorms park is also home to some of the U.K.\u2019s endangered species, he added.",
      "The ripple effects extend beyond the natural environment. Around 18,000 people live in the national park, and roughly 2 million visit every year, Moir said. But severe storms and floods can displace residents, cause millions of pounds in damage and disrupt valuable tourism in the region, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been about trying to get that the right balance, to make sure that nature and people can thrive in the national park,\u201d Moir said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure we invest in things that are good for nature, good for biodiversity and good for people, as well.\u201d",
      "Iain Cameron, author of \u201cThe Vanishing Ice: Diaries of a Scottish Snow Hunter,\u201d has spent more than 25 years studying snow across Scotland\u2019s hills and mountains. Every year, he publishes his findings on the region\u2019s snow cover in the Royal Meteorological Society\u2019s annual report.",
      "Last year, Cameron wrote that the fate of the Sphinx was a tale with \u201clittle prospect of a happy ending.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere can be little doubt that we are witnessing a shift in language used to describe patches of snow in Scotland,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn days gone by the adjective that best described The Sphinx was \u2018permanent\u2019, but that had to change to \u2018semi-permanent\u2019, then to \u2018perennial\u2019 and then \u2018semi-perennial\u2019. But even this descriptor will not be able to withstand the pressure put on it by continual disappearance. We are now looking at an epoch where patches of snow are possibly going to be only occasional survivors.\u201d"

      "The hope is that a map of sunken vehicles could lead to the recovery of bodies. Nearly 100 people have been officially declared missing, and authorities admit that is likely more people are unaccounted for, in addition to more than 200 declared dead.",
      "Pablo Carrera, the marine biologist leading the mission, estimates that in 10 days his team will be able to hand over useful information to police and emergency services. Without a map, he said, it would be practically impossible for police to carry out an effective and systematic recovery operation to reach vehicles that ended up on the seabed.",
      "\u201cIt would be like finding a needle in a haystack,\u201d Carrera told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "Many\u00a0cars became death traps\u00a0when the tsunami-like flooding hit on Oct. 29.",
      "The boat will join a wider effort by police and soldiers who have expanded their searches for bodies and the missing beyond the devastated towns and streets. Searchers have used poles to probe into layers of mud while sniffer dogs tried to find scent traces of bodies buried in canal banks and fields. They are also looking at beaches that line the coast.",
      "The first area the Ram\u00f3n Margalef is searching is the stretch of sea off the Albufera wetlands, where at least some of the water ended up after\u00a0ripping through villages\u00a0and the southern outskirts of Valencia city.",
      "Carrera, 60, is head of the fleet of the research vessels run by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, a government-funded science center under the umbrella of the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "He boarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef in Alicante, located on Spain\u2019s south coast, from where it will set sail to reach Valencia\u2019s waters before dawn Saturday. The plan is to go straight to work with the 10 scientists and technicians and 14 sailors working non-stop in shifts. The boat also helped research the impact from the lava flow that reached the sea from the\u00a02021 La Palma volcano\u00a0eruption in Spain\u2019s Canary Islands.",
      "Finding a body at sea, Carrera said, is highly unlikely. So the focus is on large objects that shouldn\u2019t be there.",
      "The boat\u2019s submersible robot loaded with cameras can dive to a depth of 60 meters to attempt to identify cars. Ideally, they will try to locate license plates, although visibility could be extremely limited and the cars could be smashed to bits or engulfed in the muck, Carrera said.",
      "In the longer term, he said his team will also evaluate the impact of the flood runoff on the marine ecosystem.",
      "Those findings will contribute to initiatives by other Spanish research centers to study Spain\u2019s\u00a0deadliest floods of the century.",
      "Spain is used to the occasional deadly flood produced by autumn storms. But the drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures\u00a0helped magnify these floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain\u2019s meteorological agency said that the 30.4 inches of rain that fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis is an all-time national record.",

      "TV footage showed the steel structure of the platform\u2019s roof blown apart and a destroyed tea stall. Luggage was strewn everywhere. Most of the victims were taken to a state-owned hospital and some to a military one.",
      "Wasim Baig, a spokesman for the health department and police said over a dozen soldiers and six railway employees were among the dead at the station, where a walk-through gate has been installed to check whether anyone is carrying explosives. Still, there are multiple other entrances to the station without such security.",
      "A separatist group, the Balochistan Liberation Army, claimed the attack in a statement, saying a suicide bomber targeted troops present at the railway station. The outlawed BLA has long waged an insurgency seeking independence from Islamabad.",
      "A senior superintendent of police operations, Muhammad Baloch, said separatists frequently attacked soft targets.",
      "\u201cWhen their people are arrested, they also attack in retaliation. We all have to fight this war. We are resilient. Our teams are here and trying to save as many lives as we can.\u201d",
      "Police said some of the critically wounded passengers had died in the hospital, raising the death toll.",
      "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif denounced the bombing in a statement, saying those who orchestrated the attack \u201cwill pay a very heavy price for it,\u201d adding that security forces were determined to eliminate \u201cthe menace of terrorism.\u201d",
      "Afghanistan\u2019s Foreign Ministry also condemned the bombing and expressed its condolences to the families of the victims, as did the Russian Embassy in Islamabad.",
      "Saturday\u2019s assault came a little over a week after\u00a0a powerful bomb attached to a motorcycle\u00a0exploded near a vehicle carrying police officers assigned to protect polio workers in the province, killing nine people, including five children who were nearby.",
      "In August, the BLA carried out multiple coordinated attacks on passengers buses, police and security forces across Balochistan, killing more than 50 people, mostly civilians.",
      "Oil- and mineral-rich Balochistan is Pakistan\u2019s largest but also least populated province. It is a hub for the country\u2019s ethnic\u00a0Baloch minority whose members say they face discrimination\u00a0and exploitation by the central government. Along with separatist groups, Islamic militants also operate in the province.",
      "The BLA mostly targets security forces and foreigners, especially Chinese nationals who are in Pakistan as part of Beijing\u2019s multibillion-dollar\u00a0Belt and Road Initiative, which is working on major infrastructure projects. The group often demands the halt of all Chinese-funded projects and for workers to leave Pakistan to avoid further attacks.",
      "Last month, the BLA claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that targeted a convoy with Chinese nationals outside Karachi airport, killing two. Beijing has asked Pakistan to ensure the safety of its citizens working in Balochistan and other parts of the country."

    "story": [
      "Roving gangs on scooters attacked and beat Israeli\u00a0soccer fans in Amsterdam, the Dutch capital, overnight in an outburst of what authorities called antisemitic violence.",
      "Footage circulating on social media showed supporters of the Maccabi Tel Aviv soccer team being chased down and assaulted on Thursday night, with one video geolocated by NBC News to near Amsterdam's central station that showed fighting on the streets between the Israelis and their attackers.",
      "\"Boys on scooters crossed the city in search of Maccabi Tel Aviv supporters,\" Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said. \"It was a hit-and-run. Football fans were beaten and scared, after which the rioters quickly left again, fleeing the police force that was on the move en masse yesterday.\u201d",
      "A separate video geolocated by NBC News showed Israeli fans taunting pro-Palestinian protesters either before or after Thursday's match by singing \u201cDeath to the Arabs\u201d and \u201cLet the IDF win. We will f*** the Arabs,\u201d as well as tearing down a Palestinian flag.",
      "The war in Gaza triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack that killed 1,200 people has caused outrage throughout Europe, including in the Netherlands.",
      "Amsterdam, like many major cities across the world, has been convulsed by large protests condemning the ongoing Israeli invasion of Gaza, the deaths of more than 43,000 Palestinians and the destruction of much of the enclave.",
      "The violence unfolded in a city that was once home to a young Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers during World War II.",
      "\u201cYesterday there was an outburst of antisemitism such as we had hoped to see no more in Amsterdam,\" Halsema said.\u00a0\"I express the strongest condemnation of the violence that has taken place. Among our Jewish Amsterdam residents there is fear, dismay, anger, disbelief.\u201d",
      "The fighting erupted after the match between the Israeli team and the Dutch club Ajax. There have been outbreaks of soccer hooliganism and fighting between fans of competing clubs around the world for many years,\u00a0but it\u2019s unclear how much of that contributed to the violence in this case.",
      "\"Rioters\" had \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them,\" Halsema's office said in a statement.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Halsema said the city has taken emergency measures to prevent any more violence, including a three-day ban on all demonstrations.",
      "Police said that five people required hospital care, while 20 to 30 others suffered nonserious injuries, and at least 62 people were arrested.",
      "Eyewitness describes attack",
      "Iddo Gold, 23, told NBC News in a video call Friday that he and other Maccabi fans had taken the train into Amsterdam\u2019s city center after the game. They were ambushed when they got there, he said.",
      "\u201cEverybody ran through the streets,\u201d Gold said. \u201cWhatever they saw in the street, they tried to attack us with.\u201d",
      "Gold said they were chased by attackers on motorbikes and some of their pursuers were armed with knives. He said that they fled to their hotels and that he let a fellow fan stay with him because he was too afraid to venture back outside.",
      "When dawn broke, Gold said they were still too \"frightened to go into the streets.\"",
      "In a video shared by the Israeli Embassy is Washington, which NBC News has not been able to independently verify, a man could be seen being beaten as an attacker shouts: \u201cThis is for the children! Free Palestine now!\u201d",
      "Tevel Caro, 18, said he and a friend had already made it back to their hotel when they began to receive messages from other Maccabi fans about what was going on outside.",
      "On Friday, Caro said he was sheltering in a safe house with dozens of other Israelis, worried about how they would get back home.",
      "Caro, who said he will soon be doing his mandatory Israeli military service, said he was disappointed that Israel was not deploying military aircraft in addition to the El Al airliners.",
      "\"I felt so lonely,\" Caro said. \"You know, like I'm supposed to get deployed in two weeks and no one cares about me.\"",
      "The Ajax team has historically drawn fans from Amsterdam\u2019s large Jewish community. The confrontation between the Israelis and pro-Palestinians appeared to be more about Gaza than soccer.",
      "Even before the game, tensions between Israeli fans and local Palestinian supporters were simmering, Amsterdam's acting police chief, Peter Holla, said Friday at a news conference.",
      "As a precaution, hundreds of extra police officers were dispatched to Amsterdam, Hollas said.",
      "Some of the Israeli fans added to the tensions, Holla said, by attacking a taxi Wednesday as well as a Palestinian flag.",
      "There was also a confrontation before the game between Israeli fans and pro-Palestinian demonstrators, and police struggled to keep the two groups apart, Holla said.",
      "World leaders decry violence",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said he was \u201chorrified by the antisemitic attacks on Israeli citizens.\u201d",
      "He described the violence as \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and said he had spoken to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone \u201cto stress that the perpetrators will be identified and prosecuted.\u201d",
      "Other European leaders echoed those sentiments, with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock calling the images emerging from Amsterdam \u201chorrific & deeply shameful for us in Europe,\u201d in a post on X.",
      "Netanyahu was briefed in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\u2019 situation room on Friday.",
      "In comments shared by his office, he said that Israel \u201ccannot accept this\u201d and that the violence \u201cputs us and them, the free countries and the Netherlands, in danger.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu compared the incident to Kristallnacht, or the \u201cNight of Broken Glass,\u201d when almost exactly 86 years ago, on Nov. 9, 1938, Nazi mobs in Germany launched pogroms and vandalized Jewish-owned homes, synagogues and businesses.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog spoked directly with King Willem-Alexander about the \"antisemitic pogrom\" in Amsterdam, the Dutch royal family said. The king expressed his shock and said \"history has taught us how intimidation goes from bad to worse, with horrific consequences.\"",
      "\"Jewish people must feel safe in the Netherlands,\" the king said.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Deborah Lipstadt, the special envoy to monitor and combat antisemitism, condemned the incident and also said it was \"terribly reminiscent of a classic pogrom.\"",
      "Lipstadt said she was also \"deeply disturbed by how long the reported attacks lasted and called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation into security force intervention and on how these despicable attacks transpired.\"",
      "European soccer's governing body, UEFA, condemned the violence Friday, saying that it trusted authorities to \"identify and charge as many of those responsible for such actions as possible.\"",
      "UEFA said in a statement that it planned to \"examine all official reports, gather available evidence, assess them and evaluate any further appropriate course of action in accordance with its relevant regulatory framework.\"",
      "The widening war in the Middle East has sparked protests across the world, including at sporting events. A giant \u201cFree Palestine\u201d banner was unveiled at a Paris Saint Germain game on Wednesday, drawing criticism from France\u2019s interior minister. Israel\u2019s national team is scheduled to play France in Paris on Nov. 14."
