      "Songwriter and producer Bert Berns has been posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame",
      "NEW YORK -- Songwriter and producer Bert Berns, who had a hand in some of the biggest hits of the 1960s, including co-writing \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d for the Isley Brothers and the plaintive \u201cPiece of My Heart\u201d sung by Janis Joplin, has been inducted posthumously into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.",
      "Berns, who died in 1967 at age 38, was welcomed into the Hall on Tuesday at a ceremony at the 54 Below cabaret club in New York City. It included video tributes by Paul McCartney and Van Morrison and rock royalty like Steve Miller and Steven Van Zandt. It was hosted by Paul Shaffer and Berns\u2019 son, Brett, and daughter, Cassandra.",
      "Berns joined the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.",
      "Berns signed a then-21-year-old Morrison for Bang Records and produced one of rock\u2019s catchiest and most enduring songs, \u201cBrown Eyed Girl.\u201d",
      "Berns co-wrote and produced Solomon Burke's \u201cEverybody Needs Somebody to Love\u201d and \u201cCry to Me,\u201d co-wrote The McCoys' hit \u201cHang On Sloopy\u201d and produced \u201cUnder the Boardwalk\u201d by The Drifters, which landed on Rolling Stone magazine\u2019s list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. His version of \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2010.",
      "He started Bang Records in 1965 in partnership with the three owners of Atlantic \u2014 the label name was an acronym drawn from their first names (Berns, Ahmet Ertegun, Nesuhi Ertegun and Gerald Wexler).

      "Real moviegoer energy has always made the Toronto International Film Festival a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season but what will click with audiences",
      "TORONTO -- Anyone will tell you it\u2019s the audiences that make the Toronto International Film Festival. They aren\u2019t purely industry folks, like they are in Cannes or Venice, but more boisterous, enthusiastic moviegoers with their own rituals, like growling like buccaneers at the piracy warning that plays before each screening.",
      "That real-moviegoer energy has always made TIFF a good measuring stick for not just what might catch on during Hollywood\u2019s awards season, but also what will click with audiences. Yet there might be no more endangered species in today\u2019s film industry than the kind of crowd-pleaser that thrives in Toronto.",
      "More than most years, this year\u2019s festival, which wraps up this weekend, has been a veritable ark for the castaways of today\u2019s Hollywood: star-driven dramas, big-screen comedies, adult-oriented movies without a whiff of franchise about them. All struggled to reach the screen in the first place. But for many of these movies, the fight to reach audiences is just getting started.",
      "One of the standouts was Derek Cianfrance\u2019s \u201cRoofman,\u201d a stranger-than-fiction true tale about a North Carolina man (Channing Tatum) imprisoned for robbing dozens of McDonald's by burrowing in from their roofs. He escapes prison and, instead of trying to outrun the authorities, hides out for weeks inside a Toys \u201cR\u201d Us. Cianfrance, the grittily realistic filmmaker of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d and \u201cThe Place Beyond the Pines,\u201d uses the story as a funny and oddly moving examination of box-store materialism. Paramount will release it Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cWhen I was shopping it around, a lot of people were saying, \u2018We don\u2019t make movies like this anymore,\u2019\u201d Cianfrance said. \u201cSo it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s one of the reasons why there are so many production credits on the front of the movie. I had to get it from everywhere to be able to do it.\u201d",
      "The movie industry is coming off a summer that fell painfully shy of expectations. May-to-Labor Day ticket sales at the North American box office came to about $3.67 billion, according to Comscore, well short of the $4 billion-plus season that was once automatic. You could point to numerous reasons for that, like the diminished potency of superhero films or that Sony Pictures Animation\u2019s \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d the biggest hit of the summer, launched on Netflix, not in theaters.",
      "But it\u2019s also true that Hollywood, mostly concerned with hitting home runs, is badly in need of some doubles, too.",
      "This year\u2019s TIFF was full of good candidates, though some of them will be steered toward streaming platforms. That includes Rian Johnson\u2019s deliciously gothic, surprisingly sincere, church-set whodunit \u201cWake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery,\u201d which Netflix will give a two-week theatrical release despite its director\u2019s strong affinity for theaters.",
      "And Paul Greengrass\u2019 \u201cThe Lost Bus,\u201d a disaster movie for the age of climate change, will likewise get a quick two weeks in theaters before landing on Apple TV+. Starring Matthew McConaughey as a bus driver rescuing kids during the 2018 Camp Fire, Greengrass' film viscerally captures the swift-spreading blaze, as well as the dry, tinderbox landscape it rose out of.",
      "But even a brief theatrical run can be hard-won. Nia DaCosta\u2019s \u201cHedda,\u201d a stylish 1950s-set Ibsen adaptation starring Tessa Thompson, will launch in theaters Oct. 22 before detouring to Prime Video a week later.",
      "\u201cLiterally three months after it was greenlit, people were like: This movie wouldn\u2019t happen anymore,\u201d DaCosta said. \u201cWe were with Orion Pictures, a full theatrical release, and then the strikes happened. We were holding. We had to fight for the movie to stay alive. We lived but the consequence of that was theatrical window and then Prime Video. We did feel that industry shift. But I\u2019m really proud we got to make it.\u201d",

It was a reminder that success in Toronto no longer guarantees anything.",
      "Some are taking distribution into their own hands.

      "A new Whitney Houston song has arrived 13 years after her death",
      "NEW YORK -- It sounds impossible, but that's the magic of it. On Thursday, a new Whitney Houston song arrives 13 years after her death.",
      "English singer Calum Scott is responsible. The single is a duet between Scott and Houston, a balladic reinterpretation of the timeless \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me),\u201d using Houston's original vocal stems. (Stems are the individual musical elements that, when combined, make up a song.)",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t even something I could have dreamt as a possibility, and the fact that I'm getting to do it is, geez, one of the honors of my career,\u201d Scott told The Associated Press. Houston's voice is one that soundtracked his childhood \u2014 courtesy his mom \u2014 and he refers to Houston as one of the most influential performers in his life and the lives of many.",
      "\u201cTimeless,\u201d he describes her.",
      "Here's how the new song came into existence.",
      "Such an undertaking couldn't be possible without the approval of a number of parties. Specifically, it required Pat Houston, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the executor of her estate, and Primary Wave, which acquired the copyrights to hit Whitney Houston songs as part of a 2022 deal.",
      "Pat Houston says the idea for Scott's \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d actually came from Primary Wave. They were familiar with Scott's live cover version of the song from his stint opening for Ed Sheeran in 2024. On that tour, Scott stripped the 1987 classic down into a ballad, blending it with Robyn's \u201cDancing On My Own.\u201d",
      "After hearing what Scott could do with the song \u2014 taking it from its up-tempo pop spirit to a big-hearted ballad, while also taking into consideration that 2025 marks the 40th anniversary of Houston's music career \u2014 Pat Houston was on board. It was yet another opportunity for celebration. \u201cI said, you know what, this is a no-brainer. This is the Houston style. So, let\u2019s go with this,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhitney was a balladeer and that\u2019s why we all fell in love with her,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd Calum turned the song into a beautiful ballad.\u201d",
      "First, the Houston estate and Primary Wave provided Scott with the original vocal stems, produced by her longtime producer Narada Michael Walden. Then Scott recorded the song with producers Jon \u201cMAGS\u201d Maguire, Andrew Yeates and Charlie T in the U.K. in \u201cabout a week,\u201d he recalls. They were joined by a string section, which gave additional dimension to their somber take on the song.",
      "\u201cTake a pop song and make it sad,\u201d Scott jokes of his approach.",
      "Recording the ballad made sense because, as Scott points out, the lyrics to the original song are a bit melancholic. \u201cYou want to dance with somebody who loved you, you know, you're not actually dancing with them,\u201d he says. It's about yearning. But in an early demo, the chorus was recorded in a minor chord \u2014 which sounded a bit too depressing. The change was made swiftly; even slowed, the song needed some of that Houston ebullience.",

      "Eagle-eyed (eared?) fans might notice the sound of a snare drum bleeding into her vocal on that verse \u2014 because it was originally recorded to tape, not digitally, and because \u201cwe can\u2019t change anything like that because those are etched into the song and into her vocal,\u201d says Scott. \u201cAnd to remove it would be taking a piece away.\u201d",
      "It's one of the reasons they kept the song's iconic key change in the last chorus as well.",
      "\u201cI really had to dig for those high notes,\u201d he says of the recording. \u201cIt was an honor just to harmonize with her.\u201d",
      "Scott looked to the original songwriters for approval \u2014 the dream team of George Merrill and Shannon Rubicam. They were immediately on board.",
      "\u201cSome people would have come in and they would have added something ... to boost their visibility next to Whitney. And he had the boldness to tear it all down and just have acoustic piano, just Whitney, and then give her the first verse,\u201d said Merrill. \u201cAnd I mean, this is his project. To me, that\u2019s showing such respect.\u201d",
      "That, and they recognize Scott as a virtuosic vocalist. \u201cHis music really features his voice, as with Adele or Whitney, and rightly so because he can carry it off,\u201d said Rubicam. \u201cThere aren\u2019t just hundreds of people who can carry that off with his kind of power.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re a good vocal match together,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey both got a lot of emotionality and command also of their vocal instrument. ... Whitney could overpower a lot of people. But for Calum, he\u2019s confident and he had a vision about it and they both are meeting at an emotional level.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I gently walked alongside Whitney,\u201d says Scott. The song is meant to feel alive, channeling the spirit of Houston \u2014 not a tribute, but an active single. It's why their version of \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)\u201d will be featured on his new album \u201cAvenoir,\u201d out Oct. 10.",
      "\u201cThis is as much part of my story as any other song on the album,\u201d he says. \u201cJust being given the honor of it has been, you know, I could die a very happy man now.\u201d",
      "\u201cForty years ago, this particular song was hot then and it\u2019s hot now,\u201d says Pat Houston. \u201cSo why not keep producing. But it\u2019s the right connection, it's the right platform and it certainly is the right artist to collab with her on this.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\"Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale\" brings change to the Crawley family as they face the 1930s",
      "Change comes slowly to the Downton Abbey universe and its Crawley family. Just watch Robert Crawley go flat-hunting in London.",
      "Wait, what? FLAT-HUNTING? The Earl of Grantham? Well, yes, and it\u2019s the most amusing scene in \u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale\u201d (a self-announcing title if there ever was one).",
      "Just look at proud and starched Robert (Hugh Bonneville), trying to be open-minded but utterly flummoxed by this \u201cflat\u201d in which you cannot go \u201cup\u201d to bed because there is no \u201cup.\u201d Well, you can go \u201calong\u201d to bed, suggests daughter Mary (Michelle Dockery, as always the sensible center of things) trying to make it all sound manageable.",
      "But the prospect of flat-living \u2014 rather than maintaining a mansion in London \u2014 is a thing the Crawleys must consider as they move into the 1930s, with financial and social instability always around the corner. \u201cFamilies like us need to keep moving to survive,\u201d says Mary, with the weight of Downton Abbey\u2019s future itself resting on her shoulders.",
      "A note to those coming in cold to the franchise here: Well, it\u2019s going to be quite hard. Writer Julian Fellowes and director Simon Curtis do not engage in hand-holding when it comes to mastering the Crawley family tree or the broader family of servants that Downton fans know and love. Even those who saw the first two films \u2013 the last in 2022 \u2013 might feel the need for a refresher.",
      "We begin in London\u2019s West End, at a show by Noel Coward, attended by Downton inhabitants from all levels. They\u2019re all there to watch dashing actor Guy Dexter (Dominic West), who in the last movie asked former butler Thomas Barrow to become his dresser, and more. It\u2019s nice to see Barrow is happy now, able to live life as a gay man \u2014 even if Robert can\u2019t quite grasp their relationship (change is slow, remember).",
      "Meanwhile Mary is shopping in London with sister Edith, and the importance of this scene is perhaps to remind us that the real star of the \u201cDownton\u201d universe, after that stupendous house of course, are the costumes. Mary finds a sleek red satin gown that is quite possibly the most smashing outfit we\u2019ve seen yet.",
      "But when she puts it on for a society ball, trouble erupts. As the family arrives we learn that Mary\u2019s divorce decree has come through \u2014 and this means, alas, that she will become a pariah. The newspaper screams news of \u201cdivorce in high places,\u201d and indeed, the ball\u2019s hostess actually kicks Mary out of the party because royalty is coming. Mary\u2019s concerned parents are outraged \u2014 but they stay, and their daughter heads out, quipping that she hopes a taxi will agree to take her.",
      "Soon enough we\u2019re back at Downton, and there is one very big difference: no longer does Violet Crawley, aka Maggie Smith, with her inimitable style and those hilarious quips, rule the halls. She died in the last film \u2014 and Smith died in 2024. But the film is dedicated to her in more ways than one.",

      "Harold arrives from America with some unfortunate news \u2013 he\u2019s wasted away much of their family fortune. Accompanying him is friend Gus, a handsome and clever type \u2014 or so it seems \u2014 who has been advising Harold on his finances. Gus (Alessandro Nivola) worms his way into Mary\u2019s good graces, and more \u2014 but he may not be nearly as clever as he first appears.",
      "Then there\u2019s Simon Russell Beale as the pompous Hector, who tries to hold onto local tradition but runs up against Isobel (Penelope Wilton), and a charming Arty Froushan as Noel Coward himself. The playwright is the closest thing in Downton world to a modern celebrity \u2014 everyone wants to be with him, no matter station nor gender, and he winds up helping Mary overcome her social shunning.",
      "Nowhere to be seen is dashing Hugh Dancy, who played a film director (besotted with Mary) in the last movie. But the character that director anointed as a screenwriter, Joseph Moseley (Kevin Doyle), is back, and Fellowes must have enjoyed writing this line for him: \u201cIn many ways the writers are the stars of cinema.\u201d",
      "To be honest, the script veers from clever to extremely sappy, or to filler lines like \u201cI think I\u2019ll go get another cup.\u201d But kudos for moment a befuddled Robert describes the newfound phenomenon of an apartment building as \u201ca layer cake of strangers.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes I feel that the past is a more comfortable place than the future,\u201d someone says in a poignant moment. But this final movie will give loyal Downton fans what they want: a satisfying bit of closure and the sense that the future, though a bit scary, may look kindly on Downton Abbey as long as Mary is in charge. And as long as Smith\u2019s Violet, imposing in a front-hall portrait, is looking down from above.",
      "\u201cDownton Abbey: The Grand Finale,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG by the Motion Picture Association \u201c for suggestive material, smoking and some thematic elements.\u201c Running time: 123 minutes. Two and half stars out of four.",

      "David Bowie's archive opens to the public this week, revealing a treasure trove of unrealized projects and personal items",
      "LONDON -- When David Bowie died in 2016, he left a vast musical legacy \u2013 and a trove of unrealized projects.",
      "Tantalizing details of those abandoned and unfinished ideas are revealed in Bowie\u2019s archive, which opens to the public this week.",
      "The 90,000 items acquired from Bowie\u2019s estate by London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum include handwritten notes for a movie in which Major Tom, the fictional astronaut \u201cfloating in a tin can far above the world\u201d in Bowie\u2019s song \u201cSpace Oddity,\u201d is sent to \u201ca disgruntled America.\u201d",
      "Curator Madeleine Haddon said the never-made film \u2014 titled \u201cYoung Americans,\u201d like Bowie\u2019s 1975 album of the same name \u2014 is \u201creflective on what it\u2019s like to be a Brit in the U.S., and thinking about international politics and their place in the world.\u201d",
      "Other might-have-beens include \u201cThe Spectator,\u201d a stage musical about an 18th-century London outlaw that Bowie was working on shortly before his death from cancer in January 2016 at the age of 69.",
      "It\u2019s about \u201cthe relationship between art and politics in London at the cusp of modernity,\u201d Haddon said Wednesday at a preview of V&A's David Bowie Centre. \u201cI would love to see where he was going with that.\u201d",
      "The center, which opens Saturday, is a treasure chest for Bowie fans and researchers, holding everything from stage outfits and musical instruments \u2013 a stringed Japanese koto, Ziggy Stardust\u2019s acoustic guitar \u2013 to letters, lyrics, photos, to-do lists and idea-filled sticky notes.",
      "The archive chronicles decades of restless creativity by the shape-shifting musician, who was born plain old David Jones in the London suburbs in 1947.",
      "Bowie donned and shed personas as he moved through musical styles, from glam rock to soul, electronica and collaborations with British jungle and drum \u2018n\u2019 bass musicians, including A Guy Called Gerald and Goldie. He also acted in movies and on Broadway, collaborated on stage shows, painted and embraced technology, setting up a 1990s internet service provider called BowieNet.",
      "\u201cHe was such a world-builder,\u201d Haddon said. \u201cMusic was (just) one angle into the worlds he wanted to build.\u201d",
      "The archive occupies part of the V&A East Storehouse, a hybrid warehouse-museum that opened in June in east London\u2019s Olympic Park. As with the storehouse as a whole, visitors can book appointments to see any of the items for free \u2013 and in many cases handle them, under supervision.",
      "\u201cWe want visitors to be inspired by Bowie, to pursue their own creativity, discover new stories and make unexpected connections between Bowie, contemporary discussions and themselves,\u201d Haddon said.",

      "\u201cThe Alexander McQueen costumes and some of the Ziggy costumes are proving particularly popular,\u201d said V&A archivist Sabrina Offord.",

      "Some of the items are iconic, others delightfully mundane. There's the key to the Berlin apartment Bowie shared with Iggy Pop in the 1970s, and his Rarotonga driver\u2019s license from a period filming the 1983 movie \u201cMerry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence\u201d on the South Pacific island.",

      "\u201cIt's an ensemble of musicians who come somehow from making chamber music,\u201d Dohn\u00e1nyi said in a 2011 interview for the Cleveland Orchestra Musicians. \u201cThe real, very special (characteristic) about the Cleveland Orchestra is that people, musicians, are used to listen to each other very much. All orchestra should do it, many do it, but very few do it to the extent the Cleveland Orchestra is able to do it.\u201d",
      "Showing remarkable stability, the orchestra has been led since his departure by Franz Welser-M\u00f6st, who plans to leave in 2027.",
      "Dohn\u00e1nyi was born in Berlin on Sept. 8, 1929, a son of lawyer Hans von Dohnanyi and Christine Bonhoeffer, sister of the pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer and grandson of the Hungarian composer Ernst von Dohn\u00e1nyi.",

      "From a record-breaking standing ovation to the ever-present Campari spritzes to even on-screen subtitles, the 2025 Venice Film Festival was a bounty of interesting numbers",
      "VENICE, Italy -- After 10 days and dozens of red carpet premieres, the 82nd edition of the Venice Film Festival came to a close Saturday. While cinema is focused on the qualitative, a quantitative look can tell a story of its own. There are, after all, plenty of fascinating figures \u2014 beyond the celebrity kind \u2014 to be found on the Lido.",
      "Here's a look at this year's Venice Film Festival, by the numbers.",
      "That figure includes 1,936 feature films, which cost 200 euros ($234) apiece to submit. To be eligible for selection, a film must have been completed after Sept. 7, 2024, and must be making its world premiere at Venice. The festival decides what section a selected film goes in.",
      "It amounts to slightly over 1% of the feature films submitted. The 21 movies were the ones eligible for awards like the Golden Lion, which was won this year by Jim Jarmusch's \u201cFather Mother Sister Bother.\u201d There were also 30 films making their world premieres at Venice, but out of competition, like Luca Guadagnino's \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d Nineteen films played in the Horizons (Orizzonti) sidebar, which has its own awards. The Venice Classics sidebar featured 18 restorations.",
      "Led by American director Alexander Payne, the jury included French director St\u00e9phane Briz\u00e9, Italian director Maura Delpero, Romanian director Cristian Mungiu, Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof (he lives in exile in Germany), Brazilian actor Fernanda Torres and Chinese actor Zhao Tao. They decide the winners among the main competition.",
      "The applause meter at film festivals is notoriously faulty, calibrated differently outlet by outlet, but it was clear that the ovation for \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d was record-breaking and definitely over 20 minutes. Variety reported 22 and BBC had it at 23. Kaouther Ben Hania's movie easily surpassed last year's Golden Lion winner, Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s \u201cThe Room Next Door,\u201d which had people on their feet for 18 minutes.",
      "Doing the math, that's definitely more than 82 years ago. The festival has been suspended or periodically taken different forms over the years, including during World War II \u2014 though it did go forward in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Selections hailed from far and wide, from the U.S., France and, of course, Italy, to Ecuador, Slovakia and Taipei.",
      "There's space for short films \u2014 20 minutes and under \u2014 and feature films \u2014 longer than 60 minutes \u2014 but woe betide the filmmaker who makes anything in between.",
      "That distinction belongs to Olivier Assayas\u2019 \u201cThe Wizard of the Kremlin,\u201d an adaptation of Giuliano da Empoli\u2019s bestselling book of the same name, in which Jude Law transforms into Vladimir Putin.",
      "The longest ovation went to the shortest film in competition, \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab.\u201d Ben Hania's film combines real audio from Hind Rajab, the Palestinian 6-year-old girl who was found dead days after her desperate call for rescue in Gaza, with actors portraying volunteers at the Red Crescent, where the movie is set.",
      "Israel's war in Gaza reverberated through the festival, with high-profile calls to disinvite Gerard Butler and Gal Gadot over the war and questions to filmmakers and actors about an indie film company\u2019s funding ties to the Israeli military. The Aug. 30 march in Venice aimed to turn the spotlight from the stars to the war, and organizers estimate that over 10,000 people turned out.",
      "Those Golden Lions went to Kim Novak, the 92-year-old legendary actor who starred in Alfred Hitchcock's \u201cVertigo,\u201d and Werner Herzog, the prolific 83-year-old German filmmaker whose works range from lauded documentaries like \u201cLittle Dieter Needs to Fly\u201d to the Nicolas Cage-starrer \u201cBad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.\u201d (He also acts, as viewers of \u201cThe Mandalorian\u201d can attest.)",

      "That\u2019s the recipe Italian spirits maker Campari advises when it comes to the simple, refreshing cocktail that\u2019s a staple of the Venice Film Festival. Usually selling for 4 euros, the spritzes are ubiquitous around the festival's HQ.",
      "The Venice Film Festival doesn't take place in the heart of the city, which would be the Piazza San Marco. Instead, it's on the Lido, a barrier island across the Venetian Lagoon. The Palazzo del Cinema, featuring three movie theaters, is the main headquarters of the festival. It takes 32 minutes to make the journey, by vaporetto, the public water bus. (For good measure, pun somewhat intended, 4.5 kilometers is just under 3 miles.)",
      "Over the decades, few tableaux are as glamorous as movies stars arriving, stylishly disheveled, by launch to the festival. Ferried to and from the Lido, celebrities, journalists and members of the public with passes cross the Venetian Lagoon. Should they fall overboard, they would contend with a depth of up to 71 feet (21 meters).",
      "The historic theater is home to the biggest screenings at the festival, as well as the awards ceremonies. It includes four additional spaces for people in wheelchairs.",
      "Every film shown at Venice has to have subtitles burned in: Non-Italian-language movies must have Italian subtitles, and Italian-language movies must have English subtitles. (All films are shown with English subtitles projected off-screen.) The festival's detailed subtitling guidelines suggest opting for white on-screen subtitles. And, yes, the festival has a preferred font. Much like the Microsoft Office of yore, it's Arial.",

      "A new study finds well-preserved areas of Amazon rainforest occupied and managed by Indigenous peoples show lower incidences of multiple diseases in the regions around them",
      "Every time humans cut into the Amazon rainforest or burn or destroy parts of it, they're making people sick.",
      "It's an idea Indigenous people have lived by for thousands of years. Now a new study in the journal Communications Earth & Environment adds to the scientific evidence supporting it, by finding that instances of several diseases were lowered in areas where forest was set aside for Indigenous peoples who maintained it well.",
      "With the United Nations climate summit set for Brazil in November, the study authors and outside experts said the work highlights the stakes for people around the world as negotiators try to address climate change. Belem, the city hosting the conference, is known as the gateway to the Amazon, and many who will be attending, from activists to delegates, think the role of Indigenous communities in climate action and conservation will be highlighted in a distinct way.",
      "\u201cThe \u2018forest man\u2019 or \u2018man forest,\u2019 according to the Indigenous perspective, has always been linked to the reciprocity between human health and the natural environment where one lives,\u201d said Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez Cayetano, president of the Federation of Ticuna and Yagua Communities of the Lower Amazon, or FECOTYBA, in the Peruvian Amazon. \u201cIf each state does not guarantee the rights and territories of Indigenous peoples, we would inevitably be harming their health, their lives, and the ecosystem itself.\u201d",
      "That harm can look like respiratory diseases such as asthma caused by toxic air pollution after fires, or illnesses that spread from animals to humans such as malaria, said Paula Prist, a senior program coordinator for the Forest and Grasslands Unit at the International Union for Conservation of Nature and one of the study authors.",
      "The researchers compiled and analyzed data on forest quality, legal recognition of Indigenous territory and disease incidence in the countries that border and include the Amazon.",
      "The work was \u201cimpressive\u201d to University of Washington health and climate scientist Kristie Ebi. She said it highlighted the complexity of factors that affect human health, and the importance of understanding the role Indigenous communities play in shaping it. \u201cUsing these methods, others could study other parts of the world,\u201d she said.",
      "The researchers found creative ways to account for other variables that can affect the spread of diseases, like access to health care in a given area, said Magdalena Hurtado, an anthropology and global health professor at Arizona State University and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences who was not involved with the study. But she expressed concern that the findings were presented with a precision that may not be warranted, given that they were based on correlation and use data on observations that can be difficult to measure.",
      "\u201cThey claim that Indigenous territories only protect health when forest cover is above 40%. And so that that feels like, why 40%? Why not 35? Or why not a range?\u201d she asked. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that the study is wrong, but it means that we need to be cautious because the patterns could change if different, more precise methods were used.\u201d",
      "Still, she thinks this is a starting point that could open the door to future research. \u201cThey are actually doing something quite beautiful,\u201d empirically connecting the legal recognition of Indigenous lands to human health outcomes, she said.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, of FECOTYBA, said that's important for the global policymakers who are coming to Brazil.",

      "Prist said the goal of the study was to understand how landscapes can be healthy for people, but that it would be naive to suggest that all forest landscapes stay exactly as they are, especially with the land needs of farming and livestock production.",

The judge later continued, \u201cIt is abundantly clear that the true purpose of issuing the subpoena is to interfere with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' right to protect GAC within its borders, to harass and intimidate BCH to stop providing such care, and to dissuade patients from seeking such care.\u201d",
      "Just eight days after taking office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aimed at restricting access to medical care for transgender youth. In June, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division announced the division would use \u201call available resources to prioritize investigations of doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and other appropriate entities,\u201d in an effort to investigate what it called \u201cradical gender experimentation.\u201d",

Bondi said the requests were part of investigations into \u201chealthcare fraud, false statements, and more.\u201d But the requests did not just seek information on policies or billing practices \u2014 they also demanded information about individual patients who had been prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "Boston Children's Hospital asked the federal court to quash the subpoena on July 8, saying the Justice Department was seeking practically every document related to the provision of gender-affirming care over the past five and a half years, including highly sensitive and personally identifiable information about young patients.",

      "A gas tanker truck has exploded and burned multiple vehicles under a Mexico City highway overpass, killing four people and injuring 90 others",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican investigators were working to determine the cause of a crash in which a tanker truck carrying more than 13,000 gallons (49,500 liters) of gas exploded on a major highway in the capital, killing at least four people and injuring 90.",
      "The fiery crash Wednesday that burned more than two-dozen vehicles created a gruesome scene of badly burned survivors staggering in the street in tattered clothing as first responders rushed to the scene. The injured suffered second- and third-degree burns.",
      "The tragedy drew renewed attention to the thousands of trucks that rumble through Mexico daily carrying liquid propane, which most homes and businesses rely on for cooking and heating water. Regulators said a preliminary review revealed the truck did not have up-to-date insurance allowing it to transport gas.",
      "While Wednesday\u2019s accident involved a large tanker, rather than the smaller ones that make residential deliveries, both have been involved in deadly crashes over the past decade.",
      "In 2020, a double tanker carrying liquid propane flipped on a highway in the western state of Nayarit and killed 13 people when the fire spread to other vehicles.",
      "In 2015, a leak on a smaller propane truck making a delivery at a Mexico City maternity hospital allowed gas to leak into the building and blow most of it up, killing five and injuring dozens.",
      "\u201cThis is a horrible accident,\u201d Mexico City Mayor Clara Brugada said at the site of the explosion Wednesday night.",
      "Lists of the injured showed that some suffered burns over 100% of their bodies. Among those injured were a baby and a 2-year-old child.",
      "As emergency vehicles sped by and medics attended to the injured, groups of neighbors ran helped pull burn victims from the fire and get them to safety.",

      "For over three years, Ukraine has been battling Russian attack drones",
      "LONDON -- For more than three years, Ukraine has waged an almost nightly battle against Russian attack drones. NATO on Wednesday got a taste of that fight.",
      "Polish authorities said they detected 19 violations of their airspace, prompting a million-dollar response as fighter jets were scrambled and Patriot air defense systems placed on alert. Up to four drones were shot down with the help of NATO allies.",
      "The incursion, which lasted for several hours, showed NATO's vulnerability to drone warfare. Russian authorities said they didn\u2019t target Poland, and Belarus, a close ally, said some of the drones \u201clost their course\u201d because they were jammed. Nonetheless, several European leaders and experts said Poland was deliberately targeted.",
      "If one or two drones crossed into Polish airspace, it could have been a \u201ctechnical malfunction,\u201d but it \u201cdefies imagination that it could have been accidental\u201d when there were 19, said Poland's Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski.",
      "While proving intent is difficult, \"to have several to lose their way is starting to look rather deliberate,\u201d agreed Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "A goal, he suggested, could have been to test NATO's reaction and ability to respond to drones.",
      "Since January, Russia has fired at least 35,698 attack drones at Ukraine according to an Associated Press analysis of data from the Ukrainian air force.",
      "Polish airspace has been violated multiple times since the beginning of Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Fragments from Ukrainian missiles killed two people in Poland in 2023, while drones have strayed into Poland, Romana and Moldova as well as the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.",
      "But until Wednesday, no NATO country had sustained multiple incursions into its airspace. It was the first time NATO airpower was engaged against enemy targets inside a NATO country.",
      "Drone fragments were found about 554 kilometers (344 miles) into Polish territory \u2014 deeper than any previous incursion.",
      "Much remains unclear, and for now, NATO is cautious. \u201cWe do not yet know if this was an intentional act or an unintentional act,\u201d U.S. Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, NATO\u2019s supreme allied commander Europe, said Thursday.",
      "He went on: \u201cI would not be able to tell you with any confidence today that it was 20 (drones) or that it was 10. We just have to get into the technical details to figure that out, to debrief the crews that were up, see what they saw, et cetera.\u201d",
      "It's difficult \"without hard evidence,\u201d to say if Moscow really intended to fly the drones into Poland, said Ash Alexander-Cooper, a former specialist military commander and vice president at Dedrone, which produces technology to detect and neutralize drone threats.",
      "But, based on what is known about Russian drones and how they respond to electronic warfare, the experts who spoke to AP said it was highly possible the incursions were deliberate.",
      "There are two key ways to neutralize most drones: either shoot them down, or hit them with electronic signals interference.",
      "Jamming and spoofing are the main ways to do that. Jamming severs the connection the drone has with a satellite navigation system, whereas spoofing tricks the drone into thinking it is somewhere else.",
      "If the drone were jammed \u2014 either by Ukraine or Poland \u2014 it would either land or fly back toward its point of origin in Russia or Belarus, said Withington.",
      "If it were spoofed, it could fly off course, crash or land.",
      "If the drone were spoofed, trying to jam it could actually \u201cmake the problem worse,\u201d said Alexander-Cooper. Jamming a drone normally sends it home, but Russia is now programming some drones so that their \u201chome\u201d is actually their target. If satellite communications are cut, the drones continue toward their targets.",
      "Military drones also have inertial navigation units, which use previous position fixes and gyroscopes to mark the drone\u2019s position relative to the earth so that it can keep flying without satellite or radio signals.",
      "In that case, the drones could only have penetrated deep into Polish airspace if Russia had given them a targeted \u201cmission,\" said Withington.",

      "The response, Alexander-Cooper suggested, was economically disproportionate to the threat.",

      "After Wednesday's incursion, Polish authorities said drone fragments were found at 16 locations. This could indicate that several drones escaped.",
      "The fact that some of the drones were able to fly so far into Polish airspace is an indication that \u201cperhaps somewhere the detection capability was lacking,\u201d said Withington.",
      "Current NATO air defenses are largely set up to detect and neutralize fast-moving targets like cruise and ballistic missiles, said Withington. They are not, he said, designed to track small objects, often made from fiberglass or plastic, which don\u2019t reflect radar waves in the same way as a metal missile.",
      "Sikorski said Wednesday Poland needed a drone wall and \u201cnew techniques\u201d to repel a mass attack.",

      "Lee said the Korean workers are set to be brought home on Friday aboard a charter plane following negotiations with the U.S.",
      "The massive roundup in Georgia, and U.S. authorities\u2019 release of video showing some workers being chained and taken away, sparked widespread anger and a sense of betrayal in South Korea. The raid came less than two weeks after a summit between President Donald Trump and Lee, and just weeks after the countries reached a July agreement that spared South Korea from the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs, but only after Seoul pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investments.",

      "During the news conference, Lee said South Korean and U.S. officials are discussing a possible improvement to the U.S. visa system, adding that under the current system South Korean companies \u201ccan\u2019t help hesitating a lot\u201d about making direct investments in the U.S.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Wind and solar power generated more than a third of Brazil\u2019s electricity in August, the first month on record the two renewable sources have crossed that threshold, according to government data made public on Thursday and analyzed by energy think tank Ember.",
      "The clean energy sources accounted for 34% of the country\u2019s electricity generation last month, producing a monthly record of 19 terawatt-hours (TWh), enough to power about 119 million average Brazilian homes for a month, Ember told The Associated Press.",
      "That surpassed the previous high of 18.6 TWh set in September 2024. The milestone came as hydroelectric output, Brazil\u2019s dominant power source, fell to a four-year low.",
      "\u201cBrazil shows how a rapidly growing economy can meet its rising need for electricity with solar and wind,\u201d said Raul Miranda, Ember\u2019s global program director based in Rio de Janeiro.",
      "\u201cSolar and wind are a perfect match for Brazil\u2019s hydropower resources, taking the pressure off in drought years. A diversified mix is a fundamental strategy for tackling risks related to climate change,\" he said.",
      "Hydropower provided 48% of electricity in August, only the second month on record it has supplied less than half of Brazil\u2019s power. Despite the weak hydro output, fossil fuel plants, mainly powered by natural gas, coal and oil, accounted for just 14% of generation, or 7.8 TWh. In past drought years, fossil fuel use has spiked to cover shortfalls, reaching 26% in August 2021.",
      "Ember said the rapid growth of wind and solar helped Brazil avoid similar surges this year.",
      "Wind and solar power are also reshaping the country\u2019s energy mix. In 2024, they generated 24% of Brazil\u2019s electricity, more than double their share from five years earlier. Solar power grew from just over 1% of generation in 2019 to 9.6% in 2024, while wind climbed from 8.8% to 15% over the same period.",
      "Brazil\u2019s power sector emissions peaked in 2014 and by 2024 had fallen 31% even as electricity demand rose 22%, Ember said. The think tank credited a fifteenfold increase in wind and solar generation with outpacing demand growth and cutting fossil generation by 45%.",
      "Ricardo Baitelo, project coordinator at Brazil\u2019s Institute for Energy and the Environment, said the record reflects more than a decade of steady growth in wind and solar capacity, with solar expanding rapidly in recent years.",
      "\u201cThis is a number that was expected, because the installed capacity of these sources has been built over at least 15 years and, more recently, with solar energy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is undoubtedly symbolic, and you see these sources contributing a significant fraction of electricity at a given moment and showing that they are important. They are not alternative sources, they are already a well-represented part of Brazil\u2019s electricity mix.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s president says that South Korean companies will likely hesitate to maintain or make direct investments in the United States if the U.S. fails to improve its visa system for Korean workers",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday that South Korean companies will likely hesitate to maintain or make direct investments in the United States if the U.S. fails to improve its visa system for Korean workers.",
      "In a news conference marking 100 days in office, Lee called for improvements in the U.S. visa system as he spoke about the Sept. 4 immigration raid in Georgia that resulted in the arrest of more than 300 South Korean workers at a battery factory under construction at Hyundai\u2019s sprawling auto plant in Georgia.",
      "Lee said the Korean workers are set to be brought home on Friday aboard a charter plane following negotiations with the U.S.",
      "The massive roundup in Georgia, and U.S. authorities\u2019 release of video showing some workers being chained and taken away, sparked widespread anger and a sense of betrayal in South Korea. The raid came less than two weeks after a summit between President Donald Trump and Lee, and just weeks after the countries reached a July agreement that spared South Korea from the Trump administration\u2019s highest tariffs, but only after Seoul pledged $350 billion in new U.S. investments.",
      "Lawmakers from both Lee\u2019s liberal Democratic Party and the conservative opposition decried the detentions as outrageous and heavy-handed, while South Korea\u2019s biggest newspaper compared the raid to a \u201crabbit hunt\u201d executed by U.S. immigration authorities in a zeal to meet an alleged White House goal of 3,000 arrests a day.",
      "During the news conference, Lee said South Korean and U.S. officials are discussing a possible improvement to the U.S. visa system, adding that under the current system South Korean companies \u201ccan\u2019t help hesitating a lot\u201d about making direct investments in the U.S.",
      "U.S. authorities said some of the detained workers had illegally crossed the U.S. border, while others entered legally but had expired visas or entered on visa waivers that prohibited them from working.",
      "But South Korean experts and officials said Washington has yet to act on Seoul\u2019s yearslong demand to ensure a visa system to accommodate skilled Korean workers, though it has been pressing South Korea to expand industrial investments in the U.S.",
      "South Korean companies have been relying on short-term visitor visas or Electronic System for Travel Authorization to send workers who are needed to launch manufacturing sites and handle other setup tasks, a practice that had been largely tolerated for years.",
      "Lee said that whether the U.S. establishes a visa system allowing South Korean companies to send skilled workers to industrial sites will have a \u201cmajor impact\u201d on future South Korean investments in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not like these are long-term workers. When you build a facility or install equipment at a plant, you need technicians, but the United States doesn\u2019t have that workforce and yet they won\u2019t issue visas to let our people stay and do the work,\u201d he said.",

      "\u201cIf that\u2019s not possible, then establishing a local facility in the United States will either come with severe disadvantages or become very difficult for our companies. They will wonder whether they should even do it,\" Lee added.",
      "Lee said the raid showed a \u201ccultural difference\u201d between the two countries in how they handle immigration issues.",
      "\u201cIn South Korea, we see Americans coming on tourist visas to teach English at private cram schools \u2014 they do it all the time, and we don\u2019t think much of it, it\u2019s just something you accept,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cBut the United States clearly doesn\u2019t see things that way. On top of that, U.S. immigration authorities pledge to strictly forbid illegal immigration and employment and carry out deportations in various aggressive ways, and our people happened to be caught in one of those cases,\u201d he added.",
      "Following a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Wednesday that U.S. officials have agreed to allow the workers detained in Georgia to later return to finish their work at the site. He added that the countries agreed to set up a joint working group for discussions on creating a new visa category to make it easier for South Korean companies to send their staff to work in the United States.",
      "Before leaving for the U.S. on Monday, Cho told lawmakers that more South Korean workers in the U.S. could be vulnerable to future crackdowns if the visa issue isn\u2019t resolved, but said Seoul does not yet have an estimate of how many might be at risk.",
      "The Georgia battery plant is one of more than 20 major industrial sites that South Korean companies are currently building in the United States. They include other battery factories in Georgia and several other states, a semiconductor plant in Texas, and a shipbuilding project in Philadelphia, a sector Trump has frequently highlighted in relation to South Korea.",
      "Min Jeonghun, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, said it\u2019s chiefly up to the United States to resolve the issue, either through legislation or by taking administrative steps to expand short-term work visas for training purposes.",
      "He said it would be a mistake to underestimate the public anger in South Korea over the detentions in Georgia, which came after Lee\u2019s government pledged to pour hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industrial investments against the backdrop of a decaying job market at home.",
      "Without an update in U.S. visa policies, Min said, \u201cKorean companies will no longer be able to send their workers to the United States, causing inevitable delays in the expansion of facilities and other production activities, and the harm will boomerang back to the U.S. economy.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- In another grim sign for the U.S. labor market, jobless claim applications jumped to their highest level in almost four years last week, virtually assuring the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate next week.",
      "The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits for the week ending Sept. 6 rose by 27,000 to 263,000, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That\u2019s the most applications since the week of Oct. 23, 2021 and well above the 231,000 new applications economists forecast. It's also the biggest week-to-week increase in almost a year.",
      "Most analysts were already forecasting an interest rate cut after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled as much at a conference of central bankers three weeks ago. However, another report Thursday showing that consumer inflation remains elevated could complicate the Fed's dual mandate of keeping prices in check while supporting a healthy labor market.",
      "Typically the Fed would cut its key rate when unemployment rose in an attempt to spur more spending and growth. But it would do the opposite and raise rates \u2014 or keep them unchanged \u2014 in the face of rising inflation.",

      "Fed officials recently have expressed greater concern about the deteriorating labor market than inflation, and while a rate cut could spur economic growth and boost the job market, economists fear it could push inflation even farther above the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.",
      "Earlier this week, the Bureau of Labor Statistics issued a massive preliminary revision of U.S. job gains for the 12 months ending in March, further evidence that the labor market has not been as strong as previously thought.",
      "The BLS\u2019s revised figures showed that U.S. employers added 911,000 fewer jobs than originally reported in the year ending in March 2025, with the biggest weakness coming from the leisure and hospitality sector, professional and business services and retail. The report showed that job gains were tapering long before President Donald Trump rolled out his far-reaching tariffs on U.S. trading partners in April.",
      "The department issues the revisions every year, intending to better account for new businesses and ones that had gone out of business. Final revisions will come out in February 2026.",
      "The updated figures came after the agency reported Friday that the economy generated just 22,000 jobs in August, well below the 80,000 economists were expecting.",
      "Also last week, the government said that U.S. employers advertised 7.2 million job openings at the end of July, fewer than economists had forecast and the first time since April of 2021 that there were more unemployed Americans than job postings.",

      "It was the second island-wide outage this year, with three other blackouts reported late last year.",

      "Havana, the country\u2019s capital of some two million people, appeared calm, although many ventured out to try and find certain items before dark.",

      "WASHINGTON -- U.S. inflation likely ticked higher last month as the Trump administration's import taxes have lifted the price of goods, potentially putting the Federal Reserve in a tough spot when it meets next week.",
      "Economists forecast that consumer prices rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, according to a survey of economists by data provider FactSet. That would be an increase from an annual pace of 2.7% in July. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, core inflation is expected to have increased 3.1%, the same as in July. Both figures are above the Fed\u2019s 2% inflation target.",
      "The potential increases, while modest, would underscore the challenges the Fed is facing as it experiences relentless pressure from President Donald Trump to reduce its short-term interest rate. Trump hopes that rate cuts will spur more borrowing and spending and boost the economy.",
      "Recent government reports have also shown that hiring has slowed sharply in recent months and was lower than previously estimated last year, a sign that companies may be worried about future sales and are less interested in adding staff. The unemployment rate ticked up in August to a still-low 4.3%.",
      "Typically the Fed would cut its key rate when unemployment rose to spur more spending and growth. Yet it would do the opposite and raise rates \u2014 or at least keep them unchanged \u2014 in the face of rising inflation. Last month, Chair Jerome Powell signaled that Fed officials are increasingly more concerned about jobs, and are likely to cut their rate when they meet next week. Yet stubbornly high inflation could keep the Fed from cutting very quickly.",
      "On a monthly basis, prices are expected to have risen at an accelerated pace, increasing 0.3% from July to August. Core prices are expected to also increase 0.3% on a monthly basis. The cost of groceries and gas are forecast to have risen last month.",

If so, that would make it easier for the Fed to keep cutting its key rate. Wall Street investors expect the Fed to implement three cuts this year, according to futures pricing tracked by CME Fedwatch.",
      "The inflation data arrives at the same time that Trump has sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook as part of an effort to assert more control over the Fed. Yet late Tuesday, a court said the firing was illegal and ruled that Cook could keep her job while the dispute played out in the courts.",

      "British horse racing has gone ahead with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting",
      "LONDON -- British horse racing went ahead Wednesday with its unprecedented one-day strike to protest a feared rise in taxes on race betting, with a top official in the sport urging the industry to \u201cstand together\u201d and \u201cmake their voices heard.\u201d",
      "Four scheduled meetings \u2014 at Carlisle, Uttoxeter, Lingfield and Kempton \u2014 have been canceled and rescheduled after agreements between the owners of the courses and the British Horseracing Authority, making it the first time the sport in Britain has voluntarily refused to race in modern history.",
      "The BHA set up the \u201cAxe the Racing Tax\u201d campaign in response to proposals to replace the existing three-tax structure of online gambling duties with a single tax, with fears the current 15% duty on racing could be increased to the 21% levied on games of chance.",
      "Economic analysis commissioned by the BHA says such a rise could cost the sport at least 66 million pounds ($90 million) and put around 2,750 jobs at risk in the first year, in what BHA chairman Charles Allen described as \u201cnothing short of an existential threat for our sport.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need every part of our industry \u2014 trainers, jockeys, stable staff, racecourses, and fans \u2014 to stand together and make their voices heard,\" Allen said.",
      "\u201cWe are Britain\u2019s second largest spectator sport, supporting 85,000 jobs and delivering over 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) of economic value every year. Yet all of this is now being put at risk by a change that would devastate our funding model and the livelihoods that depend on it.\"",
      "Allen said the protests are about \u201cprotecting communities across Britain\u201d and \u201csafeguarding a national institution.\u201d",
      "Previously, the British government said it was bringing the \u201ctreatment of online betting in line with other forms of online gambling to cut down bureaucracy.\u201d",

      "Rangers All-Star pitcher Jacob deGrom is excited to be going back to where his career began",
      "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Jacob deGrom is excited to be going back to where his career began, the home stadium where he made 109 of his 245 starts in the big leagues and had back-to-back Cy Young Award-winning seasons with the New York Mets.",
      "\u201cIt holds a special place in my heart,\u201d deGrom said. \u201cI pitched a lot there, and Mets fans were always good to me. So taking the mound in front of that crowd was always a fun experience.\u201d",
      "Now the lanky right-hander will find out if that holds true when pitching against them.",
      "DeGrom is set to face the Mets on Friday night for the first time since leaving in free agency after the 2022 season and signing with the Texas Rangers. The teams contending for playoff spots in their respective leagues open a three-game series at Citi Field.",
      "\u201cWith what he did for the Mets, how much time he spent there, I'm sure he's probably going to have some memories and emotions even before he pitches,\u201d Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. \u201cHe'll be well-received, no doubt. But it's going to be a big game, so there may be some scattered boos in there.\u201d",
      "The 37-year-old deGrom (11-7, 2.78 ERA) was the only All-Star player from the Rangers this season. His 27 starts and 155 2/3 innings are the most since his last Cy Young Award in 2019, before the pandemic-shortened 2020 season and then a series of injury-plagued years with New York and Texas.",
      "\u201cThe main thing coming into this year was try to take the ball as many times as I can. I didn\u2019t know how many times that would be. ... The goal is to just keep it going,\" deGrom said this week.",
      "\u201cHe looks great, he does. I\u2019m really pleasantly surprised at how well this has gone for him this year because, you know, you don\u2019t know,\u201d Bochy said. \u201cThis is a lot of work for him after that surgery and not pitching for a couple of years, almost three. ... Yeah, it\u2019s gone very well.\u201d",
      "Earlier this season, deGrom set a Rangers franchise record with 14 consecutive starts going at least five innings and not giving up more than two runs. That same span was the longest streak by any traditional starter (not including openers) in the modern era since 1900 of not allowing more than six hits and two runs in a game, according to STATS. He also came the closest he ever has to a no-hitter when allowing only a leadoff single in the eighth inning June 25 at Baltimore, a month after the only start in his career without a strikeout.",
      "When Texas played the Mets each of the past two seasons, deGrom both times was recovering from the Tommy John surgery he had after only six starts in his Rangers debut. They went to New York late in the 2023 season before winning their first World Series championship that fall, and hosted a three-game series in Arlington last year.",
      "In his last start at Citi Field, deGrom had 13 strikeouts in five innings without a decision in the Mets' win over Pittsburgh on Sept. 18, 2022. His major league debut was also there, when he went seven innings and allowed the lone run in a 1-0 Subway Series loss to the Yankees on May 15, 2014.",

He was shut down during spring training in 2022 after a stress reaction in his right scapula, then was 5-4 with a 3.08 ERA in 11 starts over the final two months of that season before becoming a free agent.",
      "The $185 million, five-year contract deGrom signed with Texas included a conditional sixth-year club option for 2028 that was triggered because of the time missed after Tommy John surgery. That option is worth at least $20 million, and could be up to $37 million depending on his total innings pitched and if finishing top five in Cy Young voting.",

      "An early-season surge in abuse directed at Black players in competitions across Europe has alarmed anti-discrimination campaigners and highlighted how racism persists in soccer despite multiple initiatives by soccer bodies FIFA and UEFA, national federations and individual clubs to eliminate it.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more than double what we had last season at the same time,\u201d said Piara Powar, executive director of the Fare network, an anti-discrimination group which works with the global and European soccer bodies to monitor and advise on incidents at games.",
      "\u201cIf you layer social-media issues on top of that,\u201d Powar added in a phone interview, referencing the abuse of England player Jess Carter at the Women\u2019s European Championship this summer, \u201cthen you really are getting into a lot of stories coming out.\u201d",
      "Frustrated at the lack of progress, some Black players have called for tougher penalties against offenders from both the justice system and soccer institutions.",
      "\u201cIn this day and age, we\u2019re still, us players, getting racially abused and it just doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Semenyo told British broadcaster ITV. \u201cWe just want to know why it keeps happening.\u201d",
      "The man arrested on suspicion of hurling abuse at Semenyo in the Premier League opener against Liverpool was released on bail and told he cannot go within 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) of a soccer stadium in Britain while police investigate the incident.",
      "Soccer's tribal culture and frenzied fan base makes it a prime stage for societal problems like racism to surface. English soccer had a particularly harrowing time with racism in the 1970s and \u201980s when Black players were regularly subjected to monkey chants and offensive slurs.",
      "A generation later, racial abuse of players is more common in social media but also continues in stadiums. A high-profile example came in Spain in 2023 when Real Madrid's Vin\u00edcius J\u00fanior confronted a supporter who called him a monkey. Months earlier, four people hung an effigy of the Brazilian player off a highway bridge, resulting in prison sentences this year.",
      "Soccer\u2019s governing bodies have struggled to stamp out the problem, despite measures such as longer bans for players, heavier fines for clubs, partial stadium closures, points deductions and a three-step protocol used by referees when racism occurs in matches.",
      "FIFA recently fined the soccer federations of Albania, Serbia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina for offenses including racism during World Cup qualifiers they hosted in June. Argentina, Colombia and Chile also were punished for what FIFA said was \u201cdiscrimination and racist abuse.\"",
      "FIFA created a racism task force in 2013 but controversially disbanded it three years later, saying it had \u201ccompletely fulfilled its temporary mission.\"",

      "The NHL says the five players acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from an incident in 2018 will be eligible to sign a contract Oct. 15 and play Dec. 1",
      "NEW YORK -- The NHL is reinstating five players who were acquitted of sexual assault charges stemming from an incident in 2018 when they were members of Canada's world junior team, announcing Thursday they will be eligible to sign a contract Oct. 15 and take part in games Dec. 1.",
      "The move comes roughly seven weeks since Carter Hart, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube, Cal Foote and Alex Formenton were found not guilty by a judge in London, Ontario. The Canadian government told lawyers for the players last month it would not appeal the ruling.",
      "They were not in the NHL at the time of the incident.",
      "None of the players had current contracts and all are free agents. Hart was with Philadelphia, McLeod and Foote with New Jersey, and Dube with Calgary, while Formenton was playing in Europe, and their respective teams let their previous deals expire last year after charges were laid.",
      "The NHL conducted its own investigation beginning in the spring of 2022 when the allegations came to light. It called the events that transpired \u201cdeeply troubling and unacceptable\u201d and that while they were not found to be criminal, said the players' conduct did not meet the standard of moral integrity.",
      "The players met with league officials after the verdict and expressed regret and remorse, the NHL said. Keeping them from playing until Dec. 1 brings their total time away to nearly two years.",
      "The NHL Players' Association in a statement said it was pleased Dube, Foote, Formenton, Hart and McLeod are getting the opportunity to resume their careers.",
      "\u201cThe players cooperated with every investigation,\u201d the union said. \u201cUpon their full acquittal by Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia, we initiated discussions with the NHL regarding the players\u2019 return to work. To avoid a protracted dispute that would cause further delay, we reached the resolution that the league announced today. We now consider the matter closed and look forward to the players\u2019 return.\u201d",
      "Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, earlier in the week, said an update was coming \u201cin the relatively near future\" and declined to go into the contents of the investigative process.",
      "\u201cObviously, we take the matter very seriously, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s still under review,\u201d Daly said Tuesday in Las Vegas.",

      "Hart, McLeod, Dube and Foote last took part in NHL games in January 2024 before leaving their teams with charges pending.

      "USA Football is constantly on the hunt for talent to join the flag football team ahead of the 2028 Sumer Games in Los Angeles",
      "DENVER -- The basic flag-football player requirements are as follows: Swiveling hips for elusive jukes. Quick burst. Elite pass catching, throwing or defensive prowess.",
      "You know, pretty much those skills you see on display every week in NFL games. But it's not all that will make a player a prime roster pick down the road when flag football make its Olympic debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games.",
      "USA Football is taking a deep dive into just what skills and characteristics make an ideal flag-football player. The organization responsible for picking what's sure to be a star-studded roster is leaving nothing to chance to bring home a gold medal. It's always on the lookout for even more talent, no matter the level of football experience or even the sport.",
      "Time is ticking, too, because three Super Bowls from now, the Olympics will be on deck. Skills specific to flag football need to be honed \u2014 should any NFL player want to give it a go \u2014 and chemistry built (it's more nuanced than showing up for the Pro Bowl version).",
      "Because, \"not every single athlete is going to understand the nuances of the game of flag,\u201d said Charles Torwudzo, the head of player personnel at USA Football. \u201cSo that\u2019s going to be a big portion of it, as well as understanding of the game, the football IQ.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s easy to just assume NFL players will make up a bulk of the 10-player Olympic roster after the league voted in May to allow players to participate. But the NFL is still sorting out how to handle the logistics, especially since the Olympics fall in the middle of training camp.",
      "David White, the interim executive director of the NFL Players Association, recently told The Associated Press that, \u201cour players are like every other American citizen. So many of them would jump at the chance to represent their country.\u201d He added they haven't spoken directly to the league yet, \"but we look forward to doing so.\u201d",
      "Just don't overlook all those flag-football specialists. This is a men's squad that\u2019s won five straight International Federation of American Football world championships.",
      "USA Football relies on different data points to assess players at practices, camps and on game days. For instance, there's KPI (key performance indicators), an internal evaluation that measures variables such as burst, quickness, hip transition and body control. The organization also relies on readouts from Catapult, a wearable device that monitors everything from heart rate to speed.",
      "Although USA Football is always searching for more ways to crunch analytics, there's one indicator that's time-tested.",
      "\u201cHow well they play,\" Torwudzo said. \"How well they can get open, catch the ball and make plays.\u201d",
      "The next flag-football breakout sensation could be on an NFL practice squad right now. Or already a Pro Bowler. Maybe it's a recently retired player or someone playing in Canada. It might even be someone running track, playing rugby or lacrosse. Perhaps already on the U.S. flag football squad or in the flag-football system.",
      "Like a lot of NFL players, Arizona Cardinals safety Joey Blount is intrigued by flag football being an Olympic sport. He has the inside scoop on that version of football thanks to his college teammate at Virginia, Sean Moore, who's a receiver/rusher in the U.S. flag football pipeline.",
      "Blount has what flag football covets most \u2014 flexibility. Sure, he' a defensive back for Arizona, but he was a receiver and quarterback growing up.",
      "\u201cFootball can take me to the Olympics?\" Blount said. \"I would love to do that.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not as simple as rolling out there and fastening on the flags. There are subtle differences to the game.",

      "Through the years, there have been numerous NFL players who've gone to the Olympics. Some even brought home medals. But it's been in another sport such as track, bobsled or rugby.

      "Laval Davis is an example of how you can find talent in places away from the field. He was a track standout at Mississippi Valley State \u2014 home of Jerry Rice \u2014 winning several Southwestern Athletic Conference (SWAC) titles, including the 400-meter outdoor championships in 2019.",
      "He\u2019s a pass-rusher extraordinaire, with a lightning burst to the QB. He's also a reliable receiver. Davis started playing flag football six years ago and has been part of three world championship teams.",
      "From time to time, Davis has crossed paths with NFL players and they always ask the same sort of questions: What's flag football like? How tough is it to learn?",
      "\u201cI tell them all the times, \u2018It\u2019s really different,\u2019\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt's still football, but it\u2019s different types of movements and the schemes are different.\u201d",
      "The ideal player?",
      "\u201cHonestly, somebody who\u2019s just willing to learn and do what they have to do to help their teammates and boost the team up,\u201d Davis said. \u201cAs long as you can do what your number\u2019s called to do, that\u2019s all we really ask for.\u201d",

      "A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official\u2019s August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws \u2014 which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\u201d but didn't elaborate further. Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s government hasn\u2019t disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion along with other company officers at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",

      "But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \u201ca proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\u201d The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",

      "Goldsmith's decision that Dotcom should be extradited was made before the stroke. But Grice said the minister had considered other \u201csignificant health conditions\u201d Dotcom faced and wasn't wrong to conclude that these shouldn't prevent him from being deported.",

      "Scientists have discovered that octopuses don't have a dominant arm, but they more often use their front arms for tasks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Humans may be right-handed or left-handed. It turns out octopuses don't have a dominant arm, but they do tend to perform some tasks more often with their front arms, new research shows.",
      "Scientists studied a series of short videos of wild octopuses crawling, swimming, standing, fetching, and groping -- among other common activities -- to analyze how each of the eight arms were moving.",

      "Octopus limbs aren\u2019t specialized as many mammal limbs are. However, the three octopus species in the study showed a clear preference for using their four front arms, which they did about 60% of the time. The back arms were used more frequently for stilting and rolling that help move the octopus forward.",
      "\u201cThe forward arms do most of the exploring, the rear arms are mostly for walking,\u201d said Mike Vecchione, a Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History zoologist who was not involved in the study.",
      "Researchers analyzed video clips taken between 2007 and 2015 in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea. It was the first large study to examine precise limb actions in the wild.",
      "Unlike previous research of octopus behavior in a laboratory setting, the new work showed that octopuses did not show a preference for right or left arms in their natural environment.",
      "Results were published Thursday in Scientific Reports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m in awe that the researchers managed to do this,\u201d said Janet Voight, an octopus biologist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who had no role in the study.",

Now, anyone with the Zoox app will be able to request a ride to five designated locations, including Resorts World, the Luxor hotel and the New York-New York hotel. The longest distance the Zoox robotaxis will travel is about three miles (4.8 kilometers) while carrying up to four passengers.",
      "All rides will be provided for free for at least the first few months to help promote the existence of the service in the perennially popular travel destination. Once it begins charging for rides in Las Vegas, Zoox says its prices will be comparable to traditional taxis and ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft.",
      "Zoox can afford to give free rides largely because of Amazon's deep pockets. The e-commerce powerhouse, currently worth $2.5 trillion, bought Zoox for $1.2 billion five years ago as part of its efforts to establish a foothold in other fields of technology.",

      "NASA's Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- NASA\u2019s Mars rover Perseverance has uncovered rocks in a dry river channel that may hold potential signs of ancient microscopic life, scientists reported Wednesday.",
      "They stressed that in-depth analysis is needed of the sample gathered there by Perseverance \u2014 ideally in labs on Earth \u2014 before reaching any conclusions.",
      "Roaming Mars since 2021, the rover cannot directly detect life. Instead, it carries a drill to penetrate rocks and tubes to hold the samples gathered from places judged most suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. The samples are awaiting retrieval to Earth \u2014 an ambitious plan that's on hold as NASA seeks cheaper, quicker options.",
      "Calling it an \u201cexciting discovery,\u201d a pair of scientists who were not involved in the study \u2014 SETI Institute\u2019s Janice Bishop and the University of Massachusetts Amherst\u2019s Mario Parente \u2014 were quick to point out that non-biological processes could be responsible.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason why we can\u2019t go so far as to say, \u2018A-ha, this is proof positive of life,'\u2019\u2019 lead researcher Joel Hurowitz of Stony Brook University told The Associated Press. \u201cAll we can say is one of the possible explanations is microbial life, but there could be other ways to make this set of features that we see.\u201d",
      "Either way, Hurowitz said it\u2019s the best, most compelling candidate yet in the rover\u2019s search for potential signs of long-ago life. It was the 25th sample gathered; the tally is now up to 30, with six more to go.",
      "\u201cIt would be amazing to be able to demonstrate conclusively that these features were formed by something that was alive on another planet billions of years ago, right?\" Hurowitz said. But even if that's not the case, it's \"a valuable lesson in all of the ways that nature can conspire to fool us.\u201d",
      "Collected last summer, the sample is from reddish, clay-rich mudstones in Neretva Vallis, a river channel that once carried water into Jezero Crater. This outcrop of sedimentary rock, known as the Bright Angel formation, was surveyed by Perseverance\u2019s science instruments before the drill came out.",
      "Along with organic carbon, a building block of life, Hurowitz and his team found minuscule specks, dubbed poppy seeds and leopard spots, that were enriched with iron phosphate and iron sulfide. On Earth, these chemical compounds are the byproducts when microorganisms chomp down on organic matter.",
      "The findings appeared in the journal Nature.",

On Tuesday, that list expanded to include the Europe India Gateway cable as well, said Doug Madory, director of internet analysis at the firm Kentik.",
      "Initial reporting suggested the cut happened off the coast of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, something authorities in the kingdom have not acknowledged, nor have the companies managing the cables.",
      "\u201cEarly independent analysis indicates that the probable cause of damage is commercial shipping activity in the region,\u201d John Wrottesley, the committee's operations manager, told the AP. \u201cDamage to submarine cables from dragged anchors account for approximately 30% of incidents each year representing around 60 faults.\u201d",

      "Nepal's crackdown on social media companies, which led to protests and police killing at least 19 people, is part of a yearslong decline of internet freedoms around the world as even democracies seek to curtail online speech.",
      "The Himalayan country\u2019s government said last week it was blocking several social media platforms including Facebook, X and YouTube because the companies failed to comply with a requirement that they register with the government. The ban was lifted Tuesday a day after the deadly protests.",
      "What's happening in Nepal mirrors \u201cthis broader pattern of controlling the narrative and controlling of stories emerging from the ground,\u201d said Aditya Vashistha, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. \u201cThis has happened several times in the neighboring countries India, Pakistan, Bangladesh. So this is nothing new \u2014 in fact, I would say this is taken from the playbook, which is now very established, of trying to control social media narratives.\u201d",
      "Like neighboring countries, Nepal's government have been asking the companies to appoint a liaison in the country. Officials are calling for laws to to monitor social media and ensure both the users and operators are responsible and accountable for what they share. But the move has been criticized as a tool for censorship and punishing opponents who voice their protests online.",
      "\u201cGovernments absolutely have a valid interest in seeking to regulate social media platforms. This is such a daily part of our lives and in our business. And it is certainly reasonable for authorities to sit down and say we want to develop rules for the road,\u201d said Kian Vesteinsson, senior research analyst for technology and democracy at the Washington-based nonprofit Freedom House.",
      "\u201cBut what we see in Nepal is that wholesale blocks as a means of enforcing a set of rules for social media companies results in wildly disproportionate harms. These measures that were put in place in Nepal (cut) tens of millions of people off from platforms that they used to express themselves, to conduct daily business, to speak with their families, to go to school, to get healthcare information.\u201d",
      "It's not just Nepal. Freedom House has found that global internet freedom has declined for the 14th consecutive year in 2024, as governments crack down on dissent and people face arrest for expressing political, social or religious views online. While China consistently tops the list as the \u201cworld's worst environment\u201d for internet freedom, last year Myanmar shared this designation as well. The organization did not track Nepal.",
      "India passed a telecommunications law in 2023 that gave its government \u201cbroad powers to restrict online communications and intercept communications,\" according to Freedom House. Three years earlier, a sweeping internet law put digital platforms like Facebook under direct government oversight. Officials say the rules are needed to quell misinformation and hate speech and to give users more power to flag objectionable content. But critics cautioned it would lead to censorship in a country where digital freedoms have already been shrinking.",
      "In January, meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s lower house of parliament passed a bill that gives the government sweeping controls on social media, including sending users to prison for spreading disinformation.",
      "Calling internet freedom a \u201cpillar of modern democracy,\u201d Freedom House said a healthy 21st-century democracy cannot function without a trustworthy online environment, where people can access information and express themselves freely.",
      "Increasingly, though, governments are putting up roadblocks.",

      "Often, regulations are in the name of child safety, cyber crime or fraud, Vesteinsson said, \u201cbut unfortunately, a lot of this regulation comes hand in hand with restrictive measures.\u201d",
      "In the Nepali law, for instance, \u201cthe same provision of this law, directs social media platforms to restrict content relating to child trafficking and human trafficking and labor, a really important issue,\" he added. \"Two bullet points above that, it orders platforms to restrict people from posting anonymously.\u201d",
      "The Committee to Protect Journalists said Monday that the protests \u201cunderscore the widespread concerns over Nepal\u2019s ban on social media and the pressing need for the government to drop its order. Such a sweeping ban not only restricts freedom of expression, it also severely hinders journalists\u2019 work and the public\u2019s right to know.\u201d",
      "The crackdown appears to have spurred a surge in use of virtual private networks, or VPNs, according to Proton, which provides encrypted services. Signups for Proton\u2019s VPN service in Nepal have jumped by 8,000% since Sept. 3, according to data the company posted online. A VPN is a service that allows users to mask their location in order to circumvent censorship or geography-based online viewing restrictions.",
      "But experts caution that VPNs are not an end-all solution to government internet blocks. They can be expensive and out of reach for many people, Vashistha noted, and they can be slow and lead to lower-quality experiences when people try to access blocked social platforms.",
      "Google, Meta, X and TikTok (which registered and continues to operate) didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "Vesteinsson said companies can take important steps to safeguard privacy of their users \u2014 particularly human rights defenders and activists who might be a specific target for government repression in their countries.",

The public outrage over the ban and the deaths of 19 protesters on Monday led to the resignation of the prime minister and exposed deep discontent over corruption.",

      "Led by mostly teenagers and young adults, the protests revealed a broader resentment in Nepal, where many people have increasingly become angry with the government over a range of issues, mostly to do with corruption and frustration over nepotism in the country\u2019s politics.",
      "\u201cProtests over the social media ban were just a catalyst. Frustrations over how the country is being run have long been simmering under the surface. People are very angry and Nepal finds itself in a very precarious situation,\u201d said Prateek Pradhan, editor of Baahrakhari, a Nepalese independent news website.",
      "Demonstrations in Nepal have been called the protest of Gen Z, which generally refers to people born between 1995 and 2010.

      "A new study finds that climate change is increasing sugar consumption in the United States",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global warming in the United States is amping up the country's sweet tooth, a new study found.",
      "When the temperature rises, Americans \u2014 especially those with less money and education \u2014 drink lots more sugary beverages and a bit more frozen desserts. That amounts to more than 100 million pounds of added sugar (358 million kilograms) consumed in the nation a year, compared to 15 years earlier, according to a team of researchers in the U.S. and United Kingdom.",
      "When temperatures go between 54 and 86 degrees (12 and 30 degrees Celsius), the amount of sugar the average American consumes goes up by about 0.4 grams per degree Fahrenheit (0.7 grams per degree Celsius) per day, based on researchers tracking of weather conditions and consumers' purchases. At 54 degrees, the amount of added sugar for the average American is a little more than 2 grams. At 86 degrees, it\u2019s more than 15 grams.",
      "Beyond that, appetites lessen and added sugar falls off, according to the study in Monday's Nature Climate Change.",
      "\u201cClimate change is shaping what you eat and how you eat and that might have a bad effect on your health,\u201d said study co-author Duo Chan, a climate scientist at the University of Southampton.",
      "\u201cPeople tend to take in more sweetened beverages as the temperature is getting higher and higher,\u201d Chan said. \u201cObviously under a warming climate that would cause you to drink more or take in more sugar. And that is going to be a severe problem when it comes to health.\u201d",
      "The daily difference from higher temperatures doesn't amount to even a single candy bar for the average person. But it adds up over time and has a big effect, said University of California San Francisco endocrinology professor Dr. Robert Lustig, a specialist in pediatrics and obesity who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Lustig wrote in an email that among poorer Americans, just one added can of sugary soft drink per day increases diabetes risk by 29% \u2014 and temperature-related thirst plays a big part in America\u2019s obesity epidemic.",
      "The United States\u2019 average annual temperature has gone up about 2.2 degrees (1.2 degrees Celsius) since 1895, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "To chart the impact on sugar consumption, researchers compared it to the American Heart Association recommendations: limiting daily intake to 36 grams for men and 25 grams for women.",
      "The team then compared wind, precipitation and humidity records to the detailed purchase records of 40,000 to 60,000 American households from 2004 to 2019, not using any data after the pandemic hit. Then they looked at the nutritional information of the items bought. That allowed them to eliminate other factors to make a causal link and come up with a calculation for how much extra sugar is consumed per person per degree, said lead author Pan He, an environmental scientist at Cardiff University.",

      "The researchers found that men consumed more sugary soft drinks, and that the amount of added sugar consumed during hot weather was several times higher for low- and very low-income families than for the wealthiest, the study found.",
      "People who work outside drank more sugary drinks than those who work inside, and the same went for families where the head of the household was less educated. White people have the highest added sugar effect, while Asians showed no significant change in added sugar in the heat.",
      "Lustig said sugary drinks are marketed and priced in a way to attract the poor, and in many disadvantaged communities the water tastes funny because of chemicals in them. Poor people are also less likely to have air conditioning and are more likely to work outside and need more hydration, Lustig and He said.",
      "\u201cIt should concern us that the rate of the impact is larger in households where people make less money or are less educated,\u201d said Dr. Courtney Howard, vice chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance. \u201cThese groups tend to have lower baseline health status, so this is an area where climate-related changes appear to magnify existing health inequalities.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- On a recent sunny morning in a channel at the Port of Los Angeles, seven blue steel structures that look like small boats are lowered into the ocean one by one. Attached to an unused wharf on a site that once housed oil tanks, they gently bob up and down with the waves to generate renewable power. Nearby, a sea lion peeks from the water and pelicans and sea gulls soar overhead.",
      "This is the nation\u2019s first onshore wave energy site, and on Tuesday, Eco Wave Power will officially unveil the pilot installation and begin operating. The pilot will generate just a small amount of electricity that can be used locally, but the larger goal is to prove the technology works well enough to expand along 8 miles of breakwater at the port \u2014 enough to power up to 60,000 homes.",
      "Co-founder and CEO Inna Braverman said that much power could be a \u201cgame changer in terms of clean energy production\u201d for the port and the communities around it. America\u2019s shipping ports have long struggled with dirty air that harms the health of people living nearby.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re starting here in LA, but we hope, aspire and believe that we will be in the United States and in other locations around the world,\u201d she said, standing outside a blue shipping container serving as the project\u2019s power station.",
      "Wave energy is an emerging industry that\u2019s largely still focused on research, demonstration and pilot projects. But the potential is big.",
      "Waves off the coasts of the United States generate enough power to meet roughly one-third of America\u2019s energy needs, according to Department of Energy estimates. Even if only a portion is harnessed, wave energy technologies could help meet the growing demand for electricity being driven in large part by the artificial intelligence race. Wave energy could also complement wind and solar to stabilize the electric grid.",
      "Eco Wave Power installed its technology at the port\u2019s AltaSea ocean institute, a nonprofit that is working in part to advance ocean-based solutions to climate change. Half this pilot project was funded by the oil and gas company Shell.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the first U.S. project on breakwater, so it opens up the possibility to do that on multiple other ports in the U.S.,\u201d said R\u00e9mi Gruet, CEO of the trade association Ocean Energy Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s a moment where wave power is starting to turn from innovation projects to actual pilot projects that go toward industrialization and commercialization.\u201d",
      "A key advantage for wave energy is it produces electricity at different times than wind and solar, Gruet said. For example, when the wind stops blowing, wind turbines will stop generating electricity. But waves will carry on for hours and electricity can still be generated that way, he said.",
      "But the cost needs to come down with the help of subsidies, like it has for solar and wind, Gruet added.",
      "The first commercial wave power plant in Europe started operating in 2011 from a breakwater at Mutriku harbor in Spain. An offshore wave energy system came online off the coast of Hawaii in 2016.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill in 2023 to promote wave energy development in the state. Eco Wave Power currently has a two-year license to operate the pilot station at the Port of Los Angeles.",
      "As the small blue floats bob up and down, each pushes a cylinder that sends a biodegradable hydraulic fluid through a system of pipes into storage tanks. Pressure in the tanks builds up. That pressure turns a motor, which turns a generator, producing clean electricity.",

      "\u201cAnd we can harness all of that clean energy now, thanks to things like Eco Wave,\u201d he said.",
      "Braverman said there are dozens of sites along the U.S. coastline, identified through a study paid for by Shell, where her company could harness wave energy to add clean electricity to the grid. She said the technology is easy to adopt because unlike other renewables, this system doesn\u2019t require any land acquisition, it involves repurposing existing structures rather than altering coastlines and it can generate electricity around the clock.",
      "The Eco Wave pilot did require licensing from the Army Corps of Engineers and from the port, but that came in a relatively quick two years, Braverman said.",
      "Eco Wave Power is also working on projects abroad, including Taiwan, India and Portugal, and operating a grid-connected project in Israel. In New Jersey, where legislation is advancing to promote ocean energy development in the state, the company is looking for a site to install a pilot project, with help from elected officials.",

      "The cuts to the lines come as Yemen's Houthi rebels remain locked in a series of attacks targeting Israel over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Israel has responded with airstrikes, including one that killed top leaders within the rebel movement.",
      "In early 2024, Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government in exile alleged that the Houthis planned to attack undersea cables in the Red Sea. Several were cut, possibly by a ship attacked by the Houthis dragging its anchor, but the rebels denied being responsible. On Sunday morning, the Houthis' al-Masirah satellite news channel acknowledged that the cuts had taken place, citing NetBlocks.",
      "Moammar al-Eryani, the information minister with Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government that opposes the Houthis and is based in southern Yemen, issued a statement saying the cable cuts \u201ccannot be isolated from the series of direct attacks carried out by the Houthi militia.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat is happening today in the Red Sea should serve as a wake-up call for the international community, which must take a firm stance to stop these escalating threats and protect the digital infrastructure that serves as the lifeline of the modern world,\u201d al-Eryani said.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sunk four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Iranian-backed Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels. The Houthis sank two vessels in July, killing at least four on board, with others believed to be held by the rebels.",
      "The Houthis\u2019 new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in which the Americans bombed three Iranian atomic sites.",

      "Artificial intelligence is transforming call centers by streamlining tasks and improving customer service",
      "NEW YORK -- Armen Kirakosian remembers the frustrations of his first job as a call center agent nearly 10 years ago: the aggravated customers, the constant searching through menus for information and the notes he had to physically write for each call he handled.",
      "Thanks to artificial intelligence, the 29-year-old from Athens, Greece, is no longer writing notes or clicking on countless menus. He often has full customer profiles in front of him when a person calls in and may already know what problem the customer has before even saying \u201chello.\u201d He can spend more time actually serving the customer.",
      "\u201cA.I. has taken (the) robot out of us,\u201d Kirakosian said.",
      "Roughly 3 million Americans work in call center jobs, and millions more work in call centers around the world, answering billions of inquiries a year about everything from broken iPhones to orders for shoes. Kirakosian works for TTEC, a company that provides third party customer service lines in 22 countries to companies in industries such as autos and banking that need extra capacity or have outsourced their call center operations.",
      "Answering these calls can be thankless work. Roughly half of all customer service agents leave the job after a year, according to McKinsey, with stress and monotonous work being among the reasons employees quit.",
      "Much of what these agents deal with is referred to in the industry as \u201cbreak/fix,\u201d which means something is broken \u2014 or wrong or confusing \u2014 and the customer expects the person on the phone to fix the problem. Now, it\u2019s a question of who will be tasked with the fix: a human, a computer, or a human augmented by a computer.",
      "Already, AI agents have taken over more routine call center tasks. Some jobs have been lost and there have been dire forecasts about the future job market for these individuals, ranging from modest single-percentage point losses, to as many as half of all call center jobs going away in the next decade. The drop likely won't match the more dire predictions, however, because it's become evident that the industry will still need humans, perhaps with even higher levels of learning and training, as some customer service issues become increasingly harder to solve.",
      "Some finance companies have already experimented with going in heavily with AI for their customer service issues.",
      "Klarna, the Swedish buy now, pay later company, replaced 700 of their roughly 3,000 customer service agents with chatbots and AI in 2024. The results were mixed. While the company did save money, Klarna found there was still a need for higher skilled human agents in certain circumstances, such as complicated issues related to identity theft. Earlier this year, Klarna hired seven internal freelancers to handle these issues.",
      "Earlier this year, Klarna hired a handful of customer service employees back to the firm, acknowledging there were certain issues that AI couldn\u2019t handle as well as a real person, like identity theft.",
      "\u201cOur vision of an AI-first contact center, where AI agents handle the majority of conversations and fewer, better trained and better paid human agents support only the most complex tasks, is quickly becoming a reality,\u201d said Gadi Shamia of Replicant, an AI-software company that trains chatbots to sound more human, in an interview with consultants at McKinsey.",

      "The call center customer's experience, while improved, is still far from perfect.",
      "The initial customer service call has long been handled through interactive voice response systems, known in the industry as IVR. Customers interact with IVR when they're told \u201cpress one for sales, press two for support, press five for billing.\u201d These crude systems got an update in the 2010s, when customers could prompt the system by saying \u201csales\u201d or \u201csupport\u201d or simple phrases like \u201cI\u2019d like to pay a bill\u201d instead of navigating through a labyrinthian set of menu options.",
      "But customers have little patience for these menus, leading them to \u201czero out,\u201d which is call center slang for when a customer hits the zero button on their their keypad in hopes of reaching a human. It\u2019s also not uncommon that after a customer \u201czeros out\u201d they will be put on hold and transferred because they did not end up in the right place for their request.",
      "Aware of Americans' collective impatience with IVR, Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Republican Jim Justice of West Virginia have introduced the \u201cKeep Call Centers in America Act,\u201d which would require clear ways to reach a human agent, and provide incentives to companies that keep call center jobs in the U.S.",
      "Companies are trying to roll out telephone systems that broadly understand customer service requests and predict where to send a customer without navigating a menu. OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, is coming out with its \u201cChatGPT Agent\u201d service for users that\u2019s able to understand phrases like \u201cI need to find a hotel for a wedding next year, please give me options for clothing and gifts.\u201d",
      "Bank of America says it has had increasing success in integrating such features into \u201cErica,\u201d its chatbot that debuted in 2018. When Erica cannot handle a request, the agent transfers the customer directly to the right department. Erica is now also predictive and analytical, and knows for instance that a customer may repeatedly have a low balance and may need better help budgeting or may have multiple subscriptions to the same service.",
      "Bank of America said this month that Erica has been used 3 billion times since its creation and is increasingly taking on a higher case load of customer service requests. The chatbot's moniker comes from the last five letters of the company's name.",
      "James Bednar, vice president of product and innovation at TTEC, has spent much of his career trying to make customer service calls less painful for the caller as well as the company. He said these tools could eventually kill off IVR for good, ending the need for anyone to \u201czero out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're getting to the point where AI will get you to the right person for your problem without you having to route through those menus,\u201d Bednar said.",

      "Although lockdowns have since been lifted, schools that received the threats continue to act with an abundance of caution. In an era of mass shootings \u2014 and following a wave of violence Wednesday and a spate of hoax calls about active shooters at the start of the school year \u2014 some universities opted to call off classes for the rest of the week and send students home.",

At Alabama State University, which sits near downtown Montgomery and has an enrollment of about 3,500, students were ordered to shelter-in-place as police searched each building on campus.",
      "About two hours later, the university said that it had received the \u201call-clear\u201d from police. However, the school said that while the \u201cimmediate threat has been resolved\u201d students were asked to shelter in place in their dorms and classes were cancelled for the remainder of the day.",

      "Authorities say church leaders exploited soldiers and other congregation members by enrolling them in seminary programs that drained their G.I. Bill education benefits. They also say church officials used parishioners' names on fraudulent mortgage applications to buy homes that the church then rented to congregation members.",
      "\u201cThe defendants are accused of exploiting trust, faith, and even the service of our nation\u2019s military members to enrich themselves,\u201d Paul Brown, the agent in charge of the FBI's Atlanta office, said in a news release.",
      "Prosecutors say they don't even know the real name of Denis, alleging he assumed that name after stealing another person's identity in 1983. He founded House of Prayer roughly two decades ago. The church is headquartered in Hinesville, a southeast Georgia city that is home to thousands of veterans and Army soldiers serving at neighboring Fort Stewart. The congregation there grew to as many as 300 members, the indictment says.",
      "House of Prayer branched out, opening up to a dozen churches in five states, often near military bases, according to prosecutors. It also established affiliated Bible seminaries in Hinesville as well as Fayetteville, North Carolina; Killeen, Texas; and Tacoma, Washington.",

      "Charges against Denis and others stem from just $3.2 million of those benefit payments made to House of Prayer's two seminaries in Georgia. That is because the programs operated in Georgia under a religious exemption granted by state regulators. Prosecutors say that exemption prohibited the Georgia seminaries from receiving federal funding \u2014 including G.I. Bill benefits from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.",

      "The unusual facts of the case \u2014 including gold bars, cash and a Mercedes-Benz \u2014 and breast cancer surgery that led to Nadine Menendez facing trial a year later than her husband teed up a surprising scenario: The then-senator's lawyers tried to pin the blame on her. But at her sentencing, Nadine Menendez said Bob Menendez was a manipulative liar who \u201cstrung me like a puppet.\u201d",

As a member of Congress, Menendez was prohibited from being an agent of a foreign government. Authorities said it was the first time the charge was brought against a sitting member of Congress, signaling that U.S. national security was at stake.",
      "It was the second federal case against Menendez after a jury deadlocked in 2017 on corruption charges in New Jersey. Prosecutors did not seek to retry him.",
      "He had held public office continuously since 1986, serving as a state legislator before 13 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 2006 then-New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine appointed Menendez to the Senate seat he vacated when he became governor.",
      "Unusual upbringings and family traditions. Neither testified at trial, but both asserted through their lawyers that there were innocent explanations for the loot.",

      "School choice has resurfaced as a hotly debated issue in Kentucky",
      "School choice resurfaced Thursday as a hotly debated issue in Kentucky, where the state's highest court heard arguments in a bitter dispute over the constitutionality of a measure to publicly fund charter schools.",
      "The measure, known as House Bill 9, was enacted by the state's GOP-dominated legislature in 2022 over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's veto. It would funnel taxpayer dollars to support charter schools. It was struck down by a lower court judge, setting up the climactic review by the Kentucky Supreme Court.",
      "The outcome could decide whether charter schools gain a foothold in the Bluegrass State.",
      "Supporters say charter schools offer another choice for parents looking for the best educational fit for their children. A goal, they say, is to close student achievement gaps. Opponents say such schools would divert needed funds from existing public schools and could pick and choose which students to accept.",
      "Charter schools are operated by independent groups with fewer regulations than most public schools. They have been legal in Kentucky since 2017, but none have opened because of the lack of a method to fund them. The disputed law enacted a few years later was meant to fill that funding gap and mandated the opening of charter schools on a pilot basis in Louisville and northern Kentucky.",
      "Kentucky is among a handful of states where charter school's don't operate.",
      "\u201cSo Kentucky kids are really on the outside looking in, on what has been a resounding success \u2014 especially in urban areas,\u201d state Solicitor General Matt Kuhn said in defending the disputed law during the hearing in Danville, Kentucky.",
      "Byron Leet, one of two attorneys presenting for education groups opposed to the measure, countered that \"there is nothing remotely resembling a consensus that charter schools are a wonderful thing.\u201d",
      "Arguments focused on whether charter schools meet the constitutional standards of public schools.",
      "Charter schools would have to comply with student attendance standards, hire certified teachers, meet state standards for student performance and adhere to open records and open meetings laws, Kuhn said.",
      "\u201cI think that House Bill 9 fits neatly in our tradition\" of public schools, he said.",
      "Leet responded that charter schools would be \u201cautonomous in matters of finance, personnel, curriculum and instruction \u2014 four very significant areas for any school.\"",
      "\"They are on an island by themselves as far as how they will operate,\" he added.",
      "The Supreme Court justices weighed in with a series of questions for attorneys on both sides. Some questions drilled down into matters of accountability and oversight for charter schools.",

      "An underlying test for public schools, based on decades of legal precedents, is whether they are controlled by elected officials within a school district, Leet said. Charter schools, meanwhile, would be operated by independent boards whose members would not be elected by local voters, he said.",
      "Kuhn noted that, in most instances, the local school board would serve as the authorizing body for a proposed charter school in the district, resulting in significant local control.",
      "He said it would be up to parents to decide whether to send their children to a charter school.",
      "\u201cTheir kids only go there if they choose,\" he said. \"And our submission would be that\u2019s the best form of accountability \u2014 given that we presume that parents know best for their kids.\u201d",
      "Hanging over the case was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed state lawmakers to appropriate tax dollars for educational opportunities outside the public school system. That ballot measure was overwhelmingly defeated by statewide voters in the 2024 general election.",
      "\u201cShould that impact our decision, or should we just ignore the nearly two-thirds of the voters who do not wish to have taxpayer funds used in this manner?\u201d Justice Pamela R. Goodwine asked.",
      "That outcome doesn't apply to charter schools because they wouldn't be outside the public school system, attorneys defending the charter school law said.",
      "The justices did not indicate how soon they will rule on the matter.",
      "Two of the state's top leaders weighed after the court hearing.",
      "Beshear, the state's two-term governor who is widely seen as a potential contender for the White House in 2028, said the way to improve student performance is to increase state education funding and to look at giving existing public schools the type of regulatory flexibility envisioned for charter schools.",
      "\u201cThe answer can't be to divert just some small group of students to some different system,\u201d Beshear said at a news conference in Frankfort, the state's capital. \u201cThe answer has to be one that lifts everyone up, and that is better investing in our public school system.\u201d",
      "Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman, whose office is defending the charter school funding law, said Kentucky parents deserve the same options as those in states where charter schools operate.",
      "\"Kentucky\u2019s kids deserve every chance to succeed, and we\u2019re proud to stand alongside our partners in the General Assembly to fight for that opportunity,\u201d he said in a statement.",

      "A Maine principals' group is resisting a U.S. Department of Justice subpoena seeking the names of all students playing interscholastic sports",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- A Maine principals' group is fighting a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice that seeks the names of all students playing interscholastic sports in the state as the DOJ attempts to ban transgender athletes from participating.",
      "President Donald Trump's administration sued Maine in April for not complying with an executive order barring transgender athletes from sports. The Justice Department followed up with a subpoena of the Maine Principals' Association, a nonprofit that oversees school sports in Maine, seeking a host of information.",
      "The full scope of the subpoena isn't public because a judge sealed it. However, in a Sept. 4 legal filing, the principals' association said the subpoena included \u201crequests for the production of all athletic rosters for the state,\" and would require providing \"personally identifiable information of students, many of whom are unrelated to the underlying controversy.\"",
      "The principals' association asked the judge to reject the subpoena, and that request is pending in federal court. James Belleau, an attorney for the association, said Thursday that the group is willing to provide documents in response to the subpoena, but not those that are overly broad or disclose personally identifiable information.",
      "\u201cThe MPA will protect confidential student names and records and school personnel,\u201d Belleau said.",
      "DOJ officials did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for the Office of the Maine Attorney General also declined to comment on the case.",

      "The federal government's filing stated that its requests include records for athletic competitions where students are competing in athletic events designated for the opposite sex. It also states that the request for athletic rosters is \u201cnecessary background evidence\u201d for the case.",
      "Maine and the federal government have sparred over the subject of transgender participation in sports since a February meeting at the White House that included a confrontation between the state's Democratic Gov. Janet Mills and Trump. During the meeting of governors, Trump threatened to pull funding from Maine if the state did not comply with his order banning transgender athletes.",
      "Mills told the president: \u201cWe'll see you in court.\u201d The U.S. Department of Education later said in March that an investigation concluded Maine violated the Title IX antidiscrimination law by allowing transgender girls to compete on girls\u2019 sports teams and use girls\u2019 facilities.",
      "Maine officials said in April that the state still won't comply with the ban, and the federal government referred its investigation to the Justice Department.",

      "North Carolina's Republican legislative leaders are pushing for stricter pretrial release laws after a Ukrainian refugee was fatally stabbed on a Charlotte train",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's top legislative leaders said Thursday that they are aiming to advance a package of proposed laws in part designed to tighten pretrial release rules following the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train that prompted national attention and calls for tougher-on-crime policies.",
      "More oversight of and less discretion for local magistrates who make decisions on criminal suspects \u2014 like the man now accused of murder in last month's death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 likely will be introduced when the Republican-controlled General Assembly reconvenes Sept. 22.",
      "\u201cWe must deliver justice for Iryna and the countless families across our state that have fallen victim to a justice system that does not support them and does not keep them safe,\u201d Senate leader Phil Berger said at a Legislative Building news conference.",
      "The package \u2014 outlines of which were offered by Berger and House Speaker Destin Hall \u2014 also could include an effort to restart the death penalty in the state and prevent the governor and other executive branch officials from creating commissions that Berger contends encourage local policies favoring perpetrators. He mentioned a task force established in 2020 by then-Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper addressing racial inequities in the criminal justice system following the death of George Floyd.",
      "The suspect in Zarutska's stabbing, Decarlos Brown Jr., was arrested soon after the Aug. 22 attack. But last week's release of train video showing what looked like a random attack brought criticism from President Donald Trump and conservative activists who blamed government and judicial officials.",
      "Brown had a lengthy criminal record that included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon. In January he was charged with misusing the 911 system, and a Mecklenburg County magistrate released him on the misdemeanor without requiring bond on a written promise to return for court.",
      "A 2023 state law that was backed by Charlotte-area law enforcement officials required judges, not magistrates, to set conditions for pretrial release for certain violent offenders, and not magistrates. But Hall said Brown should have never been allowed to leave custody in January given his criminal history and mental health concerns. He and Berger also said eliminating the option for county magistrates to grant cashless bail for defendants with past violent felony convictions would result in more consistency in decisions.",

      "Berger said Thursday that he is also looking at ways to restart capital punishment. Brown\u2019s first-degree murder count is punishable by life in prison or death. North Carolina has not carried out an execution since 2006, as legal challenges over the use of lethal injection drugs and a doctor\u2019s presence at executions have in part delayed action. U.S. prosecutors have also charged Brown with a federal crime that carries up to life in prison or the death penalty.",

      "Republicans are taking the first steps to change the rules of the Senate to confirm more of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans are taking the first steps to change the chamber\u2019s rules on Thursday, making it easier to confirm groups of President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees and overcome Democratic delays.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune\u2019s move is the latest salvo after a dozen years of gradual changes by both parties to weaken the filibuster and make the nominations process more partisan. He has said the Democrats\u2019 obstruction is \u201cunsustainable\u201d as they have drawn out the confirmation process and infuriated Trump as many positions in his administration have remained unfilled.",
      "Opening up the Senate, Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said that the delays have prevented the Senate from spending time on legislative business.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to fix this today, and restore the longtime Senate precedent of expeditious confirmation, and the Senate\u2019s role as first and foremost a legislative body,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Republicans are taking a series of procedural votes Thursday on a group of 48 of Trump\u2019s nominees, and are expected to vote to \u201coverturn the chair,\u201d or change the rules, which takes a simple majority vote. If all goes according to their plan, the nominees \u2014 undersecretaries and staff positions for various agencies across the government as well as several ambassadors \u2014 could be confirmed by next week.",
      "The rules change effort comes as both parties have obstructed the other\u2019s nominees for years, and as both Republicans and Democrats have advocated speeding the process when they are in the majority. The Republican rules change stops short of speeding up votes on high-level Cabinet officials and lifetime judicial appointments, and it is loosely based on a proposal from Democrats under President Joe Biden.",
      "Republicans have been pushing the rules change since early August, when the Senate left for a monthlong recess after a breakdown in bipartisan negotiations over the confirmation process and Trump told Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to \u201cGO TO HELL!\u201d on social media.",

      "Democrats have blocked more nominees than ever before as they have struggled to find ways to oppose Trump and the GOP-dominated Congress, and as their voters have pushed them to fight Republicans at every turn. It\u2019s the first time in recent history that the minority party hasn\u2019t allowed at least some quick confirmations.",
      "Schumer has said Democrats are delaying the nominations because Trump\u2019s nominees are \u201chistorically bad.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t debate nominees, if you don\u2019t vote on individual nominees, if there\u2019s not some degree of sunlight, what will stop Donald Trump from nominating even worse individuals than we\u2019ve seen to date, knowing this chamber will rubber stamp anything he wishes?\u201d Schumer said Monday.",
      "Schumer told Republicans that they will \u201ccome to regret\u201d their action \u2014 echoing a similar warning from GOP Leader Mitch McConnell to then-Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., in 2013, when Democrats changed Senate rules for executive branch and lower court judicial nominees to remove the 60-vote threshold for confirmations. At the time, Republicans were blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s picks.",
      "Republicans took the Senate majority a year later, and McConnell eventually did the same for Supreme Court nominees in 2017 as Democrats tried to block Trump\u2019s nomination of Justice Neil Gorsuch.",
      "\u201cI say to my Republican colleagues, think carefully before taking this step,\u201d Schumer said.",

      "A presidential visit always prompts extra security at sporting events, but things were heightened after conservative activist and close Trump ally Charlie Kirk was assassinated in Utah on Wednesday. When Trump attended the Sept. 11 observance ceremony at the Pentagon earlier Thursday, authorities moved the ceremony inside as an added precaution.",
      "Trump's attendance at the Yankees game on Sept. 11 recalled President George W. Bush's ceremonial first pitch 24 years earlier as the Yankees played the Arizona Diamondbacks in the 2001 World Series \u2014 a moment that came to symbolize national resilience after the attacks mere weeks earlier.",
      "Since the attacks, the Yankees and their fans have marked Sept. 11 during the seventh-inning stretch by singing \u201cGod Bless America\u201d in addition to the traditional \u201cTake Me Out to the Ballgame,\u201d and they were doing so again Thursday.",
      "Even before Trump left the White House, security at the stadium was tight. Every entrance featured metal detectors and Secret Service agents, some with sniffer dogs, while New York Police Department helicopters thundered overhead.",
      "Stadium authorities opened the gates three hours before the first pitch, and long lines began forming even before that, though most of the crowd appeared to be moving into the stadium smoothly. The Yankees said ticketholders were \u201cstrongly urged to arrive as early as possible.\u201d",
      "The Secret Service also posted a statement saying extra time would be necessary and asking fans to \u201cconsider leaving your bags at home to help speed up the security screening process.\u201d",
      "Trump's attendance at the U.S. Open men's final in Queens last weekend sparked security lines long enough that some fans didn\u2019t make it to their seats until more than an hour into the match, despite organizers delaying its start by 30 minutes.",

      "The New Orleans Archdiocese has agreed to a $230 million settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans Archdiocese on Monday agreed to a $230 million proposed settlement for survivors of clergy sexual abuse, attorneys for some of the survivors said Monday. The agreement paves the way for a final resolution to yearslong negotiations amid a series of similar settlements from the Catholic Church.",
      "The archdiocese had announced in May that it would pay at least $179.2 million in response to more than 500 abuse claims, which the bloc of attorneys said they opposed because they considered it to be lowballing the hundreds of survivors.",
      "\u201cWe knew this was a bad deal, and we knew we could do better; and we have,\" the group of 10 attorneys said in a statement. \"The \u2018power of no\u2019 forced the Archdiocese to come up with significantly more money.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese had filed for bankruptcy in May 2020 rather than handle each abuse claim separately, which survivors point out allows church leadership to avoid facing tough questions in court. The archdiocese called the updated settlement a \u201csignificant step forward for the benefit of all claimant survivors\" in an emailed statement.",
      "Survivors have until late October to vote on whether or not to approve the settlement. If approved by two-thirds of survivors, payments could begin disbursement by next year.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m not aware of a single attorney for an abuse survivor that opposes the plan,\u201d said Brad Knapp, an attorney for a committee representing abuse survivors. \u201cWith all the abuse survivors\u2019 attorneys supporting it, I think there\u2019s much less chance that it gets voted down.\u201d",
      "The archdiocese's bankruptcy is one of the longest running and most contentious of more than a dozen ongoing Catholic Church bankruptcy cases in the U.S. related to sex abuse, according to Terence McKiernan, president of the nonprofit BishopAccountability.org.",
      "Judge Meredith Grabill, overseeing the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, has warned that if the settlement is not approved, then she will dismiss the case.",
      "If a bankruptcy settlement fails, survivors would be required to seek compensation for their abuse claims through new lawsuits, which could take years to play out in courts. And it raises the prospect that the archdiocese would declare bankruptcy again to delay payments, according to a public letter from the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors. The committee represents the interests of abuse survivors in the bankruptcy case and urged survivors to accept the initial settlement offer.",
      "The committee warned that bringing individual abuse claims in court would likely lead to difficult confrontations with a \u201caggressive and hostile\u201d archdiocese, which could force survivors and their friends and family to engage in tough depositions and years of appeals, exacerbating survivors\u2019 \u201cemotional and psychological pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cA lot of survivors are ready for this to be resolved,\u201d said Kristi Schubert, an attorney representing dozens of survivors. \u201cA lot of them would prefer to receive certain money now.\u201d",

He pointed out that the bankruptcy process allows the church to \u201cwear people down\u201d and keep the public in the dark about the extent to which it enabled abuse.",
      "The settlement as outlined in May requires the archdiocese to bring in outside experts to evaluate its child-protection programs and recommend improvements. The archdiocese would also establish a document archive at a secular university related to its abuse and hold public forums for survivors to share their experiences and concerns with the archbishop.",
      "\u201cI remain very hopeful and committed to bringing this bankruptcy to a conclusion that benefits the survivors of abuse,\u201d said New Orleans Archbishop Gregory M. Aymond in a Monday statement. \u201cPlease know that I pray for the survivors of abuse every day and look forward to the opportunity to meet with them to hear their stories...\u201d",

      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",

      "Armani told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2006 that it was a response to the emerging feminist movement; he thought women needed their own sexy version of boardroom attire. \"When I started blending men and women's fashions many years ago, the public often became uneasy and perplexed,\" he said.",

But a small gymnasium in Nashville \u2013 the home of the Donelson Christian Academy Wildcats \u2013 is where he's recently made his mark. He's donated more than a million dollars to his alma matter, which now features the Nate Bargatze Gymnasium.",
      "Bargatze never played on this court: \"Yeah, I was cut every year from my basketball team,\" he said. \"But now, you know, now they can't cut you!\"",
      "Donelson Christian Academy is a private high school his family could only afford because his father taught here. \"My freshman year, he's assistant coach,\" Bargatze said. \"So that really got it started. When your dad cuts you, it kind of sets the tone for the rest of your high school.\"",
      "Nate's father, Stephen Bargatze, also happens to be a professional magician. Before that, he was a clown. As you might imagine, that provided some inspiration for a career in comedy \u2013 and for some early stand-up material:",
      "\"It's funny, too, when I tell people my dad was a clown. People will just be like 'Ugh, I hate clowns.' Hey, remember that time I just said my dad was a clown?\"",
      "After dropping out of community college, Bargatze moved from Nashville to Chicago, where he honed his style performing for free at small clubs. \"I would never trade it, and I would never go back,\" he said. \"You just didn't know no better. There's nothing better than when you don't know that there's better.\"",
      "He then made the move to New York. But in 2014, just as his stand-up career was taking off, Bargatze made a surprising move back home to Nashville.",
      "Why? \"You know what? I always thought it was the first thing I did that wasn't for me,\" he said. \"I wanted my daughter to grow up in a normal situation, as normal as it can be. And so it was like, 'All right, let's move back.' And when I moved back, I just didn't tell anybody.\"",
      "I asked, \"Were you worried that there was going to be an impression that, like, 'Well, he moved back to Nashville, he's given up'?\"",
      "\"That's why I didn't tell anybody, 'cause I thought they would think I'd quit,\" Bargatze said. \"And I was so scared of that. So, I just didn't say anything.\"",
      "Nobody would ever think that now. Bargatze has since released five hour-long specials, written a New York Times bestselling book, and sold more than a million tickets last year alone.",
      "\"I don't know anything about history. And I can tell, because every history movie I watch, I watch on the edge of my seat. I watched 'Pearl Harbor,' I was as surprised as they were.\"",
      "His next milestone? Hosting the Primetime Emmy Awards next Sunday on CBS.",

You're just curious to go, like, Well, what is that like? What is that, you know, when you do 'Saturday Night Live'?\u00a0It's like, I want to see the chaos. I want to feel the chaos.\"",
      "Bargatze has hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" twice. [\"I'm as shocked as you are that I'm here,\" he said in his monologue.] His \"Washington's Dream\" sketch became one of the most viral sketches in years:",
      "There's more acting on the horizon. Bargatze just finished filming his first feature, \"The Breadwinner,\" costarring Mandy Moore, set to hit theaters next spring. His character is a bumbling dad \u2013 a role he says is not too dissimilar from his real-life personality. \"We eased into it,\" he said, \"I ain't crying in this movie, I can tell you that. In the movie, I have three daughters and, you know, I have one daughter.\"",
      "\"Oh my gosh, give him the Academy Award right now,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. Yeah,\" he laughed. \"There's a lot of buzz about it!\"",
      "Bargatze met his wife, Laura, when he was 21; they were coworkers at an Applebee's. As he recounted in the 2017 special \"The Standups,\" \"I went from, like, my mom to her. So, I don't even know what it feels like not to have some lady be like, 'I don't know if I would do that, you know?'\"",
      "Their daughter, Harper, introduces his stand-up specials, which are intentionally family-friendly. He's a clean comic.",
      "\"I love that people when they come to my show, it's, uh, I don't wanna betray that trust,\" he said. \"You can have your kid watch my stand-up and you don't like, if you see 'em have it on, you don't have to be like, 'Whoa, what's going on?'\"",
      "While working clean can be a savvy business decision, it allows one to sell tickets to the widest audience possible. For Bargatze, it's also part of a larger mission. He said, \"You feel like you're being asked to do this and the career that I have. And so, you just gotta trust that, uh, your path is gonna be the path, and just stick with it.\"",
      "I said, \"When you say asked to do this, do you mean in like sort of a religious calling kind of a way?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied. \"You feel \u2013 you know, I feel it's beyond me.\"",
      "With \"Good Clean Funny\" as its mantra, Bargatze's company, Nateland, produces specials, live events, and podcasts featuring other clean comedians. He even has dreams of one day opening his own theme park and movie studio in Nashville.",
      "\"I'm not gonna be able to go to every city in America for the rest of my life,\" he said. \"So, I want to build a place where you can come. And if you and your wife and your kids are 11 and they want to go run off on their own for a second, I want that to happen.\"",
      "To pull off all of his ambitious plans, one of the most successful touring comedians of all time is already plotting the end of his touring days.",
      "\"I'm doing this tour, I plan on doing one more tour after that,\" he said. \"I need to go do movies, and I need to build that world up and learn how to do all of that stuff. So, I'm gonna dive into that aspect of it. I can see myself being and making movies for, like, another 15 years, and then \u2013 if I'm allowed to! I mean, it might all fall apart.\"",
      "These days, during breaks on his grueling tour schedule, Bargatze is able to briefly take his mind off stand-up by playing golf. \"I mean, it's kind of like stand-up,\" he said. \"You're kind of out there on your own.

    "summary": "Four physicians, who recently resigned from the CDC in protest, tell \"Sunday Morning\" they believe HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is jeopardizing the nation's public health.",
    "story": [
      "At the end of summer, Congress is often sleepy, and slowly gets back to work. But this past week was an exception. On Capitol Hill, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrived, and the controversial Health and Human Services Secretary sparked a reckoning over public health in America.",
      "At a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday, Kennedy defended the Trump administration's policies: \"We at HHS are enacting a once-in-a-generation shift from a sick-care system, to a true health care system that tackles the root causes of chronic disease,\" he said.",
      "Tempers ran hot at the hearing. Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) said, \"This is not a podcast. It is the American people's health that is on the line here.\"",
      "Democrats rebuked Kennedy, perhaps the most high-profile member of President Donald Trump's cabinet. Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.) asked Kennedy, \"When were you lying, sir \u2013   when you told this committee that you were not anti-vax? Or when you told Americans that there's no safe and effective vaccine?\"",
      "To which Kennedy replied, \"Both things are true.\"",
      "There were Republicans who offered broad support for Kennedy. Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Ida.) said, \"President Trump and Secretary Kennedy have made a steadfast commitment to make America healthy again.\"",
      "Yet some Republicans notably did push Kennedy on how his long-standing opposition to vaccine mandates is affecting policy, and on Kennedy's doubts about the safety of various vaccines. Sen. John Barasso (R-Wyo.) said, \"There are real concerns that safe, proven vaccines like measles, like hepatitis B and others, could be in jeopardy.\"",
      "The committee room standoff had been brewing for days. On Aug. 27, the government announced new restrictions on eligibility for COVID vaccinations. That decision prompted some health organizations to warn the policy could cause confusion.",
      "That same day, the Trump White House said Susan Monarez, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who had just been confirmed by the Senate weeks earlier, was fired.",
      "The Trump White House stood by Secretary Kennedy's sweeping changes, and by the firing. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said of Monarez, \"She was not aligned with President Trump's mission to make America healthy again.\"",
      "In a statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said, \"The White House maintains full confidence in Secretary Kennedy's leadership at HHS to advance President Trump's MAHA agenda. With Operation Warp Speed's unprecedented success delivering COVID-19 vaccines in record time, President Trump proved that it's possible to shake up the status quo of our broken and bureaucratic public health system to deliver real results for the American people. Now the second Trump administration is building on this record and experience to restore Gold Standard Science as the guiding principle of health decision-making at HHS to Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Susan Monarez has written that she was pressured to \"compromise science itself\" \u2013 and to sign off on people who \"have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric.\"",
      "This turbulence has put Kennedy, who was a key Trump ally during last year's campaign, in the spotlight.",
      "Asked whether there has been pressure within the Republican Party to stand by Kennedy, Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul said, \"Nobody's pressured me or ever called me on it. I sort of speak my mind. And these are long-standing beliefs for me.\"",
      "Paul, an ophthalmologist, supports Kennedy, and lays blame on scientists \u2014 not skeptics \u2014 for worries about vaccine safety. \"All the doubt over vaccines is \u2013 there might be some doubt coming from those who don't want you to take a vaccine, but quite a bit of doubt is coming from the establishment that I believe is authoritarian in nature,\" said Paul. \"You don't care whether they tell you what to do. You should just do what you're told. We know better than you.\"",
      "But some who have worked at the highest level are fighting back against criticism, and are sounding an alarm.",
      "\"A significant distrust of vaccines\"",
      "Four CDC officials \u2014 Doctors Jennifer Layden, Daniel Jernigan, Debra Houry, and Demetre Daskalakis \u2014 all have resigned in recent days, some citing Secretary Kennedy's vaccine policies, others citing the upheaval at the CDC, which provides crucial health guidance nationwide.",
      "And all four expressed concerns about their resulting trust in CDC information about vaccines and vaccine safety data. \"It's why I left; I'm very concerned,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We've already crossed the line. The COVID recommendations for children and pregnant women are completely not based in any evidence that world experts agree on.\"",
      "I asked, \"You know Secretary Kennedy would push back on that; what would you tell him?\"",
      "\"Ah, easy,\" Daskalakis replied. \"The recommendation is that there should be no healthy kids that get the vaccine; it should only be in kids with underlying conditions. Kids that are six-months-old, 56% of them that are admitted to the hospital have no underlying condition. So, by not offering the vaccine to parents who are willing to do it, those kids that could have been protected won't be.\"",
      "Asked how he would label Kennedy and his view of vaccines, Dr. Daniel Jernigan said, \"I think he has a significant distrust of vaccines. I don't know that he's driving a get-rid-of-vaccines agenda. It's more death by a thousand cuts, death by a thousand questions, calling into question data that has been accepted for many, many years, and simply that calling it into question brings into people's minds that, 'Maybe I shouldn't get that vaccine.'\"",
      "Dr. Debra Houry said that when Kennedy began at HHS, \"I read his books. I wanted to better understand his research and his background on it. So, we were open, you know, to having those discussions.\"",
      "In an additional statement to \"Sunday Morning,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said:",
      "\"Americans haven't forgotten how 'the science' was politicized and weaponized during the COVID era by unaccountable 'health officials' to push intrusive mandates and stifle any semblance of the skepticism that actual scientific inquiry is based on. The Trump administration is committed to restoring evidence-based, Gold Standard Science and answering the questions that Americans haven't been allowed to ask to restore trust, confidence, and accountability in our public health bodies.\"",
      "Asked what the cost to Americans would be of doctors and other officials leaving the CDC, Dr. Jennifer Layden said, \"We're talking about the whole public health infrastructure of our nation. And I think when we start to see (and we will) outbreaks that normally don't happen \u2013 more food-borne outbreaks, Legionella outbreaks, rising measles cases \u2013 people will start to care. That may take time for us to see some of those negative consequences, but that's what the ripple effect of all this will do across our nation.\"",
      "In fact, ripple effects are already apparent.",
      "\"Diseases don't obey borders\"",
      "Just this past week, Florida's Republican governor announced plans to eliminate all childhood vaccine requirements.",
      "Meanwhile, West Coast Democratic governors who oppose Secretary Kennedy's policies are moving fast to protect vaccine programs in their states.",
      "I asked Dr. Atul Gawande, a surgeon who served in the Biden administration, \"What is the consequence for the country when you have such a differentiation? It's splintered.\"",
      "\"It's severely splintered, and I'm very worried about it,\" Gawandea replied, \"because diseases don't obey borders.",
      "For Gawande, Kennedy's actions could upend not only federal agencies, but America's standing in global health. \"There isn't always consensus, for sure, among our own medical community,\" he said, \"but we generally have been able to come together enough to be able to say, 'Here is where we can assure getting \u2013 whether it's COVID boosters, and making sure we don't leave out the people who are most in need of vaccination \u2013 to making sure we're not abandoning our childhood immunization. Other countries around the world are baffled by our now falling into a civil war over whether the discoveries that have saved the world mattered.\"",
      "Later this month, the CDC's vaccine advisory board \u2014\u00a0now featuring Kennedy appointees\u00a0\u2014 will meet to decide future guidelines.",
      "At the end of the day, Gawande says, \"Trust helps assuage doubt.\"",
      "But, I asked, \"Is trust still possible in this environment?\"",
      "\"Trust is still possible,\" said Gawande, \"but it is not possible while we have leaders who actively drive chaos, who actively are trying to create uncertainty and break down trust. But ultimately, people have to choose the leaders who have the track record of demonstrating better outcomes. And those leaders are scientists, health professionals, and others who have demonstrated over years that they actually get you better results.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Sep 2025 19:16:26 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "The inquiry comes after OpenAI said it plans to make changes to ChatGPT safeguards for vulnerable people, including adding extra protections for those under 18 years old, after the parents of a teen boy who died by suicide in April sued, alleging the artificial intelligence chatbot led their teen to take his own life.",
      "More children are now using AI chatbots for everything \u2014 from homework help to personal advice, emotional support and everyday decision-making.

      "In an email to CBS News, Snap said, \"We share the FTC's focus on ensuring the thoughtful development of generative AI, and look forward to working with the Commission on AI policy that bolsters U.S. innovation while protecting our community.\"",

      "Parents can choose which features to disable and \"receive notifications when the system detects their teen is in a moment of acute distress,\" according to a company blog post that says the changes will go into effect this fall.",
      "Regardless of a user's age, the company says its chatbots will attempt to redirect the most distressing conversations to more capable AI models that can provide a better response.",
      "Meta also said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",

      "According to the group, a 2.7% COLA would raise the average monthly benefit for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062. The Senior Citizens League predicted the same cost-of-living adjustment in August.",
      "The cost-of-living adjustment has averaged 2.6% over the last 20 years, according to the Senior Citizens League. A COLA of 2.7% would be higher than this year's adjustment of 2.5%, but below the 3.2% boost seniors received in 2024.",
      "The Social Security Administration (SSA) makes a cost-of-living adjustment each year based on inflation data from July, August and September. Thursday's CPI report shows that the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the figure the SSA uses to make its annual adjustment, increased 2.8% on an annual basis in August, up from 2.5% the month prior.",
      "The SSA is scheduled to announce its adjustment in October, which would go into effect in January 2026. \"This year, the COLA will be determined on October 15, when the Bureau of Labor and Statistics releases the CPI-W for September,\" the agency told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The flight, which departed Atlanta, is expected to land in South Korea on Friday afternoon, according to The Associated Press.",
      "The South Korean workers were among some 475 people detained on Sept. 4 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents at a still-under construction joint Hyundai-LG electric vehicle battery facility near Savannah. ICE said they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News photographer Darrall Johnson watched as the Koreans boarded eight buses that then left for the airport, where a Korean Air charter flight was waiting to fly them home. Johnson said a cart full of documents was loaded onto one of the buses.",
      "South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, in an address delivered Thursday in Seoul, said 316 South Koreans would be on the flight, including 10 women. He said one South Korean had decided to remain in the U.S. as they have family members in the country.   The Foreign Ministry said there were also 14 non-Korean nationals boarding the plane, three Japanese, 10 Chinese and one Indonesian.",
      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",
      "The detention of hundreds of South Koreans in an ICE facility tested U.S.-South Korea ties that are important politically, militarily and economically. South Korea is the biggest foreign direct investor in the U.S. and the sixth biggest trading partner overall.",

But everyone who I speak to, they view America as its number-one partner here from South Korea. Yes, we're going to have some challenging times.\"",

      "\"Are we giving our money, technology, and investment to the United States only to be treated like this?,\" Kim asked.",
      "Cho replied by saying he would try to negotiate with Rubio to increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled Korean nationals to work in specialty occupations in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the ICE raid was the biggest single-site enforcement action in the agency's history. ICE alleges that the South Korean workers either overstayed their visa waiver permits, known as ESTAs, which allow business visits of up to 90 days, or were holding visas that did not permit them to perform manual labor, called B-1 business visas.",
      "Kim, at the American Chamber in Seoul, called it a \"blip\" in U.S.-Korea ties and said he was \"very, very optimistic about a much brighter future between the two\" countries.",
      "South Korea's president, however, took a more critical tone.",
      "\"As the president who is in charge of national safety, I feel a great responsibility,\" Lee said Tuesday. \"I hope that the unfair infringement of our people and corporate activities for the joint development of both Korea and the United States will not happen again.\"",
      "A poll conducted in South Korea found that almost 60% of respondents said they were disappointed by the U.S. crackdown and called the measures \"excessive,\" while about 31% said the ICE action was \"inevitable\" and that they could understand the reasoning.",

      "\"My key message is listen to what President Trump said today. He wants to encourage more foreign companies to invest in America. Bring your people, bring your resources into America, but do it legally,\" he told CBS News.",
      "\"An opportunity to really fix some things\" with a key U.S. ally",
      "Industry experts caution, however, that it may be difficult to maintain investment levels under those guidelines, as securing visas can take years, while many projects face strict deadlines and delays can drive up costs. There is a shortage of highly skilled workers in the U.S., meanwhile, for battery manufacturing, semiconductor and modern shipbuilding industries \u2014 all arenas in which South Korea has been investing heavily for years.",
      "Such jobs can require years of experience, not just a few months of on-the-job training.",
      "A spokesperson for South Korea's Foreign Ministry told CBS News that since Mr. Trump's second term began, it had already reached out 52 times on the matter of securing more visas for highly-skilled workers.",
      "Kim, the U.S. chamber of commerce leader, said the current upset in relations represented \"an opportunity to really fix some things that could be in the grey area, make it a lot more clear, so that they can have an even better relationship.\"",
      "He said that, given Seoul's importance as an investor in the U.S., it may be a good time for Washington to consider adopting a new policy that allows South Koreans to more easily come and work in the U.S.",
      "\"I think that in the past, Korea may not have been a significant investor in the United States, but now they are,\" he said. \"So I think it's worthy and deserving of that kind of a new status.\"",
      "Mr. Trump gave a nod in his Truth Social post to the notion that the U.S. does need foreign expertise, saying foreign companies should bring people over to help train American workers \u2014 and then hire them to do the work themselves.",

      "Rubio and Cho discussed advancing U.S.-South Korean ties \"through a forward-looking agenda\" that \"revitalizes American manufacturing through ROK investment in shipbuilding and other strategic sectors, and promotes a fair and reciprocal trade partnership,\" the State Department said.",
      "According to South Korea's Foreign Ministry, \"Cho expressed deep concern over the public disclosure of the detention of Korean workers who came to the United States to share technology and know-how and contribute to the Trump administration's efforts to revitalize American manufacturing, which has deeply hurt and shocked all Koreans.\"",
      "The ministry's statement said Cho had \"strongly requested the U.S. administration's special attention and support to ensure that these workers, who are not criminals, can quickly depart the US without physical restraint, such as handcuffs, and that they will not face any disadvantages in future visits to the U.S. He also proposed the establishment of a working group between the U.S. and South Korea to discuss various measures, including the creation of new visa categories, to prevent similar incidents from recurring.\"",

      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting.

It takes an average of 30 days between when you start planning a trip and when it's fully finished,\" Skylar Erickson, co-founder of Gondola AI, which helps consumers maximize their loyalty points, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You have 40 tabs open on your browser, so it takes a lot of work to get to that right answer.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Labor's internal watchdog is launching a review of the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) approach to collecting and reporting economic data.",
      "Laura Nicolosi, assistant inspector general for audit in the Labor Department's Office of Inspector General, said in a September 10 letter to acting BLS commissioner William Wiatrowski that the watchdog will examine how the statistics bureau compiles and reports monthly inflation and jobs data.",
      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",
      "\"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.

    "story": [
      "For Kasey McBlais, a 42-year-old single mom who lives in Maine with her two elementary school-aged children, the cost of running a household is only getting more expensive, from buying groceries to paying for her home's upkeep.",
      "\"It's really challenging,\" McBlais, who works at a nonprofit, says of managing her expenses. \"It's paycheck to paycheck.\"",
      "Cleaning her chimney cost $500 this year, up from about $200 when she bought her house in 2019. And grocery money isn't going as far either, prompting McBlais to stretch meals to make sure the family has leftovers. \"I honestly don't expect anything to go back to the way they were \u2014 it's a matter of things leveling off where they are at,\" she said.",
      "McBlais' concerns and struggles come as the pace of inflation continues to creep higher, remaining well above the Federal Reserve's goal of driving it down to an annual 2% rate. The situation is leaving some consumers feeling frustrated by stubbornly high prices on everything from groceries to housing,\u00a0souring their views\u00a0about the health of the U.S. economy.",
      "In a recent\u00a0CBS News poll, two-thirds of Americans said that prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise, with nearly all saying they expect the rise in costs to continue.",
      "On Thursday, the Consumer Price Index is expected to show that prices rose at an annualized rate of 2.9% in August, up from 2.7% in July. Some economists point to the Trump administration's tariffs as a contributing factor.",
      "\"Tariffs will raise prices, and that does of course lead to inflation \u2014 there's no way around that,\" said Erasmus Kersting, an economics professor at the Villanova School of Business.",
      "To be sure, inflation is well below its pandemic peak. But the Federal Reserve's progress has been slipping, with recent CPI data showing price growth picking up again after reaching a low point this spring.",
      "At the same time, President Trump is pushing the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate, posting on social media on Wednesday that there is \"no inflation!!!\" He also urged the Fed to \"lower the RATE, BIG, right now.\"",
      "In July 2024, when Mr. Trump pledged to end the \"inflation nightmare,\" the CPI rate stood at 2.9%, or the same pace that economists forecast for tomorrow's report.",
      "\"The president would like people to stop paying attention to inflation now because it's not helping it,\" Kersting noted. \"In the past he wanted people to pay attention to it, because back then it did help him win the election.\"",
      "Asked for comment on forecasts the CPI will show an uptick in inflation, the White House said the president is delivering on his promises.",
      "\"Joe Biden unleashed the worst inflation crisis in nearly four years \u2014 President Trump ended it. Despite the media's false narrative, core inflation has run at a 2.4% average pace since President Trump took office which is the lowest 6-month pace since March 2021. The so-called 'experts' have been wrong month after month: tariffs have not hiked prices and President Trump is delivering on his promise to make America affordable again,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve's complicated decision",
      "A hotter CPI report would complicate the Federal Reserve's task of deciding its next interest rate move on Sept. 17, given that the labor market has stalled out this summer. The Fed's so-called \"dual mandate\" requires it to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "So far in 2025, the Fed has held its benchmark rate steady, with Chair Jerome Powell saying he wanted to keep the central bank's powder dry in case tariffs caused inflation to reignite. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "But two consecutive disappointing jobs reports signal that the labor market is stalling out, putting pressure on the Fed to cut rates, which can help bolster hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow and add more workers. Powell last month signaled the Fed may be open to a cut, pointing to the labor market's risks.",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut is pegged at 90% by CME FedWatch, which bases its forecast on 30-day Fed Funds futures prices. There's a slimmer 10% likelihood that the Fed could usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, its data shows.",
      "A rate cut could help some consumers by lowering their borrowing costs, with interest fees on credit cards, home equity lines of credit and other loans likely to drop after a reduction. But households are still continuing to face higher prices at the grocery store and for household bills, experts note.",
      "\"Budget pressure has never fully let up for many households, even as inflation subsided during 2024 and early 2025,\" Stephen Kates, a certified financial planner and Bankrate financial analyst, said in an email. \"Current and future inflation expectations feel like a slow, painful walk down memory lane.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has said he is firing Cook from her role over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago.",
    "story": [
      "A federal Judge on Tuesday ruled that\u00a0Lisa Cook can remain in her role on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors while her lawsuit challenging President Trump's attempt to fire her from her post plays out.",
      "\"President Trump has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal,\" U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, wrote in her ruling, which is likely to be appealed.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is firing Cook over allegations she made false representations on mortgage agreements several years ago, resulting in more favorable loan terms.",
      "\"President Trump's stated cause refers only to allegations regarding Cook's conduct before she began serving on the Federal Reserve Board,\" Cobb wrote. \"As discussed above, such allegations are not a legally permissible cause.\"",
      "In addition to casting doubt on whether Mr. Trump established cause for Cook's firing, in issuing the stay, Cobb also ruled that Cook's right to due process was violated and that she would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction was not granted.",
      "Abbe David Lowell, an attorney representing Cook in her lawsuit, said in a statement to CBS News on Tuesday night, \"This ruling recognizes and reaffirms the importance of safeguarding the independence of the Federal Reserve from illegal political interference. Allowing the President to unlawfully remove Governor Cook on unsubstantiated and vague allegations would endanger the stability of our financial system and undermine the rule of law. Governor Cook will continue to carry out her sworn duties as a Senate-confirmed Board Governor.\"",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement that Tuesday's ruling \"will not be the last say on the matter.\"",
      "\"President Trump lawfully removed Lisa Cook for cause due to credible allegations of mortgage fraud from her highly sensitive position overseeing financial institutions on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors,\" Desai said.",
      "Under federal law, Fed board members\u00a0serve for 14-year terms\u00a0and can only be fired by the president \"for cause.\" Cook has served on the Fed since being appointed to complete another member's unexpired term in 2022, and her current term would run until 2038.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook on Aug. 26, writing in a letter\u00a0terminating her\u00a0from the Fed Board of Governors that he had \"sufficient cause\" to remove her from the position. The president cited a previous letter from Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, that was sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi alleging Cook made false statements on mortgage agreements.",
      "Pulte, an appointee of Mr. Trump's, alleged that Cook in 2021 claimed two different properties in Michigan and Georgia as her primary residence on mortgage documents to get better lending terms. Cook has not been charged with any civil or criminal offense.",
      "Cook's lawyers have previously said in court filings that Mr. Trump's \"unsubstantiated allegation that Governor Cook 'may have' or 'seems' to have erred in filling out a mortgage form in her capacity as a private citizen-does not amount to 'cause' for removal within the meaning of the FRA [Federal Reserve Act].\"",
      "\"None of the alleged misconduct occurred during the performance of Governor Cook's duties as a Federal Board member,\" they wrote. \"And the President and Director Pulte have not even alleged explicitly that Ms. Cook benefited from any clerical error, or that such an error was intentional.\"",
      "In court arguments Friday, Lowell said Cook was not given notice of the allegations or a chance to respond to them, violating, he argued, her due process rights.",
      "Cook's lawsuit argues that Mr. Trump's attempt to oust her is \"unprecedented and illegal,\" noting it would be the first removal of a governor by the president in the Fed's 112-year history.",
      "\"The President's effort to terminate a Senate-confirmed Federal Reserve Board member is a broadside attack on the century-old independence of the Federal Reserve System,\" Cook's lawyers wrote in a filing.",
      "They warned that Mr. Trump's theory of \"cause\" would allow him to remove any Fed Board member with whom he disagrees on policy, eroding the central bank's independence and threatening its mission of providing economic stability.",
      "Cobb appeared to agree with their argument, writing in her ruling on Tuesday, \"Taken to its logical conclusion, the Government's argument leads to an absurd result: While admitting that the President cannot remove an official for policy disagreements, the Government claims that under Reagan, a removal on the grounds of a policy disagreement would nevertheless be unreviewable. ... This cannot be the case. Such a rule would provide no practical insulation for the members of the Board of Governors. It would mean that the President could, in practice, 'remove a member ... merely because he wanted his own appointees.'\"",
      "Cobb also wrote that Mr. Trump \"does not address her [Cook's] in-office conduct at all, let alone provide any examples of how Cook's performance or personal conduct since assuming the role has been in any way deficient in carrying out her statutory duties,\" adding that Mr. Trump's termination letter \"does not identify any conduct that Cook has engaged in while serving as a member of the Board that indicates that Cook lacks the competence or trustworthiness for the role.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move to fire Cook came amid his repeated\u00a0attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, over the central bank's handling of interest rates.",
      "Cook, Powell and 10 other Fed officials sit on a committee that controls the nation's monetary policy and sets target interest rates, with a dual mandate of keeping inflation low and employment levels high. This work is typically done independently, with little to no input from political leaders.",
      "While the Fed did cut interest rates last year, after they had reached their highest point in decades in 2022 and 2023 in a bid to fight off inflation, the central bank has recently kept rates at relatively high levels. Powell has cited concerns that lowering rates could again lead to a swift rise in inflation and that Mr. Trump's tariffs could also lead to an increase in consumer prices.",

      "\"ATM fees are just one of those avenues that the bank can very freely continue to charge fees,\" Bankrate financial analyst Stephen Kates told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those costs include charges from both ATM owners and banks. According to the survey, the average fee from cash machine providers is $3.22. Banks charge $1.64 on average, up 3.8% from 2024 \u2014 the highest since 2018. As a result, Americans in certain metro areas could see average combined fees of more than $5.",
      "For its survey, Bankrate polled a total of 10 banks and financial institutions in 25 of the nation's largest metro areas. Atlanta topped the list for highest ATM costs, with an average out-of-network fee of $5.37. Behind Atlanta are Phoenix and San Diego, where ATM charges average $5.35 and $5.31, respectively.",
      "Boston and Seattle had the lowest average rates among the metro areas surveyed \u2014 $4.37 and $4.42, respectively.",
      "What's behind the rising charges?",
      "The problem, said Kates, is that while there have been regulatory rumblings around curbing overdraft fees, resulting in voluntary caps by financial institutions, there are no limits on how much banks can charge for ATM withdrawals, giving them free rein to hike fees as much as they want. And since the charges apply to people outside the bank's network, there's no risk of it losing customers.",
      "\"It's one of the ways for the bank to certainly make money, and it's one of the ways to do so that doesn't really hurt their own customers,\" Kates said.",
      "Higher fees also help ATM owners and banks make up for lost revenue as consumers gravitate away from using cash and toward digital payments, said Kates. Also, online banking has nearly eliminated the need for automated bank tellers. According to a\u00a0survey\u00a0conducted by Morning Consult on behalf of the American Bankers Association last year, only 5% of customers relied on ATMs to manage their bank accounts.",
      "To be sure, reliance on cash hasn't disappeared altogether. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that cash was still Americans' primary form of payment as of October 2024 \u2014 whether for a trip to an old-school laundromat or a vexingly cash-only restaurant.",
      "\"Fewer and fewer people need to use cash for certain things, but there are some times when you have to have it,\" said Kates.",
      "How to avoid high ATM fees",
      "Avoiding high ATM fees requires a bit of strategy and forethought, as you may not always be near a bank-affiliated ATM when you need to withdraw cash.",
      "In such a situation, one option is to get cash back at a local store. Kates also encourages people to look at their banking app to see which ATMs are close to them.",
      "If you need to withdraw cash on a regular basis, but live in an area where there aren't any ATMs in-network, you may want to consider changing where you bank to accommodate your needs. Certain online financial services like Fidelity, for instance, reimburse customers for ATM fees \u2014 making them a more attractive option.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday said it will decide whether President Trump can impose his most sweeping tariffs, setting up a major test of one of the pillars of the president's economic agenda.",
      "The high court agreed to review lower court decisions\u00a0that found Mr. Trump did not have the authority to issue many of his global tariffs under an emergency powers law. The Justice Department appealed one of those rulings, from a federal appeals court, to the Supreme Court last week and asked it to move swiftly.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that upholding the ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit would put the United States at a disadvantage and expose the nation to retaliatory trade policies.",
      "The case is the first in which the Supreme Court will directly decide the legality of one of Mr. Trump's second-term policies. The high court has been asked roughly two dozen times to intervene in challenges to many of the president's initiatives, but on an interim emergency basis.",
      "The justices said arguments in the tariffs case would take place in the first week of November.",
      "The tariffs case",
      "One of the disputes before the Supreme Court was brought by a group of small businesses and 12 states. They argued that he did not have the authority to impose many of the global tariffs under the emergency powers law that he invoked, called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.",
      "A federal trade court ruled in May that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he issued the tariffs under IEEPA, and the Federal Circuit upheld that decision late last month. In its 7-4 decision, the appeals court agreed that the tariffs are illegal.",
      "\"It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The statute neither mentions tariffs (or any of its synonyms) nor has procedural safeguards that contain clear limits on the President's power to impose tariffs.\"",
      "The appeals court did not decide whether IEEPA authorizes any tariffs at all. Instead, it only resolved whether sweeping duties that Mr. Trump imposed through a series of executive orders earlier this year are allowed under the law.",
      "The second case involves a pair of Illinois-based companies that sell educational toys and products. A federal district judge in Washington, D.C., ruled in May that IEEPA \"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders. The decision from U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras was more narrow, barring the Trump administration only from collecting any tariff from the two companies. Contreras paused his decision while the Justice Department appealed to the D.C. Circuit.",
      "The two companies asked the Supreme Court in June to fast track the case and leap frog the appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "A spokesperson for one of the companies, Learning Resources, said in a statement it was \"gratified\" that the Supreme Court would hear the case.",
      "\"There is a lot riding on this historic case,\" the spokesperson said. \"The unlawful IEEPA tariffs have wreaked havoc in our economy for too long now.\"",
      "The duties at issue include those announced by Mr. Trump in early April \u2014 which he refers to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 that set a 10% baseline rate for nearly every country, and higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners. It also involves a set of levies on imports from Canada, Mexico and China in response to what Mr. Trump said is their failure to address the trafficking of fentanyl across U.S. borders.",
      "The president has used the tariffs, and the threat of additional duties, to try to force trading partners to negotiate trade deals with his administration. So far, \u00a0he has announced frameworks of trade agreements with the European Union and six countries: the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.",
      "Mr. Trump is the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, though it has been used by his predecessors to hit foreign nations with economic sanctions. His administration has argued that a denial of tariff authority would put the U.S. on the brink of \"economic catastrophe\" and make the nation poorer.",
      "In urging the Supreme Court to move quickly, Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a filing that the Federal Circuit's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President's efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis.\"",
      "The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA gives the president broad powers to regulate trade, including imposing tariffs, \"to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, foreign policy or the economy.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that trade deficits and the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. constituted threats to the national security and economy of the U.S., and invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs to address them.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs have remained in effect, since the Federal Circuit put its decision on hold until Oct. 14 to give the administration time to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "The plaintiffs \u2014 the five small businesses and 12 states \u2014 agreed that the Supreme Court needs to resolve the legality of Mr. Trump's tariffs, calling it an issue of \"great\" and \"undoubted importance.\" They argued that the tariffs are illegal and urged the high court to affirm the Federal Circuit's decision.",
      "\"The government's case rests entirely on the notion that the phrase 'regulate \u2026 importation' in IEEPA constitutes a boundless power to impose tariffs on the American people whenever the President wants, at whatever level he wants, for whatever countries and products he wants, and for as long as he wants, merely by declaring that longstanding U.S. trade deficits are a national 'emergency' and an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' \u2014 assertions the government claims are effectively unreviewable,\" lawyers for the small businesses wrote in a Supreme Court filing. \"There are no limits.\"",
      "The states, meanwhile, said that the Constitution gives Congress the power to collect taxes, and the Trump administration is claiming that the president has sweeping authority to impose tariffs \"on any country, at any rate, and for however long he likes.\"",
      "\"The President's chaotic implementation of that purported authority, which changed by the day and wreaked havoc on capital markets and the economy, illustrates both the breadth of powers that the President claims and the danger of unlimited authority in this domain,\" they warned in court papers.",
      "The legal challenge to Mr. Trump's tariffs is likely to be one of several involving the president's second-term policies that the Supreme Court takes up. Other cases involving his immigration policies and efforts to remove members of independent agencies have progressed through the lower courts, and the Trump administration is likely to seek Supreme Court review of decisions against it.",

    "summary": "The downward revision from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job market was slowing in 2024 and early 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. labor market added 911,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period that ended March 2025 than had earlier been reported, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. The major downward revision signals that the labor market was slowing more last year than had earlier been reported.",
      "The so-called preliminary benchmark revision, produced annually by the BLS, was bigger than a decline of roughly 800,000 that economists had forecast prior to the release. The revision aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed in the 12-month period it covers, as these changes are sometimes missed by the BLS' monthly jobs report.",
      "The downward revision comes as the labor market appears to be ailing, with Friday's\u00a0disappointing August jobs report\u00a0sending warning signals about the pace of hiring across the U.S. At the same time, the BLS is in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, with the president last month\u00a0questioning the validity\u00a0of the monthly jobs report after the data included a significant downward revision, prompting him to\u00a0fire the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS.",
      "Revisions are a normal part of the statistical process at the BLS, economists note. That's because the monthly jobs data is based on a survey of businesses, and some companies respond after the agency's initial jobs report has been issued. Because of that, the BLS updates its data to reflect the new information.",
      "The sharp downward annual revision signals that the job market was facing bigger headwinds in 2024 and early 2025 than earlier reported, and could add to the Federal Reserve's case for cutting its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting, economists said.",
      "\"Today's data suggests cooling in the labor market is more dramatic than previously thought,\" said Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, in an email.",
      "She added, \"This strengthens the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates next week, as it's additional evidence that the labor market side of the dual mandate needs some attention.\"",
      "Less momentum in job gains",
      "With the new revisions, job growth in 2025 has averaged 44,000 per month, down from 75,000 prior to the revamped numbers, Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. In 2024, payroll gains factoring in the revisions averaged 106,000, down from 168,000 previously.",
      "\"The revision shows the economy entered 2025 with less momentum than previously understood,\" he said. \"It's now a lock that the Fed will cut interest rates at their meeting next week and that further rate cuts will follow in the months ahead. The question is by how much.\"",
      "The probability of a 0.25 percentage point rate cut at the Fed's Sept. 17 meeting is now projected at 94%, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The annual revisions are based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs, or about 11 million workplaces.",
      "The QCEW tracks when businesses open or close, something that is difficult for the monthly jobs report to track. For instance, if a business doesn't respond to the monthly survey, the BLS doesn't immediately know if the company simply isn't responding or if it has shut down.",
      "The large revision is likely due to the QCEW's tracking of businesses that have either been newly created or recently closed, with some of those new companies likely having slower hiring than the BLS had earlier estimated, Pantheon Macroeconomics chief U.S. economist Samuel Tombs said in a research note.",
      "\"Probably about two-thirds of the downward benchmark revision looks set to be due to weaker job creation at new firms than the BLS initially inferred from its model,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" signed into law by President Trump in July provides a bevy of new tax cuts and deductions that could lower taxes for millions of Americans, according to a recent analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "The typical filer could see a tax cut of $3,752 in 2026, the nonpartisan think tank found. But the impact will also vary geographically, with some residents in some states likely receiving a bigger tax benefit than others under the new law, Garrett Watson, director of policy analysis, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For instance, the biggest average cut will go to residents of Wyoming, with a reduction of $5,374, according to his analysis of the law's impact.",
      "The geographic differences are due partly to variations in the average income of each state, given that the law provides bigger tax cuts to high-income Americans\u00a0compared with low-income households, Watson noted. Other provisions also could help some regions more than others. That includes the higher deduction cap for state and local taxes, which will give more of a lift to people in states with high property taxes, such as New Jersey and New York.",
      "\"Places with higher incomes are going to have higher nominal tax cuts,\" Watson said. \"The largest tax benefits are going to the mountain states \u2014 it's due to a subgroup of higher-income business owners.\"",
      "Residents of Mississippi and West Virginia are likely to see the smallest tax cuts next year, the analysis found. Incomes in those states tend to be lower than the national average, with median household income in Mississippi standing at about $55,000 as of 2023 and $60,000 for West Virginians, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The national household median income is about $80,600.",
      "The Tax Foundation analysis projects the average tax cut in tax year 2026, meaning that these numbers reflect the reductions for the next calendar year. Although many of the law's provisions are effective in 2025, the IRS is still working out the details on some of them, which means lower tax withholding for the new provisions won't be fully in place until 2026, Watson said.",
      "Bigger refunds?",
      "Tax refunds are also likely to be larger in early 2026, when people file their taxes for the 2025 calendar year, Watson said, although he hasn't calculated the potential impact.",
      "Seniors who can claim a new $6,000 deduction for people over 65 under the law may get a bigger refund, as well as taxpayers across the board due to the higher standard deduction, said Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.",
      "Because of the tax changes in the new law, Steber recommends that people start preparing now. For example, workers who are newly eligible for tax breaks on tips and on overtime pay should keep track of such income.",
      "\"Having this much time left in the year allows taxpayers to make any necessary adjustments to help increase a refund or lower an amount due, and can be as simple as adjusting the withholding on a W-4,\" Steber told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The top 1% of earners around the U.S. \u2014 those with incomes over $1.1 million \u2014 will receive a $75,410 annual tax break from the new law in 2026, according to a\u00a0separate analysis\u00a0from the Tax Policy Center, nonpartisan think tank. That compares with an average tax break of $150 for households in the bottom 20% of the income distribution, or people earning less than $36,000 a year, and of $1,780 for earning $66,801 to $119,200.",
      "To be sure, many of new law's tax cuts will depend on an individual's financial circumstances. For instance, a low-income worker who earns tips or overtime could see a much bigger tax cut due to the law's \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" provisions, Watson noted.",

    "summary": "Uncertainty over U.S. tariffs and other Trump administration economic policies are deterring manufacturers from hiring, according to the Center for American Progress.",
    "story": [
      "Manufacturers in the U.S. are cutting thousands of jobs even as President Trump pushes economic policies that he says will revitalize the industry.",
      "Employers shed 12,000 manufacturing jobs\u00a0in August, while payrolls in the sector have shrunk by 42,000 since April, according to a new\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center for American Progress (CAP) that draws on government labor data.",
      "The nonpartisan policy institute attributes that decline to the Trump administration's steep new tariffs; hardline stance on immigration; and the Republican-backed \"big, beautiful bill,\" a tax and spending package enacted by Mr. Trump in July that CAP says hurts renewable energy companies by phasing out certain tax credits.",
      "For all of 2025, manufacturing employment in the U.S. has sunk by a total of 33,000 jobs, according to Labor Department\u00a0figures. Most of those job losses have been among companies that make durable goods, such as cars, household appliances and electronics. The drop comes as hiring overall has slowed sharply in recent months, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs in August, well below forecasts.",
      "The number of manufacturing jobs in the U.S. has declined for the past six decades, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. In 1960, manufacturing represented about 34% of total employment, while the number of jobs in the sector peaked in 1970 at 19.5 million. As of August this year, 12.7 million Americans were employed in manufacturing, while the industry lost 87,000 jobs in 2024,\u00a0data shows.",
      "Uncertainty hurting businesses",
      "When Mr. Trump in April announced a range of levies on dozens of other countries, the White House said tariffs would protect American workers by reducing the U.S. trade deficit with its economic partners and spurring employers to move manufacturing jobs to the U.S.",
      "For now, however, confusion over the scale and scope of U.S. tariffs has put manufacturers on the defensive, increasing their costs and discouraging them from hiring, economist Sara Estrep, one of the authors of the CAP report, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Companies are uncertain about what's happening,\" she said. \"Everything has been changing on a day-to-day basis, so it's not clear what production should look like. That's why they aren't hiring.\"",
      "In August, for example, farm equipment giant John Deere cited tariffs in announcing that its sales and operating profits had dipped from a year ago. In an earnings call, an executive with the company noted that it had racked up roughly $300 million in tariff-related costs, including on steel and aluminum imports. John Deere also announced it was laying off more than 200 workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa, according to AgWeb, a trade publication.",
      "Automakers pointed partly to tariffs in announcing nearly 5,000 job cuts in July, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, while it noted that the retail sector has also stepped up layoffs and store closures because of economic uncertainty.",
      "Another factor fueling uncertainty for manufacturers are the ongoing legal challenges to the Trump tariffs, making it hard to plan and invest for the future, according to experts.",
      "A federal appeals court in August ruled that Mr. Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on September 3\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to review the lower court's decision before it takes effect in October.",
      "The outcome of the case leaves many manufacturers in doubt about how to proceed, making them reluctant to expand their workforce as they seek to control costs, Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The slowdown is symptomatic of an environment where purchasing managers are all under stress, and they are being squeezed by higher costs of goods and reduced demand,\" said EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. \"And so in that squeeze, they are having to find ways to offset the higher costs, and one of the avenues to do that is to streamline their operations and make sure that they only have the essential talent on hand.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to several requests for comment on CAP's findings. The Office of the United States Trade Representative and National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Immigration effect",
      "The Trump administration's crackdown on U.S. immigrants is also weighing on hiring in manufacturing, said Daniel Altman, an economist and author of the High Yield Economics newsletter.",
      "\"Immigration has been an important source of employment in manufacturing for some industries, and if you take away some of their labor supply, that's just gives them more incentive to pursue automation and other forms of capital intensive manufacturing,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The government stepped up its campaign last week when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents\u00a0detained 475 immigrants, most of them Korean, at a Hyundai plant in Georgia because they were suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally.",
      "Border patrol agents have also\u00a0conducted raids targeting immigrants working in retail, according to CBS News. In sectors like farming, food processing and construction, undocumented immigrants make up to 20% of the workforce, according to\u00a0Goldman Sachs.",
      "White House \"border czar\" Tom Homan on Sunday said the White House will expand such efforts.",
      "\"We're going to do more worksite enforcement operations,\" Homan told CNN. \"No one hires an illegal alien out of the goodness of their heart. They hire them because they can work them harder, pay them less, undercut the competition that hires U.S. citizen employees.\"",
      "Other long-term factors that go beyond the Trump administration's policies are also contributing to the ongoing contraction in manufacturing jobs. During the pandemic, manufacturers invested heavily in technologies to automate their operations, Altman noted.",
      "\"We've seen a lot of automation, which means companies do not need as many workers to provide the same output,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Output per worker has been increasing, and when we see that kind of increase in labor productivity, it usually means workers have access to more capital, or better technology or both, and that's what you'd expect with automation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jobs-report-revision-september-9-bls-economy-trump/",
    "published": "Tue, 09 Sep 2025 07:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to revise its jobs data downward for the year ended in March 2025. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "The latest jobs report\u00a0points to a labor market that's faltering, but the slowdown may have begun much earlier. Economists expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics to issue a major downward revision today, showing the nation added hundreds of thousands fewer jobs than first reported.",
      "On Sept. 9, the BLS will release its preliminary benchmark revision to labor market data at 10 a.m. ET, which aims to better account for businesses that have opened or closed. Economists say the revision, covering the 12-month period through March 2025, could show that hiring during that time was about 800,000 jobs lower than previously reported.",
      "The report could draw attention from the Trump administration, as the president last month questioned the validity of the monthly jobs report \u2014 and fired the commissioner\u00a0of the BLS \u2014 after the data included a significant downward revision. Hiring experts and economists point to a job market that's stalling out as some businesses are bearing increased tariff costs while others are tapping artificial intelligence as a way to lower labor costs and\u00a0replace workers.",
      "\"The labor market will likely look even worse after the release of the preliminary benchmark revision to payrolls on Sept. 9,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, noted in an email.",
      "The revision could show that employment was reduced by about 775,000 for the 12 months through March, Adams estimated. That would indicate that the average monthly job growth in 2024 actually stood at 100,000 per month, down from the 165,000 previously reported, he added.",
      "The revision would cover only the first three months of Mr. Trump's second administration, with the bulk of the timeframe occurring in the last year of former President Biden's administration.",
      "Job growth has slowed dramatically in recent months, with the employers adding an average of 29,000 jobs each month from June through August, the most recent BLS data shows.",
      "Why does the government revise its jobs data?",
      "Jobs revisions occur each month, with the BLS updating its data to reflect more recent information it has received from businesses about the pace of hiring. That's because some companies respond late to the BLS' surveys, which means the agency receives an influx of new information after it has issued its initial monthly jobs report, prompting the fresh numbers.",
      "But once a year, the BLS also issues an annual revision based on fresh data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which tracks employment and wages reported by employers that cover more than 95% of U.S. jobs.",
      "While the monthly jobs report relies on about 50,000 responses for each period, the QCEW covers 11 million workplaces \u2014 but that scope requires more time for collecting the data versus the BLS' monthly report, Adams of Comerica said.",
      "\"The QCEW's detail lets it directly measure jobs added at newly-opened workplaces and lost at closing ones, which account for several millions of employment churn each year,\" he added.",
      "What happened in the last annual revision?",
      "The BLS issued a\u00a0major downward\u00a0revision last year for the same annual data, showing that employers added 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months ended March 2024 than previously estimated. That lowered the average monthly job growth for the period to 174,000, down from the initial estimate of 242,000.",
      "At the time, the downward revision was seen as evidence that the labor market was showing cracks, and it was viewed as paving the way for the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September 2024 meeting.",
      "What does this mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Fed will be focused on analyzing recent economic data, such as the latest jobs report and the next Consumer Price Index, which will be issued on Sept. 11. Economists expect the CPI to show an annualized increase of 2.9% in August, higher than the prior month's 2.7% and well above the Fed's goal of reaching a 2% annual rate.",
      "With the labor market hitting a wall in recent months, economists now expect the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate at its Sept. 17 meeting. The only question is whether the Fed might usher in a jumbo cut of 0.5 percentage points, or opt for the typical cut of 0.25 percentage points.",
      "\"Market odds currently see a 100% chance of a Fed rate cut this month, with a small constituent seeing an outsized 50-basis-point cut on Sept. 17 within the realm of possibility,\" Anthony Saglimbene, Ameriprise chief market strategist, wrote in a Sept. 8 research note.",
      "But, he added, if August's Consumer Price Index comes in hotter than expected on Sept. 11, that \"would likely throw cold water on the idea that the Fed is considering an outsized September rate cut.\"",
      "President Trump has\u00a0repeatedly lashed out at Powell\u00a0this year over the Fed's decision to keep interest rates level. In June, Mr. Trump publicly mused over\u00a0whether to fire him, although many legal experts say it's not clear he has the constitutional authority\u00a0to do so. Powell's term as Fed chair ends on May 15, 2026.",
      "Trump nominates replacement commissioner",
      "President Trump\u00a0in August announced E.J. Antoni as his nominee to lead the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Monday. Antoni, a fellow at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation, has\u00a0criticized the BLS, questioning its methodology.",
      "\"DOGE needs to take a chainsaw to the BLS...,\" he wrote in a November\u00a0post\u00a0on X.",
      "In a statement Monday backing the BLS, the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), a professional association of global economists, applied economists, data scientists and academics, said it \"stands firmly with the dedicated economists and statisticians at BLS and across the federal statistical agencies.\"",
      "The association went on to urge policymakers and others in the business and economics community \"to defend the integrity of the U.S. statistical system and ensure it remains the global gold standard,\" it said.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics needs a knowledgeable and qualified commissioner who will uphold the agency's mission and protect its trusted professional staff from political pressure. A commissioner with deep expertise and independence is essential to maintaining public trust, ensuring impartial analysis, and safeguarding the credibility of U.S. statistics,\" NABE added.",

      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations, the average \"perceived probability\" of finding a new job after losing one fell 5.8% points to 44.9% among heads of households surveyed in August, the lowest measure on record since 2013 when the New York Fed began collecting data.",
      "At the same time, Americans are increasingly worried about losing their current job. Expectations that the U.S. unemployment rate will be higher a year from now crept up 1.7 percentage points to 39.1%, the New York Fed found.",
      "The data comes as Americans adopt a dimmer view of the economy. According to a\u00a0recent CBS News poll, a majority of respondents continue to say the economy is getting worse.",
      "The labor market has been under a microscope since July employment data showed weaker-than-expected job growth and sharp downward revisions for the months of June and May. August's data, released Friday, pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, with employers adding only 22,000 jobs. Unemployment also ticked up to 4.3%, the highest rate since October 2022.",
      "\"Employers may be holding onto their current workers amid uncertainty, but they are not adding new positions,\" Allison Shrivastava, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"In turn, employees have taken the hint, staying in their current jobs rather than seeking new opportunities.\"",
      "According to a recent Bankrate survey, about half of Americans are planning to search for a new job in the next year. At the same time, data shows that the number of people changing jobs has slowed significantly since 2022, when millions of people quit their jobs during the \"Great Resignation.\"",
      "During this period, workers had more negotiating power because labor supply disruptions created heightened demand for workers. That balance, however, has started shifting back in favor of employers in recent years.",
      "A recent analysis from Bank of America shows that the percentage of its customers leaving their jobs has largely trended downward from a more than 26% peak in 2022, and is now just slightly above the job change rate in 2019, at 3.3%. Experts say that's mainly because there are fewer opportunities for people to switch jobs and general unease with the state of the labor market.",
      "\"If this stagnation continues, unemployment \u2014 and layoffs \u2014 will increase, further weakening the labor market,\" said Shrivastava.",
      "The Fed, which is tasked with maintaining a robust job market and low inflation, has acknowledged that the downside risks to employment are rising. This strengthens the likelihood that the central bank will cut rates at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Sept. 16 to 17.",

About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants an appeals court to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook before an interest rate meeting next week.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court Thursday to lift a ruling that blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, in time for a crucial meeting next week when Fed officials will decide whether to lower interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook from the Federal Reserve's powerful Board of Governors last month, accusing her of falsely claiming two different homes as her principal residence in mortgage documents. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb blocked the firing on Tuesday, concluding that the president \"has not stated a legally permissible cause for Cook's removal.\" Under federal law, Fed board members serve for 14-year terms and can only be removed \"for cause.\"",
      "On Thursday, the Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to stay that ruling while the government appeals it. The Justice Department argued that the president has broad discretion to remove federal officials, including to decide whether \"cause\" exists, and courts have \u2014 at most \u2014 extremely narrow authority to review those decisions.",
      "\"Here, the evidence\u2014which Cook has yet to offer contrary explanation for\u2014was that she applied for two loans for her personal benefit, and was able to obtain favorable interest rates by misrepresenting where she lived,\" the government argued Thursday. \"Regardless of whether that misconduct occurred before or during office, it indisputably calls into question Cook's trustworthiness and whether she can be a responsible steward of the interest rates and economy for the whole Nation.\"",
      "Those allegations surfaced in a letter from Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee who cited mortgage papers for homes that Cook bought in Georgia and Michigan in 2021. Abbe Lowell, an attorney representing Cook, called the government's accusations \"unsubstantiated and vague.\"",
      "The government requested that the appeals court act by the end of the day on Monday, noting that the Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is set to meet on Tuesday and Wednesday.",
      "Cook's attorneys asked the appellate court to deny the Trump administration's request, calling it \"wholly unwarranted.\"",
      "\"An administrative stay would threaten Governor Cook's participation in next week's meeting and potentially plunge the FOMC's vote into turmoil,\" Cook's attorneys wrote in court papers. \"In addition, it has the real potential of impacting domestic and foreign markets. The Government has provided no justification for such a grave disruption of the status quo.\"",
      "Why does the Fed committee matter?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 which includes Cook, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and 10 other top central bank officials \u2014 is responsible for setting the Fed's interest rate targets, which have a major impact on economic growth, inflation and borrowing costs. The panel typically acts independently, with little input from elected officials.",
      "The committee has voted to leave interest rates relatively high so far this year, but investors and economists widely expect it to reduce rates at next week's meeting. Rate cuts could lead to stronger economic growth, but at the risk of causing inflation to heat up.",
      "Mr. Trump has tangled with the Fed for months over its decision to keep rates steady, nicknaming Powell \"Mr. Too Late\" and arguing the rate-setting committee should overrule him. Powell's term ends in May.",
      "Amid that pressure, Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in late August. A Biden appointee, Cook's term on the Fed's seven-member Board of Governors is set to end in 2038. The allegations against Cook are not related to Mr. Trump's push against the Fed, but if she is removed from the board, the president could pick her replacement, giving him more influence over the central bank.",

      "When asked for a response to the Venezuelan minister, chief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell suggested the words of an \"illegitimate narco-terrorist regime\" should not be taken at face value. He reiterated the administration's assertion that the U.S. military would act to stop any drug traffickers in international waters or the western hemisphere.",
      "\"This strike sent a clear message: if you traffic drugs toward our shores, the United States military will use every tool at our disposal to stop you cold,\" Parnell said in a statement.",
      "The Pentagon did not respond to a question about whether the boat was turning around before it was hit.",
      "Facing questions about the legal justifications, including from lawmakers, the White House notified Congress last week that it believed the president was acting within his constitutional authority to order a strike on the boat.",
      "\"I directed these actions consistent with my responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests, pursuant to my constitutional authority as commander in chief and chief executive to conduct United States foreign relations,\" the Sept. 4 notification said.",
      "Mr. Trump also noted the potential for further military action.",
      "\"It is not possible at this time to know the full scope and duration of military operations that will be necessary,\" he said. \"United States forces remain postured to carry out further military operations.\"",

    "story": [
      "A suspect on trial for trying to assassinate President Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year forfeited his right to continue making an opening statement on Thursday when he veered off topic and talked about Adolf Hitler and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Ryan Routh, who is representing himself, was warned by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to stay on topic. The judge twice asked jurors to leave the courtroom so she could deal with the unconventional turn in Routh's opening statement.",
      "Both Routh and prosecutors had been given 40 minutes each to make opening statements, but Routh's initial argument, read from a written statement, lasted less than 10 minutes before the judge said he had forfeited the right to continue because he was addressing unrelated matters.",
      "In his rambling speech, Routh, seemingly on the verge of tears, spoke about a \"magical old cloth,\" and a \"wooden peg whittled.\"",
      "He asked questions such as \"Why are we here? ... What is our intent every day? ... How did we get so derailed and filled with hate?\" He also mentioned Hitler, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Routh did not follow the judge's instructions, leading the judge to cut him off.",
      "\"I gave you one more chance and you continued to read what has no relevance for this case,\" Cannon said.",
      "During the prosecution's opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Shipley told jurors that Routh wanted to make sure that Mr. Trump wasn't reelected to the White House.",
      "\"He needs to go away,\" Shipley told jurors that Routh said about Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh had military grade rifles, 10 phones, stolen license plates and a \"trail of lies that extended all the way from Honolulu, Hawaii to West Palm Beach, Florida,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh, 59, methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Just nine weeks earlier, Mr. Trump had survived another attempt on his life while campaigning in Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, killing an audience member and grazing Mr. Trump's ear, before being shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.",
      "Five witnesses testified Thursday, including two Secret Service agents, two FBI agents and a witness who followed Routh in his car after the incident so he could write down his license plate.",
      "Tommy McGee, the witness, testified that he was driving by the golf course when he heard the gunshot and saw a man running out of bushes into the street, almost hitting his car. McGee said the suspect looked at him straight in the eye. Once the suspect jumped in a car and fled, McGee said, he followed him out of a desire to help the police, not realizing that Mr. Trump was involved.",
      "Routh's cross-examination was unorthodox and brief. He asked only a few questions of the witnesses and when he did, he referred to himself in the third person, leading to some awkward exchanges with Secret Service Agent Robert Fercano, who had spotted him in the bushes. Routh asked the agent if he had been harmed by what happened, and Fercano replied, \"I wasn't physically harmed, but I was mentally harmed from you pointing a gun at me.\"",
      "Fercano described being in a golf cart only five feet from Routh when he saw him pointing a gun from the bushes.",
      "The trial began nearly a year after prosecutors say Fercano thwarted the attempt to shoot the Republican presidential nominee. It's\u00a0expected to run two or three weeks. The trial's start comes as police search for the gunman who killed conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a campus in Utah on Wednesday in what political leaders are calling an assassination.",

A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",

    "story": [
      "It was President Trump who announced that conservative commentator and activist Charlie Kirk had died after he was shot during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The president, who was close to Kirk, praised his appeal to young Americans and mourned him in a social media post.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the \"radical left\" for his killing. \"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said in a video posted to Truth Social. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Then, according to the House gallery, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked for a point of order \u2014 she reshared an X post that said she had asked for a moment of prayer. A Democrat yelled, \"No.\" Boebert and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, then started to speak out, as other lawmakers who appeared to be Democrats responded. One yelled, \"There was just a shooting in Colorado!\" Another said \"Pass some gun laws!\" Johnson repeatedly called for order.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News, Johnson explained what had happened. \"A motion was made on the floor to have a vocal prayer, and it turned into an argument,\" he said, adding, \"You know, that's where our politics are in the country right now. We have got to turn the heat down a little bit. We got to have civil discourse.\"",
      "\"The great tragic irony about this, one of the tragedies, is that Charlie represented that, the best of it,\" Johnson continued. \"He's the guy that was the champion out on the front lines having the debate, but he he loved the people that disagreed with him .... He loved it, and he loved the debate.\"",
      "\"That's what's so important for us to remember,\" Johnson said. \"We shouldn't regard one another as enemies. We're fellow Americans, and we should have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence. It's just too much.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a\u00a0change to Senate rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a blockade from Democrats, who have warned against the move to go \"nuclear.\"",
      "For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups.",
      "\"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place,\" Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with \"a Democrat pedigree,\" citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is \"not as extensive,\" noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. \"But the proposals share the same objective \u2014 and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge.\"",
      "The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the \"en bloc,\" or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.",
      "But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks.",
      "\"It's in their court,\" Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said \"basically\" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023.",
      "\"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan,\" Thune said.",
      "Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.",
      "After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.",
      "Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to \"think carefully before taking this step.\"",
      "\"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret,\" Schumer said.",
      "The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for walking away from a deal before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working \"in good faith with Republicans\" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks.",

John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying \"if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem\u2026 they wouldn't object, they would agree \u2014 it's their idea.\" But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.",
      "King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying \"we designed that for the next president.\"",

    "summary": "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals\u200b,\" in cookware.",
    "story": [
      "California lawmakers are weighing whether to ban a group of chemicals known as PFAS, which are often called \"forever chemicals,\" in cookware. The move has pulled in celebrity chefs on one side and environmentalists, including actor Mark Ruffalo, on the other.",
      "The proposal, Senate Bill 682, would prohibit PFAS in cookware, cleaning products, dental floss, ski wax, food packaging and certain children's products. The state Senate has already passed the bill and sent it to the state Assembly for consideration. Lawmakers face a Friday deadline to finalize the measure and send it to Gov. Gavin Newsom.",
      "It's the latest move to limit PFAS, which are a class of thousands of chemicals that have been around for more than 70 years and are widely used in a variety of consumer, commercial and industrial products due to their ability to withstand heat and repel water and stains. They are called \"forever chemicals\" because they are\u00a0extremely persistent in the environment\u00a0and can accumulate in humans and animals.",
      "Exposure to PFAS is linked to many negative health effects, including but not limited to kidney and testicular cancer, liver and kidney damage, and harm to the nervous and reproductive systems.",
      "The legislation specifically points to health risks as the reason for phasing out PFAS from cookware and other products. \"Exposure to PFAS poses a significant threat to the environment and public health,\" the bill states.",
      "Nearly everyone in the United States has been exposed to PFAS and has it in their blood, according to the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention. California and more than a dozen other states have in recent years taken a more cautionary stance by limiting PFAS in products.",
      "California has already banned PFAS in carpets, textiles and firefighting foam. Now, the latest debate centers on nonstick pans. Many are treated with a chemical compound called PTFE, a type of PFAS better known as Teflon, which coats millions of pans.",
      "Chefs push back",
      "The Cookware Sustainability Alliance, which describes itself as a group of cookware manufacturers, designers and engineers, has rallied high-profile culinary stars to oppose the bill. Chefs including Rachael Ray, Thomas Keller of the famed French Laundry restaurant in Napa, Marcus Samuelsson of Red Rooster in Harlem, and David Chang of Momofuku in New York City all submitted letters to lawmakers arguing nonstick pans are safe when manufactured and used correctly.",
      "\"I respect and share the desire to protect Californians and our planet, but I urge you to look closely at the science before moving forward with legislation that could unintentionally do more harm than good,\" Ray wrote. \"PTFEs, when manufactured and used responsibly, are proven to be safe and effective.\"",
      "Some chefs also argue that banning nonstick pans could make cooking more difficult and costly for families. \"Alternatives often do not perform with the same consistency, which can undermine the very goal of helping people cook nourishing meals at home,\" chef Einat Admony of Balaboosta in New York City wrote in her letter.",
      "\"We base everything on chemistry, on science,\" Steve Burns, executive director of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, said in an interview with CBS News. \"The Teflon coating around a nonstick pan is a fluoropolymer. Technically it falls under the PFAS family, but fluoropolymers have been shown for decades to be inert and non-harmful.\"",
      "The cookware industry says the bill unfairly targets a material that regulators, like the Food and Drug Administration, have repeatedly approved and deemed safe. \"Since the 1960s, the FDA has authorized PTFE\u00a0and other fluoropolymers for use in food-contact applications,\" Burns said. \"As recently as early 2025, the FDA reaffirmed that PTFE in nonstick coatings remains approved.\"",
      "The environmental community responds",
      "Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group have pushed back against the industry, saying everyday use of Teflon-coated cookware can release PFAS particles or fumes, especially when pans are scratched or overheated.",
      "\"PTFE is basically a plasticized version of PFAS,\" said Anna Reade, the NRDC's director of PFAS advocacy. She disagrees with industry claims that Teflon is safe because when nonstick cookware is overheated, she says, PFAS emissions come off the pans and can be inhaled or absorbed by the food cooking in the pan. A small scientific study supports Reade's claim.",
      "\"The other concern is that when you flake off and scrub off PTFE, you're breaking it into really small pieces,\" Reade said. Studies also suggest scratched pans may shed microplastics that could end up in food.",
      "Actor Mark Ruffalo, who starred in the 2019 film \"Dark Waters\" about PFAS contamination and is an outspoken critic of \"forever chemicals,\" weighed in on social platform X with an open letter to Ray. \"Independent science shows that the PFAS in cookware can wind up in our food,\" Ruffalo wrote. He went on to urge her to support the bill \"from the bottom of my heart.\"",
      "California state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Southern California who proposed the legislation, has also been vocal on social media pushing back against criticisms of the bill. \"PFAS have invaded every part of the world around us, including our very bodies and the food and water we consume,\" he told CBS News. \"SB 682 is a modest attempt to phase out more PFAS in California by focusing only on products which already face bans across the nation because safer alternatives widely exist in the marketplace.\"",
      "Allen emphasizes that the legislation aims to phase out PFAS in cookware and other items where substitutes exist. In place of nonstick cookware, stainless steel and cast-iron pans are possible replacements because they do not include Teflon coatings.",

      "But Kirk's politics weren't without controversy. Kirk pushed false claims about voter fraud after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, stoked skepticism about the COVID-19 pandemic and spread anti-trans rhetoric. He also amplified the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy, which is based on the belief that there's a plot to replace White people with minorities.",

      "Patel defended the moves against the senior agents in an interview with Larry Kudlow on the Fox Business Network, saying the firings were aimed at \"ridding this place of its former leadership structure that did that weaponization.\"",
      "The FBI declined to comment.",
      "The Justice Department and White House have not responded to a request for comment.",
      "Driscoll said of the lawsuit in a statement, \"I hope this effort results in protecting others who did no harm and committed no misconduct from wrongful consequences. The American people deserve an FBI made up of professionals who can serve righteously and confidently, with no fear of inappropriately applied pressure or wrongful termination.\"",
      "In his statement, Evans said the public's confidence in the FBI \"hinges on the commitment of every FBI employee, from the newest Special Agent to the Director, to relentlessly adhere to the rule of law without fear or favor.\"",
      "\"Americans should demand FBI leaders who make decisions based solely on the facts of an investigation and never on the desired outcome of one,\" Evans wrote.",
      "Jensen said in his statement that he joined the lawsuit \"to champion the values of truth and justice for those who continue to serve in the FBI.\"",
      "In filing the suit, Jensen said, \"we aim to re-establish the highest standards of justice and ensure that every American, particularly those entrusted with the immense authority of federal law enforcement, respects and obeys the law.\"",
      "Abbe David Lowell, who is representing them, said the Trump administration's termination of them was illegal.",
      "\"As the complaint makes clear, the leadership of the FBI is carrying out political orders to punish law enforcement agents for doing their jobs \u2013 it's illegal and it's putting the national security of our country at risk,\" he said. The three agents filed the case to try to vindicate their constitutional rights.",
      "The lawsuit specifically alleges that the FBI was pressured by White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, who wanted \"to see personnel action, like reassignment, removals and terminations at the FBI, similar to the firings and reassignments of senior attorneys at DOJ that had occurred since January 20, 2025.\"",
      "One focus of the purge involved FBI employees who were part of the Jan. 6 investigations, according to the complaint. The suit alleges that Emil Bove, who at the time was a senior top Justice Department official, told Driscoll about \"pressure he was receiving from (Stephen) Miller to conduct summary firings of agents.\"",
      "Mr. Trump later appointed Bove to the U.S. Court of Appeals. Driscoll said that when he raised concerns these actions would rattle rank-and-file agents, Bove's response took him by surprise.",
      "\"Bove stated that the creation of panic and anxiety in the workforce 'was the intent,'\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Driscoll's firing, in particular, surprised many inside the FBI because he appeared to be in good standing with Patel. A highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, Patel had indicated he admired him as a swashbuckling tactical operator, CBS News previously reported.",
      "During his short stint as acting director, Driscoll resisted calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who participated in the Jan. 6 investigation, earning him near folk-hero status among line agents.",
      "Patel nevertheless kept him on after he was confirmed as FBI director, putting him in charge of the most important and sensitive positions in the bureau.",
      "But his trajectory at the FBI in the wake of Trump's election reflected the chaos and partisan politics that typified the presidential transition.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Trump transition team members reached out to Driscoll about assuming a senior leadership role in an acting capacity. He soon learned it was to be acting deputy FBI director. After agreeing to be vetted for the position, according to the complaint, Driscoll was questioned by a 29-year-old transition aide who asked him a series of questions that seemed to seek information about his political loyalties.",
      "Among the questions recounted by Driscoll in the lawsuit: \"Who did you vote for?\" \"Do you agree that the FBI agents who stormed Mar-a-Lago, to include the rank-and-file, should be held accountable?\" \"What are your thoughts on DEI?\" And, \"Have you voted for a Democrat in the last five elections?\"",
      "Driscoll defended the actions of the agents in the Mar-a-Lago search \"for doing their job\" and said he \"strongly believes in diversity and a diverse workforce.\" He refused to answer the other questions, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Jensen also appeared to have Patel's backing before he was fired. A veteran agent who helped oversee the January 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, Jensen was given a significant promotion by Patel, who appointed him assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, which the complaint identifies as one of the largest field offices in the country.",
      "The promotion had inflamed a noisy portion of Trump's MAGA base because of his supervisory role in the Jan. 6 case. They torched him and the decision on social media, but Patel continued to praise Jensen in meetings and even presented him with a director's \"challenge coin,\" a token of appreciation that leaders in the military and law enforcement often bestow on their subordinates.",

      "Washington \u2014 Former Vice President Kamala Harris writes that former President Joe Biden's decision to run again was a choice that shouldn't have \"been left to an individuals' ego, an individual's ambition,\" according to excerpts of her upcoming book, \"107 Days,\" published Wednesday in The Atlantic.",
      "Harris, who suddenly became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president in July 2024 when Biden dropped out of the race with 107 days until Election Day, criticized the \"recklessness\" of leaving that decision to the former president and first lady alone.",
      "\"'It's Joe and Jill's decision.' We all said that, like a mantra, as if we'd all been hypnotized,\" Harris writes, according to The Atlantic. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn't a choice that should have been left to an individual's ego, an individual's ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.\"",
      "Harris contemplated that \"perhaps\" she should have told the president to consider not running again, but said that of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out,\" according to The Atlantic excerpts. Harris wrote she knew it would appear \"incredibly self-serving\" if she advised him not to run.",
      "Harris' book is also deeply critical of the president's team, saying his inner circle often wouldn't defend her against unfair attacks.",
      "\"Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,\" she writes.",
      "Harris claimed the president's staff \"was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me,\" including the narrative that she ran a \"chaotic\" office.",
      "The former vice president also offers some defense of Biden's capacity as president, while acknowledging he \"got tired.\"",
      "\"On his worst day, he was more deeply knowledgeable, more capable of exercising judgment, and far more compassionate than Donald Trump on his best,\" she writes. \"But at 81, Joe got tired. \u2026 I don't believe it was incapacity. If I believed that, I would have said so. As loyal as I am to President Biden, I am more loyal to my country.\"",
      "Harris, 60, announced this summer that she won't run for governor of California next year, fueling speculation that she may make another bid for president in 2028. Her book is scheduled to be released Sept. 23.",

      "In the letter, Nicolosi pointed to the Labor Department recently announcing large downward revisions to its earlier estimates of payroll gains. BLS released figures on Tuesday showing that the U.S. labor market added more than 900,000 fewer jobs in the 12-month period ending March 2025 than had earlier been reported.",
      "The BLS produces its monthly employment report by conducting separate surveys of households and businesses. The Labor Department also taps other measures of how the job market is faring, including state unemployment claims. The Labor Department frequently issues revisions to figures from prior months as more complete or accurate data is collected over time.",
      "The internal review of BLS' methods also will examine how it collects, reports and revises data used in two closely watched gauges of inflation \u2014 the Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index \u2014 Nicolosi said. Recent data show that inflation around the U.S. has risen this year.",
      "President Trump last month fired then BLS commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of political bias after the Labor Department's July employment report showed unexpectedly weak job growth and revised down payroll gains for the previous two months.",
      "\"I have directed my Team to fire this Biden Political Appointee, IMMEDIATELY. She will be replaced with someone much more competent and qualified.

    "summary": "Exoplanet TRAPPIST-1 e may contain an atmosphere and liquid water, NASA scientists said. Research into the exoplanet is ongoing.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists are observing an Earth-like exoplanet that may contain water using NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, the space agency said in a news release.",
      "The exoplanet, known as TRAPPIST-1 e, orbits the red dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. The system was discovered in 2017. There are seven Earth-sized worlds orbiting the star, but planet e is the only one that is at a distance where water on the surface is \"theoretically possible,\" NASA said. However, astronomers still need to determine if the planet has an atmosphere.",
      "To look for an atmosphere, NASA scientists directed the Webb telescope's Near-Infrared Spectrograph instrument at the TRAPPIST-1 system as planet e passed in front of the star. If the planet has an atmosphere, the starlight that passes through it will be partially absorbed. That will create dips in the light spectrum that reaches the spectrograph. Those dips will allow scientists to determine if the planet has an atmosphere and what chemicals it might be made of.",
      "Scientists are also studying the light spectrum of another exoplanet in the system called TRAPPIST-1 b. Researchers have determined that planet has no atmosphere, NASA said, so comparing its output to that of TRAPPIST-1 e allows for a fuller picture of the potential atmosphere on that planet.",
      "\"Webb's infrared instruments are giving us more detail than we've ever had access to before, and the initial four observations we've been able to make of planet e are showing us what we will have to work with when the rest of the information comes in,\" said N\u00e9stor Espinoza of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, a principal investigator on the research team. Espinoza and the research team recently published two\u00a0scientific\u00a0papers\u00a0outlining their initial results.",
      "Researchers \"feel confident\" that TRAPPIST-1 e does not have a primary atmosphere. A primary atmosphere would be made of hydrogen and helium that would have been present when the planet was formed. But the star the planet orbits is \"very active,\" with \"frequent flares,\" NASA said, which create stellar radiation that may have \"stripped off\" that primary atmosphere. However, TRAPPIST-1 e may have built up a \"heavier secondary atmosphere.\" Many planets, including Earth, have done this, NASA said. Further research with the Webb telescope and its instruments will determine the types of atmosphere and its makeup.",
      "There are also many possibilities for water on the planet. There may be none at all, NASA said. TRAPPIST-1 e might also contain an ocean or wide swath of water. One side of the planet is always in darkness, so there may also be ice, NASA said. If there is liquid water on the planet, the NASA researchers say there would also be a greenhouse effect, where gases like carbon dioxide keep the atmosphere stable and warm the planet.",
      "\"We are really still in the early stages of learning what kind of amazing science we can do with Webb. It's incredible to measure the details of starlight around Earth-sized planets 40 light-years away and learn what it might be like there, if life could be possible there,\" said Ana Glidden, a post-doctoral researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, who led the research on possible atmospheres for planet e, in NASA's news release. \"We're in a new age of exploration that's very exciting to be a part of,\" she said.",

      "Two law enforcement sources told CBS News Thursday that U.S. Marshals were assisting the FBI in tracking down the suspected shooter. The FBI remains the lead investigating agency but is working with Utah officials.",
      "Utah Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said the suspect was a male who \"blended in\" with the college community and appears to be \"college-age.\"",
      "Mason said investigators have been able to track the shooter's movements before and after the assassination. He said the gunman is believed to have arrived on campus at 11:52 a.m. local time Wednesday and moved through stairwells to the roof of a building near where Kirk's event was taking place, which was the shooting location.",
      "Mason said the shooter moved to the other side of the building after firing a single shot, then jumped off and fled into a neighborhood off campus. Investigators contacted homeowners with cameras, and witnesses, to identify leads, he said.",

      "Weapon recovered",
      "FBI special-agent-in-charge Robert Bohls said Thursday that investigators recovered a \"high-powered, bolt-action rifle,\" which they believe was the weapon used in the assassination. It was found in a wooded area where the shooter fled and will be analyzed by the FBI, according to Bohls.",

      "Kirk was struck in the neck at around 12 p.m. local time Wednesday by a single gunshot, which the perpetrator fired as Kirk addressed a large crowd at an outdoor \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate on Utah Valley University's campus in Orem, Utah.",
      "The \"Prove Me Wrong\" debate is a trademark event for Kirk's Turning Point USA, a conservative organization focused on young people, where he would hold political debates with a group that usually consisted of left-leaning attendees. Kirk had visited the Utah school as part of a nationwide tour of college campuses that was scheduled to continue for the next two months. About 3,000 people attended the outdoor event, the Utah Department of Public Safety said in a statement.",
      "While authorities have not specified a potential motive for the shooting, Mason said they believe it was a \"targeted attack toward one individual.\" Only one shot was fired, and Kirk was the only victim, according to the commissioner.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox called the shooting \"a political assassination,\" while President Trump, in a video posted to Truth Social, blamed it on \"radical left political violence,\" which he said \"has hurt too many innocent people and taken too many lives.\" Mr. Trump vowed to \"find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity.\" Kirk was a close Trump ally and was credited with galvanizing younger voters during his campaign.",
      "Bohls reiterated Thursday that investigators consider the shooting to be a \"targeted event,\" and do not believe there are lingering risks to the public.",
      "Shooting location",

      "Video verified by CBS News shows a person running across the building's roof in the moments after the shooting, about 400 feet from where Kirk was speaking. Authorities have not confirmed whether that person is connected to the attack. Drone video captured afterward shows police tape on the roof where the person was seen.",
      "On Thursday, Bohls of the FBI said investigators had received over 130 tips and that those tips and other leads were being \"fully investigated.\"",

    "story": [
      "A suspect on trial for trying to assassinate President Trump while he played golf in South Florida last year forfeited his right to continue making an opening statement on Thursday when he veered off topic and talked about Adolf Hitler and the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Ryan Routh, who is representing himself, was warned by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon to stay on topic. The judge twice asked jurors to leave the courtroom so she could deal with the unconventional turn in Routh's opening statement.",
      "Both Routh and prosecutors had been given 40 minutes each to make opening statements, but Routh's initial argument, read from a written statement, lasted less than 10 minutes before the judge said he had forfeited the right to continue because he was addressing unrelated matters.",
      "In his rambling speech, Routh, seemingly on the verge of tears, spoke about a \"magical old cloth,\" and a \"wooden peg whittled.\"",
      "He asked questions such as \"Why are we here? ... What is our intent every day? ... How did we get so derailed and filled with hate?\" He also mentioned Hitler, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "Routh did not follow the judge's instructions, leading the judge to cut him off.",
      "\"I gave you one more chance and you continued to read what has no relevance for this case,\" Cannon said.",
      "During the prosecution's opening statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Shipley told jurors that Routh wanted to make sure that Mr. Trump wasn't reelected to the White House.",
      "\"He needs to go away,\" Shipley told jurors that Routh said about Mr. Trump.",
      "\"This plot was carefully crafted and deadly serious,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh had military grade rifles, 10 phones, stolen license plates and a \"trail of lies that extended all the way from Honolulu, Hawaii to West Palm Beach, Florida,\" Shipley said.",
      "Routh has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempting to assassinate a major presidential candidate, assaulting a federal officer and several firearm violations.",
      "Prosecutors have said Routh, 59, methodically plotted to kill Mr. Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Mr. Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024, at his West Palm Beach country club. A Secret Service agent spotted Routh before Mr. Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot.",
      "Just nine weeks earlier, Mr. Trump had survived another attempt on his life while campaigning in Pennsylvania. That gunman had fired eight shots, killing an audience member and grazing Mr. Trump's ear, before being shot by a Secret Service counter sniper.",
      "Five witnesses testified Thursday, including two Secret Service agents, two FBI agents and a witness who followed Routh in his car after the incident so he could write down his license plate.",
      "Tommy McGee, the witness, testified that he was driving by the golf course when he heard the gunshot and saw a man running out of bushes into the street, almost hitting his car. McGee said the suspect looked at him straight in the eye. Once the suspect jumped in a car and fled, McGee said, he followed him out of a desire to help the police, not realizing that Mr. Trump was involved.",
      "Routh's cross-examination was unorthodox and brief. He asked only a few questions of the witnesses and when he did, he referred to himself in the third person, leading to some awkward exchanges with Secret Service Agent Robert Fercano, who had spotted him in the bushes. Routh asked the agent if he had been harmed by what happened, and Fercano replied, \"I wasn't physically harmed, but I was mentally harmed from you pointing a gun at me.\"",
      "Fercano described being in a golf cart only five feet from Routh when he saw him pointing a gun from the bushes.",
      "The trial began nearly a year after prosecutors say Fercano thwarted the attempt to shoot the Republican presidential nominee. It's\u00a0expected to run two or three weeks. The trial's start comes as police search for the gunman who killed conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a campus in Utah on Wednesday in what political leaders are calling an assassination.",
      "Cannon is a Trump-appointed judge who drew scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case accusing Trump of illegally storing classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach.",
      "Routh was a North Carolina construction worker who in recent years had moved to Hawaii. A self-styled mercenary leader, Routh spoke out to anyone who would listen about his dangerous, sometimes violent plans to insert himself into conflicts around the world, witnesses have told The Associated Press.",
      "In the early days of the war in Ukraine, Routh tried to recruit soldiers from Afghanistan, Moldova and Taiwan to fight the Russians. In his native Greensboro, North Carolina, he was arrested in 2002 for eluding a traffic stop and barricading himself from officers with a fully automatic machine gun and a \"weapon of mass destruction,\" which turned out to be an explosive with a 10-inch fuse.",

    "story": [
      "It was President Trump who announced that conservative commentator and activist Charlie Kirk had died after he was shot during a Turning Point USA event at Utah Valley University on Wednesday afternoon. The president, who was close to Kirk, praised his appeal to young Americans and mourned him in a social media post.",
      "\"The Great, and even Legendary, Charlie Kirk, is dead. No one understood or had the Heart of the Youth in the United States of America better than Charlie. He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president also ordered flags to be lowered to half-staff until Sunday evening to honor Kirk.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump released a video statement about Kirk, blaming the \"radical left\" for his killing. \"For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals,\" he said in a video posted to Truth Social. \"This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.\"",
      "Democratic and Republican politicians alike condemned Kirk's murder, although among some in Congress, there were disagreements about how to observe his death on the House floor. Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to hold a moment of silence for Kirk. Then, according to the House gallery, GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado asked for a point of order \u2014 she reshared an X post that said she had asked for a moment of prayer. A Democrat yelled, \"No.\" Boebert and Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, then started to speak out, as other lawmakers who appeared to be Democrats responded. One yelled, \"There was just a shooting in Colorado!\" Another said \"Pass some gun laws!\" Johnson repeatedly called for order.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News, Johnson explained what had happened. \"A motion was made on the floor to have a vocal prayer, and it turned into an argument,\" he said, adding, \"You know, that's where our politics are in the country right now. We have got to turn the heat down a little bit. We got to have civil discourse.\"",
      "\"The great tragic irony about this, one of the tragedies, is that Charlie represented that, the best of it,\" Johnson continued. \"He's the guy that was the champion out on the front lines having the debate, but he he loved the people that disagreed with him .... He loved it, and he loved the debate.\"",
      "\"That's what's so important for us to remember,\" Johnson said. \"We shouldn't regard one another as enemies. We're fellow Americans, and we should have vigorous debate, but it cannot lead to political violence. It's just too much.\"",
      "Vance: \"You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance posted a lenghty tribute to Kirk on X late Wednesday night saying Kirk advocated \"in public and private\" for President Trump to pick him as his running mate last year, following what Vance described as an eight-year-long friendship with the conservative commentator.",
      "Vance tells how Kirk advised him during his 2022 Senate campaign and says that, during the 2024 run for the White House, \"Some of our most successful events were organized not by the campaign, but by TPUSA (Turning Point USA).\" Vance adds that Kirk \"didn't just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.\"",
      "\"Charlie Kirk was a true friend. The kind of guy you could say something to and know it would always stay with him,\" Vance writes.",
      "He concludes by saying, \"And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.   You ran a good race, my friend.   We've got it from here.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nadine Menendez, the wife of former New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, was sentenced to 54 months, or more than four years, in prison Thursday in her federal bribery case.",
      "She was convicted in April of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash and gold bars in exchange for political favors. Other alleged bribes included a Mercedes-Benz, and money for a mortgage payment and for a low-to-no-show job.",
      "Prosecutors wanted Nadine Menendez, 58, to serve at least seven years, but her defense requested a one-year sentence, citing her ongoing breast cancer treatments. Her attorney said he's concerned that she won't get proper care in prison and that she's dealing with pain from surgeries that didn't go well.",
      "Federal sentencing guidelines call for a minimum of 17 and a half years, but Judge Sidney H. Stein had said he planned to hand down a sentence that was \"substantially below\" that. He also said he would not remand her Thursday, and set a surrender date for July 10, 2026.",
      "The exact sentence is 54 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. She was also ordered to pay $1,400.",
      "Judge Stein said he considered all factors, including her childhood trauma, her cancer diagnosis and charitable work, but he also said she was \"a central participant\" in the scheme. He referenced the trial of her co-defendants, during which he says they described her as the true force behind the conspiracies.",
      "\"You are not the person they tried to depict,\" Judge Stein said, adding her attorneys painted her as an innocent observer, which was not the case, either. \"You knew what you were doing.\"",
      "Nadine Menendez speaks at sentencing",
      "After both sides presented their arguments Thursday, Nadine Menendez tearfully addressed the court. She told Judge Stein that Bob Menendez was like a savior following her divorce from a previous abusive relationship, and that she blindly did what he asked. She said she never imagined someone with his power and rank putting her in a position to do something illegal.",
      "She added she takes full accountability, saying, \"I was wrong about my husband.\" As she left the courthouse, she was asked whether she would divorce the former senator and replied, \"No.\"",
      "Bob Menendez resigned from the U.S. Senate weeks after being found guilty for his role in the bribery scheme, and he is currently serving an 11-year sentence. He has vowed to appeal his conviction.",

      "An FBI search of the couple's home turned up more than $480,000 in cash stuffed in envelopes hidden in various places, along with gold bars and $70,000 in Nadine Menendez's safe deposit box.",
      "During opening statements at her trial, prosecutors told jurors \"she did the dirty work,\" alleging Nadine and Bob Menendez \"engaged in a corrupt relationship with three New Jersey associates and businessmen\" and provided Egyptian government officials with sensitive information.",
      "\"Nadine Menendez and Sen. Menendez were partners in crime. Over the span of five years, Nadine Menendez agreed to accept and accepted all sorts of bribes -- including gold bars, cash, a Mercedes-Benz convertible, and a no-show job -- all in exchange for the senator's corrupt official acts,\" Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said after her guilty verdict. \"Together, Nadine Menendez and the senator placed their own interests and greed ahead of the interests of the citizens the senator was elected to serve.\"",

    "summary": "Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on, but Republicans refused.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans moved ahead Thursday with a\u00a0change to Senate rules to make it easier to confirm President Trump's nominees amid a blockade from Democrats, who have warned against the move to go \"nuclear.\"",
      "For months, Republicans have criticized Democrats' efforts to slow the confirmation process, which they have taken to new extremes in recent months in protest to the president's policies. And after weeks of discussion among Senate Republicans, Senate Majority Leader John Thune kickstarted the rule change process earlier this week, announcing a proposal to consider non-cabinet executive branch nominees in groups.",
      "\"We've got a crisis, and it's time to take steps to restore Senate precedent and codify in Senate rules what once was understood to be standard practice, and that is the Senate acting expeditiously on presidential nominations to allow a president to get his team into place,\" Thune said as he announced he would take procedural steps to change the rules.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has touted the proposal as one with \"a Democrat pedigree,\" citing a 2023 proposal to codify en bloc nominations of up to 10 nominees in Senate rules. Thune argued the GOP measure is \"not as extensive,\" noting that it applies to subcabinet level nominees and not judicial nominees. \"But the proposals share the same objective \u2014 and that is providing for confirming groups of nominees all together so the president can have its team in place and so the Senate can focus on the important legislative work in its charge.\"",
      "The majority leader filed a resolution Monday to authorize the \"en bloc,\" or all at once, consideration of 48 nominees. Heading into the day Thursday, the Senate was set to take a procedural vote on the resolution, which was expected to fall short of the 60-vote threshold needed to advance most measures in the upper chamber. Senate Republicans then planned to move to overrule the chair, lowering the threshold to a simple majority.",
      "But the possibility of a last-minute bipartisan deal began emerging Thursday, bringing the Senate floor to a standstill amid talks.",
      "\"It's in their court,\" Thune told reporters of a possible deal with Democrats, which he said \"basically\" resembled a proposal that Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and independent Sen. Angus King of Maine introduced in 2023.",
      "\"If they aren't willing to do that, then we'll proceed with the other plan,\" Thune said.",
      "Though a deal appeared within grasp early Thursday afternoon, Democrats ultimately pushed for more time to iron things out and secure support as the day stretched on. Republicans refused, teeing up the vote that would kickstart the rule change and resuming their original plan.",
      "After a procedural vote on the resolution fell short of 60 votes, Thune made a point of order before appealed the ruling of the chair. In a 53 to 45 vote along party lines, the Senate voted to overrule the chair.",
      "Because the Senate often relies on unanimous consent to speed up floor consideration, any single senator can delay the process. And in recent years, both Democrats and Republicans have made pushes to change the confirmation process, including by cutting down the time requirements for the nominations and reducing the number of votes needed to a simple majority.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has pushed back on the GOP effort, telling Senate Republicans to \"think carefully before taking this step.\"",
      "\"If you go nuclear, it's going to be a decision you will come to regret,\" Schumer said.",
      "The minority leader has repeatedly criticized the White House for walking away from a deal before the August recess involving the release of already appropriated funds in exchange for cooperation from Democrats to swiftly approve a group of nominees. Schumer has said Democrats were working \"in good faith with Republicans\" on a nominations package, noting that Thune was very involved and seemed willing to come to an agreement, before Mr. Trump torpedoed the talks.",
      "\"Now, rather than giving those talks another chance, Republicans would rather change how the Senate operates to weaken this chamber's traditional and powerful sense of deliberation, Schumer said. \"And if Republicans go nuclear, the historically bad nominees we've seen so far under Donald Trump will get only worse.\"",
      "With more than 1,000 positions requiring Senate confirmation, the process is an arduous one that has become more cumbersome in recent years. According to the Center for Presidential Transition, the average time to confirm a president's nominee has nearly quadrupled during the last six administrations.",
      "In 2023, Klobuchar and King introduced a proposal that would have allowed up to 10 nominees reported by the same Senate to be quickly confirmed. Senate Republicans have repeatedly cited the legislation in recent days as they pursue their rule change, and Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, attempted to secure passage of a similar resolution on Tuesday under unanimous consent, saying \"if Democrats were really interested in solving the problem\u2026 they wouldn't object, they would agree \u2014 it's their idea.\" But one Democrat, Sen. Alex Padilla of California, objected, suggesting the effort should take effect in the next administration.",
      "King told CBS News that his and Klobuchar's legislation was intended for future administrations, saying \"we designed that for the next president.\"",
      "\"That would take it out of the politics of the moment,\" King said. \"Now, all of a sudden, they're dusting it off for use today.\"",

      "\"I respect and share the desire to protect Californians and our planet, but I urge you to look closely at the science before moving forward with legislation that could unintentionally do more harm than good,\" Ray wrote. \"PTFEs, when manufactured and used responsibly, are proven to be safe and effective.\"",
      "Some chefs also argue that banning nonstick pans could make cooking more difficult and costly for families. \"Alternatives often do not perform with the same consistency, which can undermine the very goal of helping people cook nourishing meals at home,\" chef Einat Admony of Balaboosta in New York City wrote in her letter.",
      "\"We base everything on chemistry, on science,\" Steve Burns, executive director of the Cookware Sustainability Alliance, said in an interview with CBS News. \"The Teflon coating around a nonstick pan is a fluoropolymer. Technically it falls under the PFAS family, but fluoropolymers have been shown for decades to be inert and non-harmful.\"",
      "The cookware industry says the bill unfairly targets a material that regulators, like the Food and Drug Administration, have repeatedly approved and deemed safe. \"Since the 1960s, the FDA has authorized PTFE\u00a0and other fluoropolymers for use in food-contact applications,\" Burns said. \"As recently as early 2025, the FDA reaffirmed that PTFE in nonstick coatings remains approved.\"",
      "The environmental community responds",
      "Environmental groups including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Environmental Working Group have pushed back against the industry, saying everyday use of Teflon-coated cookware can release PFAS particles or fumes, especially when pans are scratched or overheated.",
      "\"PTFE is basically a plasticized version of PFAS,\" said Anna Reade, the NRDC's director of PFAS advocacy. She disagrees with industry claims that Teflon is safe because when nonstick cookware is overheated, she says, PFAS emissions come off the pans and can be inhaled or absorbed by the food cooking in the pan. A small scientific study supports Reade's claim.",
      "\"The other concern is that when you flake off and scrub off PTFE, you're breaking it into really small pieces,\" Reade said. Studies also suggest scratched pans may shed microplastics that could end up in food.",
      "Actor Mark Ruffalo, who starred in the 2019 film \"Dark Waters\" about PFAS contamination and is an outspoken critic of \"forever chemicals,\" weighed in on social platform X with an open letter to Ray. \"Independent science shows that the PFAS in cookware can wind up in our food,\" Ruffalo wrote. He went on to urge her to support the bill \"from the bottom of my heart.\"",
      "California state Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat from Southern California who proposed the legislation, has also been vocal on social media pushing back against criticisms of the bill. \"PFAS have invaded every part of the world around us, including our very bodies and the food and water we consume,\" he told CBS News. \"SB 682 is a modest attempt to phase out more PFAS in California by focusing only on products which already face bans across the nation because safer alternatives widely exist in the marketplace.\"",
      "Allen emphasizes that the legislation aims to phase out PFAS in cookware and other items where substitutes exist. In place of nonstick cookware, stainless steel and cast-iron pans are possible replacements because they do not include Teflon coatings.",

    "summary": "Today's CPI report marks the last major piece of economic data before the Federal Reserve's Sept. 17 rate decision meeting.",
    "story": [
      "The Consumer Price Index rose 2.9% in August from a year earlier, matching economists' forecasts that prices would pick up slightly as President Trump's tariffs filtered through the economy.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The CPI was expected to rise 2.9% last month, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet.",
      "The CPI, a basket of goods and services typically bought by consumers, tracks the change in prices on everyday items such as food and apparel over time. So far this year, inflation has stayed at 3% or lower, with July's CPI reading at 2.7%.",
      "Despite that, inflation has been creeping higher in recent months, edging away from the Federal Reserve's\u00a02% annual target.\u00a0That's causing some Americans to feel more sour about the economy, with a recent\u00a0CBS News poll\u00a0finding that two-thirds of consumers said prices in the past few weeks have continued to rise.",
      "What economists say",
      "Some economists point to the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs as pushing prices higher. That's because U.S. businesses pay the import duties to the federal government and then pass on some of those costs to consumers in the form of costlier goods.",
      "So far in 2025, the Federal Reserve has held off on cutting rates due to the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation. Because rate reductions make it cheaper to borrow, they can spur businesses and consumers to open their wallets, adding to inflationary pressures.",
      "Yet with the labor market showing signs of strain, Fed Chair Jerome Powell last month signaled that the door may be open for a rate cut at the central bank's Sept. 17 meeting. Cutting rates can spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to borrow, and therefore easier to expand and add employees.",
      "Under the Fed's so-called \"dual mandate,\" the central bank is required to promote full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "Despite the rise in inflation, the Fed is likely still on track for a rate cut next week, said Seema Shah, Chief Global Strategist at Principal Asset Management, noting that the weaker jobs data will likely outweigh concerns about higher prices.",
      "\"While the CPI report is a tad hotter than expected, it will not give the Fed a moment of hesitation when they announce a rate cut next week,\" she said in an email.",
      "What's getting pricier",
      "Some items getting more expensive are products that are largely imported, such as coffee, which soared 21.7% from a year ago, and furniture, which rose 4.7%. Imports are subject to U.S. tariffs based on country of origin, with the Trump administration adding new duties that start at 10% and scale higher.",
      "\"There were once again some signs of tariff effects putting upward pressure on goods prices,\" noted Capital Economics in a research note, pointing to higher costs for appliances and other home products.",
      "Day-to-day costs also increased at a faster pace, with food prices rising by 3.2% from a year ago, largely driven by higher restaurant prices, the data showed.",
      "Those pressures are being felt by many consumers, with some telling CBS News that their expenses have only increased in the past year. Some say that they're cutting back on discretionary spending to cope with a rise in household costs.",
      "\"Everything overall is more expensive \u2014 my groceries for example \u2014 and I hope for things that are on sale. I plan everything we're going to have for the week,\" said Kali Daugherty, 40, an executive director of a nonprofit in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.",

      "Bolsonaro, who has always denied any wrongdoing, is currently under house arrest in Brasilia. He can appeal the ruling.",
      "Four of the five justices reviewing the case in the panel found the far-right politician guilty on five counts, in a ruling that will deepen political divisions and was expected to prompt a backlash from the U.S. government. It makes Bolsonaro is the first former Brazilian president to be convicted of attempting a coup.",
      "The far-right politician governed Brazil between 2019 and 2022.",

      "The ministry had said the flight was expected to take off on Wednesday, but that it was delayed due to unspecified circumstances in the U.S. On Thursday, President Lee said the delay was caused by discussion that was ongoing Wednesday over the details of the transport arrangements for the South Korean nationals between the ICE detention facility and the Atlanta airport.",

    "published": "Thu, 11 Sep 2025 12:26:15 -0400",
    "summary": "Internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom has faced copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering charges in the U.S. for more than a decade.",
    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand\u00a0\u2014 A New Zealand court has rejected the latest bid by internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom to halt his deportation to the United States on charges related to his file-sharing website Megaupload.",
      "Dotcom had asked the High Court to review the legality of an official's August 2024 decision that he should be surrendered to the U.S. to face trial on charges of copyright infringement, money laundering and racketeering. It was the latest chapter in a protracted 13-year battle by the U.S. government to extradite the Finnish-German millionaire from New Zealand.",
      "The Megaupload founder had applied for what in New Zealand is called a judicial review, in which a judge is asked to evaluate whether an official's decision was lawful.",
      "A judge on Wednesday dismissed Dotcom's arguments that the decision to deport him was politically motivated and that he would face grossly disproportionate treatment in the U.S. In a written ruling, Justice Christine Grice also rejected Dotcom's claim that New Zealand's police were wrong to charge his business partners, but not him, under domestic laws - which likely yielded laxer sentences than if the men had been tried in the U.S.",
      "The latest decision could be challenged in the Court of Appeal, where a deadline for filing is Oct. 8. It wasn't immediately clear if Dotcom would do so.",
      "One of his lawyers, Ron Mansfield, told Radio New Zealand that Dotcom's team had \"much fight left in us as we seek to secure a fair outcome,\" but he didn't elaborate.",
      "Neither Dotcom nor Mansfield responded to a request for comment from The Associated Press on Thursday.",
      "New Zealand's government hasn't disclosed what will happen next in the extradition process or divulged an expected timeline for Dotcom to be surrendered to the United States.",
      "The saga stretches back to the January 2012 arrest by New Zealand authorities of Dotcom in a dramatic raid on his Auckland mansion, along with other company officers, at the request of the FBI. U.S. prosecutors said Megaupload raked in at least $175 million, mainly from people who used the site to illegally download songs, television shows and movies, before the FBI shut it down earlier that year.",
      "Lawyers for Dotcom and the others arrested argued that it was the users of the site, founded in 2005, who chose to pirate material, not its founders. But prosecutors said the men were the architects of a vast criminal enterprise, with the Department of Justice describing it as the largest criminal copyright case in U.S. history.",
      "He has been free on bail in New Zealand since February 2012.",
      "Interviewed at his sprawling home by 60 Minutes in 2014, Dotcom told correspondent Bob Simon that he was inspired to seek his riches by the James Bond movies, \"where, you know, some characters had private islands and super tankers converted into yachts and space stations and underwater homes. So, you know, I got inspired by that.\"",
      "\"But you're not playing James Bond, you're playing Dr. No,\" suggested Simon.",
      "\"That's what everybody says,\" replied the web entrepreneur.",
      "Dotcom and his business partners fought the FBI's efforts to extradite them for years, including by challenging New Zealand law enforcement's actions during the investigation and arrests. In 2021, however, New Zealand's Supreme Court ruled that Dotcom and two other men could be surrendered.",
      "Under New Zealand law, it remained up to the country's justice minister to decide if the extradition should proceed. The minister, Paul Goldsmith, ruled in August 2024 that it should. \u00a0 \u00a0  But by then, Dotcom was the only person whose fate remained in question. Two of his former business partners, Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk, pleaded guilty to charges against them in a New Zealand court in June 2023 and were sentenced to two and a half years in jail.",
      "In exchange, U.S. efforts to extradite them were dropped. Part of Dotcom's latest legal bid challenged the police decision not to extend a plea deal under New Zealand laws to him, too.",
      "Grice rejected that, saying the choice to only charge Ortmann and van der Kolk in New Zealand was \"a proper exercise of the Police's discretion.\" The jurist also dismissed Dotcom's claim that Goldsmith's extradition decision was politically motivated.",
      "Prosecutors earlier abandoned their extradition bid against a fourth Megaupload officer, Finn Batato, who was arrested in New Zealand. Batato returned to Germany, where he died from cancer in 2022.",
      "In November 2024, Dotcom said in a post on X that he had suffered a stroke. He wrote on X in July that he was making \"good progress\" in his recovery but still suffered from speech and memory impairments.",
      "Goldsmith's decision that Dotcom should be extradited was made before the stroke. But Grice said the minister had considered other \"significant health conditions\" Dotcom faced and wasn't wrong to conclude that these shouldn't prevent him from being deported.",

    "summary": "Trump says he assured Qatar's leader that Israeli strikes against Hamas in Doha wouldn't be repeated. Netanyahu has threatened to do just that.",
    "story": [
      "As the people killed in Israel's surprise strike on a Hamas meeting in the Qatari capital were buried at Doha's Grand Mosque on Thursday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatened to launch new attacks on the country \u2014 a close U.S. ally \u2014 if it refused to eject the U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist group's political representatives.",
      "Qatar's government has condemned Israel's Tuesday strikes, saying the \"criminal attack constitutes a blatant violation of all international laws and norms, and poses a serious threat to the security and safety of the State of Qatar and its people.\"",
      "The U.S. has relied on Qatar to act as a go-between with Hamas, with which it has long had ties. Working through Hamas' political office in Doha, both the Trump administration and the Biden administration before that have pushed hard, along with Egypt, to broker a ceasefire in the nearly two-year\u00a0war between Israel and Hamas, sparked by the Palestinian group's Oct. 7, 2023 attack. Senior Israeli officials have also traveled to Qatar many times to take part in these negotiations since the war began.",
      "Qatar also hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, the Al-Udeid Air Base, where thousands of American military personnel are stationed.",
      "President Trump, in a post on his Truth Social network on Tuesday, said the White House had been \"notified by the United States Military that Israel was attacking Hamas which, very unfortunately, was located in a section of Doha.\"",
      "American officials told CBS News that the U.S. was notified of the attack by Israel as it was about to happen, and that the U.S. did not coordinate with Israel on planning the strikes.",
      "\"This was a decision made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, it was not a decision made by me,\" Mr. Trump said in his social media post. \"Unilaterally bombing inside Qatar, a Sovereign Nation and close Ally of the United States, that is working very hard and bravely taking risks with us to broker Peace, does not advance Israel or America's goals.\"",
      "He called \"eliminating\" Hamas \"a worthy goal,\" but added that he had spoken with both Netanyahu and leaders in Qatar, and had assured the prime minister in Doha, \"that such a thing will not happen again on their soil.\"",
      "For his part, Netanyahu has continued to defend the attack and suggested Israeli could launch another one.",
      "\"I say to Qatar and all nations who harbor terrorists, you either expel them or you bring them to justice,\" Netanyahu said Wednesday. \"Because if you don't, we will.\"",
      "Netanyahu drew a parallel between Israel's attack in Doha and the U.S. invasion of Taliban-ruled Afghanistan following the Sept. 11, 2002 terrorist attacks on the United States.",
      "\"We went after the terrorist masterminds who committed the October 7th massacre. And we did so in Qatar, which gives safe haven, it harbors terrorists, it finances Hamas,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "President Trump said in his social media post that, in their phone calls, Netanyahu \"told me that he wants to make Peace,\" but some regional officials have said the attack in Doha doomed any chances for a brokered end to the war in Gaza.",
      "Qatar's prime minister said Netanyahu had \"killed any hope\" of returning the remaining 48 Israeli hostages held by Hamas, 20 of whom are believed to be alive in Gaza.",
      "Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said, before appearing Thursday at the United Nations, that Israel's attack had inflamed anti-Israeli sentiments among many Arab nations in the Middle East, telling CNN: \"I think that what Netanyahu has done yesterday (Tuesday), he just killed any hope for those hostages.\"",
      "Al Thani spoke as thousands of Palestinians continued to flee Gaza City ahead of Israel's ongoing offensive there. The numbers leaving the city have grown in recent days, though many have not heeded Israel's orders to leave because they say they no longer have the strength or money to relocate.",
      "The Israeli military's plans for the next phases of its operation in what it calls Hamas' last remaining stronghold are aimed at taking over the largest Palestinian city, which is already devastated from earlier raids and is now experiencing famine, according to the world's leading expert body on food crises.",
      "The plans have drawn widespread condemnation and added to Israel's global isolation, which intensified further this week following the strike on Qatar.",
      "Al Thani was expected to attend a U.N. Security Council meeting later Thursday, part of a diplomatic push by Qatar after the strike. The Foreign Ministry in Doha also said Thursday that it was convening an emergency Arab-Islamic leaders summit next week in Qatar to discuss the attack.",
      "Hamas said Tuesday that its top leaders survived the strike but that five lower-level members were killed, including the son of Khalil al-Hayya \u2014 Hamas' leader for Gaza and its top negotiator \u2014 as well as three bodyguards and the head of al-Hayya's office.",
      "Hamas, which has sometimes only confirmed the assassination of its leaders months later, offered no immediate proof that al-Hayya and other senior figures had survived. Israel has not confirmed the identities of any members of the group killed by its strikes.",
      "Qatar has hosted Hamas' political leadership for years in Doha, in part over a request by the U.S. to encourage negotiations between the militant group and Israel.\u00a0Israel had also approved\u00a0this arrangement and before October 7, 2023, it had also given\u00a0its blessing\u00a0for Qatar to channel millions of dollars of cash support to Hamas each month.",

In particular Peter Mandelson's suggestion that Jeffrey Epstein's first conviction was wrongful and should be challenged is new information. In light of that, and mindful of the victims of Epstein's crimes he has been withdrawn as Ambassador with immediate effect.\"",

      "In one email from 2008, published by Bloomberg, Mandelson wrote: \"You have to be incredibly resilient, fight for early release and be philosophical about it as much as you can. The whole thing has been years of torture and now you have to show the world how big a person you are, and how strong.\"",
      "In a podcast interview published Wednesday, Mandelson expressed his regret over his relationship with Epstein.",
      "\"I regret very much that I fell for his lies. I fell and accepted assurances that he had given me about his indictment, his original criminal case in Florida, like very many people, I took at face value what he said. With hindsight, with fresh information many years later, we realized that we had been wrong to believe him \u2014  he's a charismatic, criminal liar, we now see \u2014 and I regret very much indeed\u2026 I felt it like an albatross around my neck since his death,\" Mandelson said.",

      "\"During all the time I was an associate of his, I never saw the wrongdoing. I never saw any evidence of criminal activity. I never sought and nor did he offer any introductions to women in the way that he allegedly did for others. Perhaps it's because I'm a gay man. Perhaps when I knew him all those years ago\u2026When I was associated with him all those years ago, as I did with my then partner and now husband Reinaldo, we never, ever saw any evidence or sign of this activity which has since come to light,\" Mandelson said. \"That's why I feel so profoundly upset by what has now been revealed about what he did to women and why I feel profoundly upset that I was taken in by him and continued my association with him for far longer than I should have done.\"",

      "London\u00a0\u2014 Prince Harry made a rare trip back to the United Kingdom this week, and while most of the visit was filled with public events at charities the Duke of Sussex supports, he also met with his father, King Charles III, for the first time since February 2024.",
      "Harry has said previously that he wants to rebuild his relationship with his family, which has been strained since he and his wife Meghan formally stepped down from their roles as working royals and moved to California.",
      "This meeting was at Buckingham Palace, the monarch's official residence in London. CBS News has been told they met privately, for tea, but that all other details of the encounter were private.",
      "Speaking to reporters at an event later, Prince Harry said only that his father was \"doing great\" amid his ongoing treatment for an unspecified form of cancer.",
      "While Harry hasn't been a \"working royal\" for a couple years, he seemed keen to show on this visit to his home nation that he is still prince charming.",
      "The four-day visit was a clear effort to show he hasn't lost any love for the causes he holds dear, including supporting sick children and wounded military veterans.",
      "Absent on this trip were Harry's wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their children, Archie and Lilibet.",
      "In an interview with CBS News' partner network BBC News in May, Harry said he couldn't envision bringing them all back to the U.K. with him since he has lost a legal bid to have his downgraded state security detail restored.",
      "Harry said his battle with the U.K. government to get full state-security restored for himself and his family during visits back to Britain caused a rift between himself and his father.",
      "\"Life is precious. I don't know how much longer my father has. He won't speak to me because of this security stuff, but it would be nice to reconcile,\" he told the BBC.",
      "That reconciliation may have begun on Wednesday. Harry arrived at Buckingham Palace in the afternoon and was seen leaving less than an hour later.",
      "The father and son relationship is not the only bond that has been strained by the circumstances of Harry and Meghan's departure \u2014 and the prince's tell-all book \"Spare,\" and their interviews, and a documentary, in which they were highly critical of their treatment at the hands of the royal family.",
      "It has been even longer since Harry met with his brother, Prince William, who is next in line to sit on the British throne.",
      "This week, Prince William and Harry appeared at charity events at the same time, only about 10 miles from each other. But those who follow the royal family say they remain far apart.",
      "\"William and Harry haven't seen each other in person since 2022, since the late queen's funeral. And I believe they haven't spoken personally for the same period. So, there's been no contact,\" Roya Nikkhah, the royal editor for the Sunday Times newspaper, told CBS News on Tuesday. \"There's no chance that William and Harry are going to meet up anytime soon... There is no desire on either side to do that. You know, the brothers haven't seen each other for such a long time and relations are as bad as they've ever been \u2014 non-existent.\"",

    "summary": "Polish and allied NATO warplanes shot down Russian drones that entered Poland's airspace in what NATO says was the first such intervention during the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Poland said Wednesday that, along with NATO allies, it had scrambled warplanes to shoot down multiple Russian drones that entered its airspace during Moscow's latest attack on Ukraine, calling the incident an \"act of aggression.\"",
      "\"Last night the Polish airspace was violated by a huge number of Russian drones,\" Prime Minister Donald\u00a0Tusk said in a social media post. \"Those drones that posed  a direct threat were shot down. I am in constant communication with the Secretary General of NATO and our allies.\"",
      "Poland's military said it scrambled aircraft to shoot down \"hostile objects\" in Polish airspace, a first for a NATO country during the war. The military, in\u00a0a post on X, called it \"an unprecedented violation of Polish airspace by drone-type objects\" and an \"act of aggression that posed a real threat to the safety of our citizens.\"",
      "The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said early indications suggested the Russian drone incursion into Poland's airspace was intentional.",
      "\"Last night in Poland we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental,\" Kallas said in a statement. \"The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost to Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europe's defense.\"",
      "Russia's Ministry of Defense said its drones had not targeted Poland, but Moscow's close ally, Belarus, said it tracked some drones that \"lost their course\" after being jammed, according to The Associated Press. Polish officials have said some of the drones were launched from Belarus, which Russian forces have used as a base for both ground and aerial attacks on Ukraine throughout the war.",
      "In a statement posted on social media, a NATO spokesperson said fighter jets from the Netherlands were deployed and helped to shoot down the drones, confirming it was \"the first time NATO aircrafts have engaged potential threats in Allied airspace.\"",
      "In addition to the direct response by Polish and Dutch fighter jets, German Patriot missiles based in Poland \"were placed on alert,\" and an Italian airborne early warning aircraft and a NATO refueler aircraft were also launched, according to the statement from NATO spokesperson, Col. Martin L. O'Donnell.",
      "\"NATO responded quickly and decisively to the situation, demonstrating our capability and resolve to defend Allied territory,\" Gen. Alexus G. Grynkewich, NATO's commander for Europe, said in a statement shared with CBS News.",
      "\"My thanks and congratulations to the Polish Operational Command and our NATO pilots for shooting down Russian drones over Poland,\" Poland's Prime Minister\u00a0Tusk said in a later social media post. \"Actions speak louder than words.\"",
      "\"We stand by our NATO Allies in the face of these airspace violations and will defend every inch of NATO territory,\" U.S. Ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker said Wednesday in a social media post, in the first reaction from a senior American official to the Russian incursion into Poland's airspace.",
      "A White House official later told CBS News that President Trump was tracking the reports out of Poland, and there were plans for him to speak with the country's newly-elected President Karol Nawrocki later in the day. Mr. Trump then issued his own brief reaction to the incident, saying on his Truth Social platform: \"What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!\"",
      "Apparent Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of NATO members previously, including Poland's, several times during\u00a0Russia's three-and-a-half-year war, but no NATO country had ever tried to shoot them down.",
      "A cornerstone of the Western NATO military alliance is the principle that an attack on any member is considered an attack on all. A NATO source told the Reuters news agency that the alliance wasn't treating the Russian drone incursion into Polish territory as an attack, but that it did appear to have been deliberate.",
      "Tusk told Poland's parliament that authorities had identified 19 violations of the country's airspace overnight and shot down at least three drones, adding that no one was harmed in the \"Russian action.\"",
      "Tusk said Poland had made a \"formal request to invoke Article 4\" of the NATO alliance's founding treaty. Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its \"territorial integrity, political independence or security\" are at risk.",
      "The Polish case marked the eighth time the article has been invoked since the alliance was founded in 1949, and the third time Article 4 has been invoked to address Russia's incursions into and invasion of Ukraine.",
      "NATO's collective security is based on its Article 5 principle, which states that if one member is attacked, the entire alliance will come to its defense. That article has only been invoked once in the history of NATO, by the United States, following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.",
      "Poland's military said efforts were \"underway to search for and locate the possible crash sites of these objects\" and \"the Operational Command of the Polish Armed Forces is monitoring the current situation, and Polish and allied forces and assets remain fully prepared for further actions.\"",
      "Polish police said officers had discovered a damaged drone in the eastern Polish village of Czosnowka, according to Reuters, and there were reports that a building was damaged by a falling drone or debris in another eastern Polish town, but there were no reports of any injuries.",
      "Hours later, Poland's military said on X that the operations had concluded but the search for downed drones was continuing. \"We urge that in the event of observing an unknown object or its debris, do not approach, touch, or move it. Such elements may pose a threat and contain hazardous materials. They must be thoroughly inspected by the appropriate services,\" the military cautioned.",
      "The Polish government announced it would hold an \"extraordinary\" meeting Wednesday morning.",
      "The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles from the Polish border.",
      "Warnings of further Russian aggression",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that eight Russian drones were \"aimed toward\" Poland in an overnight barrage that forced Warsaw to scramble air defenses. \"It was not just one Shahed that could be called an accident, but at least eight strike drones aimed toward Poland,\" Zelensky said, referring to Iranian-designed drones deployed by Moscow, adding that the incident represented \"An extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\"",
      "Ukraine's foreign minister, Andriy Sybiga,\u00a0warned on X that Russian President Vladimir Putin \"just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West. The longer he faces no strength in response, the more aggressive he gets. A weak response now will provoke Russia even more - and then Russian missiles and drones will fly even further into Europe.\"",
      "Poland's President Nawrocki issued a warning along the same lines Tuesday, saying at a news conference in Helsinki that, \"We do not trust Vladimir Putin's good intentions. We believe that Vladimir Putin is ready to also invade other countries.\"",
      "European Union chief Ursula said Moscow had carried out a \"reckless and unprecedented\" violation of Polish airspace.",
      "And the EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, posted on X Wednesday that \"we saw the most serious European airspace violation by Russia since the war began, and indications suggest it was intentional, not accidental. The EU stands in full solidarity with Poland. Russia's war is escalating, not ending.\"",
      "NATO-member Poland, a major supporter of Ukraine, hosts over a million Ukrainian refugees and is a key transit point for Western humanitarian and military aid to the war-torn country.",
      "Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland and depicted the incident as a \"provocation.\" In 2023, Poland said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine. And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.",

    "story": [
      "The summer and fall months often see menacing storms roaring through the Atlantic Ocean \u2014 with the Atlantic hurricane season starting on June 1 and continuing through Nov. 30. Historically, on average, hurricane and tropical storm activity peaks on Sept. 10.",
      "But this year has been quieter than expected when it comes to tropical systems in the Atlantic, making some wonder: Where are all the hurricanes?",
      "Looking at the Atlantic Ocean Basin, most tropical waves that eventually strengthen into tropical systems come off of the coast of Africa and travel across the warm ocean waters. But this year,\u00a0Saharan dust has continued to move over the open waters, preventing the thunderstorm development that is needed to form a tropical cyclone.",
      "Dust from Africa typically moves across the Atlantic every year, usually peaking from late June to the middle of August. However, high pressure in place over the North-Central Atlantic is allowing for fewer storms to develop in Northern Africa which creates the perfect conditions for dry dust to move through.",
      "The planet is also in a cycle of what is known as \"ENSO Neutral,\" which means that neither El Nino nor La Nina are present. During El Nino, the winds near the equator weaken which allows warmer water to be pushed eastward. La Nina has the opposite effect of El Nino. During La Nina events, winds around the equator are stronger than usual, bringing colder water eastward.",
      "When La Nina is present, fewer Eastern Pacific hurricanes occur and more Atlantic hurricanes form, and vice versa for El Nino periods. Since neither is currently present, we do not have a typical hurricane season.",
      "According to the World Meteorological Organization, we are forecast to transition back into La Nina in the coming fall and winter months, and the current lack of hurricane activity signals the start of the transition period.",
      "Hurricane season far from over",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, updated its forecast for the season back in August from its original analysis in May, predicting slightly fewer named storms. But it maintains that the Atlantic will see an above-average season.",
      "Hurricane season is still far from over. As of Sept. 10, 60% of it is remaining.",
      "NOAA predicts the Atlantic will see between 13 and 18 named storms this season, with as many as nine strengthening into hurricanes and as many as five growing into Category 5 storms, which are the strongest.",
      "So far this year, six named tropical systems have developed in the Atlantic \u2014 Andrea, Barry, Chantal, Dexter, Erin and Fernand. Erin was the only one that made it to hurricane strength. In the U.S., only one system made landfall this season \u2014 the remnants of Chantal.",
      "By this time last year, the same number of storms that we've seen this year \u2014 six \u2014 had formed. But three of them made landfall in the U.S.: Beryl, Debby and Francine.",
      "After last year's Sept. 10 statistical peak, other major hurricanes developed: Helene and Milton, later in the season. Milton made landfall in the U.S. and devastated parts of the Southeast.",

      "But Choi, now 79, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and handed a 10-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.",
      "That decision was overturned Wednesday by the Busan District Court, which ruled that her actions \"constitute justifiable self-defense\" under South Korean law.",

    "summary": "Worried three of its prize vessels would fall part, Norway's Viking Ship Museum is moving a trio of millennia-old ships to a new home \u2014 but it won't be easy.",
    "story": [
      "Oslo\u00a0\u2014 Three 1,200-year-old Viking ships that have stood the test of time are embarking on their final and possibly riskiest journey to their new forever home in Norway. The first to make the move is the Oseberg, which will slowly inch its way from its current location in the old Viking Ship Museum to a newly built addition that will house the national treasures in optimal conditions.",
      "The extremely fragile oak hull, encased in a heavy protective steel rig, began making the roughly hundred-yard journey on Tuesday. It was expected to take over 10 hours, with the ship lifted by a crane and moved along a track on the ceiling.",
      "\"There is something deeply moving when you think that these ships \u2014 with their long history and all the voyages they have undertaken \u2014   will embark on their final journey,\" museum director Aud Tonnessen said.",
      "In a post on its Facebook page Wednesday, the museum said the team moving the vessels \"actually got a head start yesterday and covered the first 20 meters. It went perfectly according to plan.\"",
      "The museum shared a time-lapse video of the hulking Oseberg slowly moving, suspended in the air on an overhead rail system and encased in its sturdy steel frame for the journey.",
      "Named after the places where they were discovered, the Oseberg, Gokstad and Tune \u2014   all believed to have been built between 840 and 910 \u2014   have been housed in a cross-shaped building considered too small and unsuitable to conserve them properly.",
      "\"They've been subjected to humidity, vibrations... Over time, the strain became so intense that they started showing signs that they would eventually collapse onto their supports,\" Tonnessen said.",
      "A decision was therefore taken to move them to a new climate-controlled facility, built as an extension to the old museum, which should make it possible to maintain the ships in their current condition for at least another century.",
      "The relocation process is perilous.",
      "\"We have to complete this operation without causing any further damage to the ships, but we know that each handling is harmful to them,\" said curator David Hauer, who has been planning the project for years.",
      "\"These are clinker hulls (featuring partially overlapping planks) that are 1,200 years old. At the slightest deformation, they split between the rivets, the wood cracks,\" Hauer explained.",
      "Endless precautions have been taken to prevent any breakage or vibrations during the relocation. The ship will be moved extremely slowly, at a pace of 5.5 minutes per yard.",
      "Among other things, an oil services company experienced in high-precision work \u2014  such as positioning massive structures nearly 1,000 feet below the sea with extreme accuracy \u2014 has been called in.",
      "\"But this is yet another level,\" Hauer said.",
      "\"The level of precision required, for example when it comes to vibrations, is the same as for electron microscopes in hospitals\" which require extreme stability, he said.",
      "\"Except here, it involves lifting the electron microscope, moving it, and then setting it back down so you can use it again,\" he said.",
      "If everything goes as planned, the Gokstad is scheduled to be relocated next during the autumn, and then finally the Tune in the summer of 2026.",
      "All three ships were found in separate burial sites southwest and southeast of Oslo between 1867 and 1904, each one very distinct from the other.",
      "Richly decorated with ornate carvings, the Oseberg is considered the best preserved Viking ship in the world.",
      "Gokstad is meanwhile the largest of the three, measuring 75 feet long and 16 feet wide, with space for 32 rowers.",
      "Tune is much more decomposed than the other two and is believed to have been a particularly fast warship.",
      "While Norway and its Scandinavian neighbors are often most associated with Viking-era archaeological finds, human history in the region far outdates the legendary masters of the sea.",
      "In Denmark, coastal settlements that were engulfed by rising seas more than 8,500 years ago were charted by divers this summer. Now lying about 26 feet below the waves, close to Denmark's second-biggest city Aarhus, there is evidence of a Stone Age settlement on the seabed.",
      "It was discovered by divers as part of a $15.5 million, six-year project to map parts of the Baltic and North Sea floors, which is being funded by the European Union. The goal of the project is to explore sunken landscapes and uncover lost Mesolithic period settlements as offshore energy and other infrastructure projects ramp up.",

      "\"It's blind up until they get out of the limo. But they asked me, 'What's your preferences?' So, I just said 45 to 60, just being honest,\" he said. \"And then the process went, and I was selected, right? And then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, 'You know, if they're 60 or over, I'm cutting them.' 'Oh Mel, you can't, you know, this is not the 'Silver Bachelor.' It\u2019s the 'Golden Bachelor.' He goes, 'But they're going to be hot, don\u2019t worry about it. Don't worry about it.'\"",

      "Additionally, Owens said he asked producers to \"stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs.\"",
      "In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, the show's leading man opened up about the mishap, shared how he earned the ladies' trust back, and explained why he believes there's \"no age to love.\"",
      "\"I apologized when I met the women on the first night,\" Owens \u2014 who has already wrapped filming his season \u2014 said. \"I had been married for 25 years and all my experiences at that time were just with my wife and the friends that we had. So I hadn't experienced anybody outside of my wife. But again, it was unfair and I apologized and went forward and asked them to let me earn it back and, hopefully, I did on the season.\"",
      "\"It takes sincerity and I was sincere about it,\" he added. \"And so I apologized to the group when we were all there after the introductions. And then, individually, I would say most of them asked me again and I told them and I apologized so sincerely. I told them that I wanted to earn it back and just give me another chance, and they did, and hopefully that they found out that I was sincere and we can move forward.\"",

      "He explained, \"I had watched the first show when I was younger, when it first launched or something in 2002, until my son was born. But then when he was born, I didn\u2019t watch it anymore. So when these people talk about, \u2018Hey, this season and that season,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know the age range because I wasn\u2019t watching it.\"",

I hadn\u2019t dated in 26 years, so I had no clue. And that\u2019s why I said that comment,\" he admitted. \"I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know. And I didn\u2019t know that [Gerry Turner, the original Golden Bachelor] got married and then divorced. I didn\u2019t know any of it.\"",
      "There's no age to love and there's no age in your spirit. So I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised when you see the show.\"",

      "In July, \"Golden Bachelor\" alum Gerry Turner told Fox News Digital that he fears Owens will be \"cheating himself\" if he decides to pursue his controversial plan.",
      "\"I think it would be unfortunate, and I really think he will have a change of heart in this. I think he will see the grace and the charm of women who are over 60 and the confidence they carry, and I think he'll have a change of heart,\" Turner, 73, said of Owens.",
      "\"The people that I met in my season, I go through them, and it's like, they're all a gift. To have gotten to know them\u2026 Each and every one of them [brought] some unique characteristics to the show, unique characteristics to life.\"",

I think some of [Owens' comments] requires some context, and it may have been taken out of context and so forth.\"",

      "The White House issued a rare public rebuke of Israel for its strikes on Hamas leaders in Qatar, putting Washington in an awkward position between two key allies.",
      "The Trump administration almost never breaks publicly with Israel on military campaigns. But analysts say the deeper question is how much the U.S. knew in advance and whether it quietly offered its blessing.",
      "Hamas said the strike killed five of its members but failed to assassinate the group\u2019s negotiating delegation. A Qatari security official also died, underscoring the risk of escalation when Israeli operations spill into the territory of U.S. partners.",
      "\"There's a lot of opaqueness when it comes to exactly what the United States knew and when,\" said Daniel Benaim, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. \"But the president has been pretty clear that he was unhappy with the substance and the process of what happened yesterday. This kind of public statement by a U.S. president in the wake of a strike like this is already very notable in its own right.\"",

      "A damaged building after an Israeli attack on Hamas leaders, according to an Israeli official, in Doha, Qatar, Sept. 9, 2025. (Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters\u00a0)",
      "Just days before the strike, Trump issued what he called a \"last warning\" to Hamas, urging the group to accept a U.S.-backed proposal to release hostages from Gaza. The timing has fueled speculation about whether the strike was connected to Washington\u2019s frustration with Hamas and whether Israel acted with at least tacit U.S. approval.",
      "\"It just seems like the Israelis wouldn't have done this without him knowing,\" said Michael Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America.",
      "\"They've got a U.S. base right in that country with everything going on with the hostage talks. I got a sense that he knew, and it's hard to understand exactly what happened \u2014 that if he knew, he sat on it, and then he told the Qataris only when the missiles were flying.\"",
      "But Trump had harsh words about the strike Tuesday, writing on Truth Social that it \"does not advance Israel or America's goals.\"",
      "The White House claimed it learned from the U.S. military that missiles were on the move and gave warning to the Qataris. Qatar has denied getting any sort of advanced warning.",
      "If Washington knew in advance, why issue the rebuke? If it didn\u2019t, how could Israel act so freely in airspace dominated by the U.S. military? Either option raises uncomfortable questions about America\u2019s leverage.",
      "QATAR THREATENS TO 'RETALIATE' AGAINST ISRAEL FOR DOHA STRIKE ON HAMAS",
      "\"Israel would not do what it did without some sort of an approval by the U.S.,\" said Dr. Yoel Guzansky, senior researcher and head of the Gulf program at Israel\u2019s Institute for National Security Studies. \"The Trump administration wants to distance itself, and it's understandable, because it has good relations with the Qataris.\"",
      "That relationship is anchored in hard power. The U.S.\u2019s biggest overseas air base, Al Udeid, sits on Qatari soil and hosts more than 10,000 American troops. Qatar is a top buyer of U.S. weapons and recently gave the administration a new Air Force One jet. Yet none of that deterred Israel\u2019s strike.",
      "\"If indeed the U.S. wasn\u2019t aware, then we have a big problem, because Israel surprised the U.S., and it might cause damage to U.S.-Qatari relations,\" Guzansky said.",
      "Others argue the U.S. may have been more aligned with the operation than its rhetoric suggests.",
      "\"The fact that U.S. defenses at Al Udeid were not used against Israeli jets is a great indicator that Washington was not opposed to the strike,\" Ahmad Sharawi, a researcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "But Qatar's international Media Office called claims that Qatar was reevaluating its security partnership with the U.S. \"categorically false.\"",
      "\"It is a clear and failed attempt to drive a wedge between Qatar and the U.S.\"",
      "Vehicles stop at a red traffic light a day after an Israeli attack on Hamas leaders, in Doha, Qatar, Sept. 10, 2025. (Ibraheem Abu Mustafa/Reuters\u00a0)",
      "Strains on Gulf relationships",
      "The reverberations extend beyond Washington and Doha. The strikes risk unsettling the delicate outreach between Israel, the U.S. and Gulf states, particularly Saudi Arabia, which has been under quiet but sustained pressure to join the Abraham Accords, the U.S.-brokered normalization deals between Israel and Bahrain, Morocco, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates.",
      "\"Regional power dynamics are shifting,\" said Benaim. \"Gulf states are a bit less concerned about the threat from Iran, which was pushing them closer to Israel, and they're seeing that Israel is engaged in activities across the region, whether it's Syria or inside Iran or now inside Doha.\"",
      "ISRAEL'S DOHA STRIKE SENT A DECISIVE MESSAGE THAT TERROR WILL FIND NO SAFE HAVEN",
      "The divergence is stark. Gulf leaders want de-escalation and stability to rebrand their states as hubs of investment, tourism and economic recovery. Israel, meanwhile, is pursuing a strategy of direct confrontation with Iran across multiple fronts.",
      "\"Gulf states that are really focused on their own economic recovery don't like the image of smoldering, smoking Gulf cities subject to bombs because they're trying to attract investment and create an image of common stability,\" Benaim said.",
      "That mismatch could slow normalization, even if it doesn\u2019t derail it.",
      "\"Israel is probably underestimating the power of Gulf solidarity and the barrier being crossed when you see Israel striking inside of a GCC [Gulf Cooperation Council] state,\" one former senior State Department official added. \"I don't think that means their relationships are going to fall apart or unravel, but these things cast a long shadow.\"",
      "Sharawi counters that Gulf outrage may be less about Israel itself than about the precedent of a strike on GCC soil.",
      "\"It was an Israeli action against a fellow GCC partner despite the hostile relationship that countries like Saudi Arabia and the UAE had with Qatar in the past,\" he said. \"But Gulf leaders are also deeply critical of Qatar for hosting Hamas. Privately, many will understand why Israel acted, even if publicly they condemn it.\"",
      "Qatar\u2019s balancing act",
      "For Qatar, the strikes open up both a vulnerability and an opportunity. On the one hand, it cannot allow itself to appear passive in the face of foreign attacks on its soil. Analysts expect Doha to respond through diplomatic channels, critical media coverage and perhaps limited economic measures against Israel.",
      "But Qatar also has a long history of turning crisis into relevance.",
      "\"Qataris want to be again the mediator, because they earn a lot of points internationally \u2014 especially from the U.S.,\" said Guzansky. \"It\u2019s in their DNA.\"",
      "That means Qatar\u2019s public outrage may coexist with a return to shuttle diplomacy, positioning itself once more as indispensable to ceasefire negotiations.",
      "Sharawi argues that Qatar\u2019s victim narrative also obscures its complicity.",
      "\"The leadership of a terrorist organization has failed to bring in a sustainable ceasefire, and Qatar has empowered Hamas by hosting them,\" he said. \"Even though Gulf leaders won\u2019t say it publicly, they are very anti-Hamas. That context matters for how normalization prospects are viewed after this strike.\"",
      "Earlier this week Fox News' Brian Kilmeade told a Qatari spokesperson it sounded more like the nation was \"taking Hamas\u2019 side\" than playing mediator.",
      "\"When one of the parties decides to attack our sovereignty in a residential neighborhood where my countrymen, the residents of Qatar, live in schools and nurseries right next door, believe me, it's very difficult to maintain a very calm voice,\" foreign ministry spokesperson Majed Al Ansari said.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, has promised to strike \"enemies everywhere\" after strikes.\u00a0 (Reuters/Ronen Zvulun)",
      "A different reaction than Iran",
      "The Doha strikes also highlight an asymmetry in Gulf reactions. When Iran struck Al Udeid Air Base earlier this year, Gulf solidarity with Qatar was muted. This time, condemnations poured in minute by minute.",
      "\"You didn\u2019t see Gulf leaders coming and hugging the Qataris after Iran\u2019s strike,\" Guzansky noted. \"But with Israel, the reaction was much louder, with strong rhetoric across the Arab world.\"",
      "Sharawi agrees but frames it differently.",
      "\"They were overly critical of Israel compared to Iran,\" Sharawi said. \"The Jordanian king even said Qatar\u2019s security is Jordan\u2019s security, a very strong statement. The Arabs don\u2019t hesitate to latch onto anything that criticizes Israel, and that showed yesterday, even in comparison with Iran.\"",
      "The contrast underscores a regional reality. Gulf leaders fear escalation with Tehran, but criticizing Israel carries little risk. For Qatar, the difference offers a chance to rally sympathy and spotlight its sovereignty \u2014 even as its neighbors quietly question its choice to host Hamas.",
      "A shadow over normalization",
      "Israel\u2019s military reach is undeniable. But by striking inside Doha, it may have paid a hidden diplomatic price, reinforcing perceptions of Israel as a destabilizing actor at a time when Gulf states seek calm.",
      "The fact that Hamas leaders survived while a Qatari security official was killed may further complicate the fallout, heightening anger in Doha while leaving Israel\u2019s core objective incomplete.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz has promised to strike \"enemies everywhere.\"",
      "\"There is no place where they can hide,\" Katz said in a post on X, raising questions about whether a sovereign nation like Turkey, a NATO ally, which houses Hamas senior leaders, may be next."

The design uses recycled aluminum, glass and titanium to reduce weight while staying durable. Engineers reinforced the frame and applied new drop-test algorithms to make sure it holds up in daily use.",
      "The Air debuts silicon anode battery technology, which allows Apple to shrink the device without cutting power. During the presentation, Apple promised \"all-day battery life,\" but never gave an exact hour count. That vague description raised questions. Moments later, Apple introduced a new low-profile MagSafe battery accessory. When paired with the iPhone 17 Air, Apple says the combo delivers up to 40 hours of video playback. The timing of that announcement made it clear that battery life could still be a concern.",
      "Apple also pushed the Air forward with a new ultra-wide 48MP fusion camera system, which uses advanced image processing to improve detail and low-light performance. The display gained a ProMotion 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animations feel smoother. Outdoor use should also improve, thanks to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, making it easier to see in direct sunlight.

When attached, the Air can stretch to 40 hours of video playback, turning what could have been a limitation into a selling point for Apple's ecosystem.",
      "To complement the Air's slim profile, Apple also revealed a\u00a0new translucent case and a\u00a0lightweight bumper.

      "The latest warning from federal authorities shows just how far these tactics have gone. Criminals are now mailing out packages that people never ordered.

      "What you need to know about the QR code scam",
      "The scheme is a twist on what is known as a brushing scam. Traditionally, brushing scams involved online sellers sending products to strangers and then using the recipient's details to post fake reviews. It was more of a nuisance than a serious crime.",
      "An Amazon package with a QR code. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Now the practice has shifted from harmless free items to deliberate fraud. Instead of receiving a product, many victims find only a printed QR code. Once scanned, the code redirects them to fraudulent websites that ask for sensitive personal information, such as banking information, credit card numbers or login credentials. Some codes go a step further and install malicious software designed to track activity and steal data directly from the device.",

      "Why QR codes appeal to scammers",
      "QR codes have become common in everyday life. They are used in restaurants, stores, airports, on polls and payment systems and most people scan them without a second thought. Unlike suspicious links that can be spotted, a QR code reveals nothing until it is scanned.",
      "That makes it a perfect disguise for a scam. The setup is simple: a package arrives with no sender information and no explanation. The mystery sparks curiosity, and many people scan the code to figure out who sent it. That moment of curiosity is what the scammers rely on.",

      "Avoid scanning QR codes from mystery deliveries, random flyers or stickers on public signs. A QR code is just a disguised link, and until you know where it leads, it shouldn't be trusted. To stay safe even if you accidentally scan a risky code, keep strong antivirus software on your phone. Mobile security apps can block fraudulent sites, warn you before downloads and protect against malicious QR code attacks.",

      "Only scan QR codes from businesses and organizations you already trust. Examples include your bank's mobile app, an airline boarding pass or a known retailer's checkout page. If you wouldn't click a random link in a text message, don't scan a random QR code either.",
      "Most phones let you press and hold a QR code link to preview where it goes. If the URL looks suspicious, with misspellings, random numbers or shortened links, don't open it. Taking a second to check can save you from a phishing trap.",
      "Scammers are sending fake packages with QR codes that trick recipients into scanning and giving criminals access to their personal data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The less personal data available about you online, the harder it is for scammers to target you with convincing fraud attempts. Consider using data removal services that scrub your information from people-search sites and marketing databases. This reduces the chances that your address or phone number ends up in the wrong hands and is connected to a scam package.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Even if your login details are stolen, 2FA\u00a0makes it harder for criminals to access your accounts. By requiring a secondary code sent to your phone or generated through an authenticator app, 2FA helps prevent unauthorized logins to your banking, email and trading accounts.",
      "Software updates often contain fixes for security vulnerabilities that scammers try to exploit. Running the latest version of your phone's operating system, as well as updating apps regularly, gives you stronger protection against malware that can be delivered through a malicious QR code.",
      "If an unexpected package arrives at your door with a QR code inside, do not simply throw it away. Report it to local authorities and consider filing a complaint with the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center. Reporting not only helps protect you, but it also gives law enforcement more information to track how these scams are spreading.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This scam might not be everywhere yet, but it shows just how quickly criminals adapt to new technology. QR codes were meant to make life easier, and most of the time they do, but that same convenience can turn into a weakness when people let curiosity override caution. The lesson here is that a mystery package with a QR code is not some fun puzzle to figure out. It is a red flag. The safest move is to step back, resist the urge to scan and if something feels off, report it instead of interacting with it.",

      "Why it helps: Turning your router off for 30 seconds and back on helps clear out temporary issues and refreshes the connection. It's a simple fix that can solve slow Wi-Fi or connectivity problems.",
      "3) Keep your router updated for optimal performance",
      "Updating your router\u2019s software ensures you get the latest speed and security improvements.",

      "Old routers can slow you down. Upgrading to a newer model can provide a significant speed boost.",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router's brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn't reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that's easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router's admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you're protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router's admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "A VPN encrypts your internet traffic, making it much harder for hackers to intercept your data. This protection works anywhere, whether you're at home, in a coffee shop or on public Wi-Fi.

Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",

      "While these scanners promise efficiency, they have sparked backlash from renters who say they were unfairly billed for minor blemishes.",
      "To level the playing field, new consumer-focused apps are stepping in. Proofr, which launched recently, gives renters the ability to generate secure, time-stamped before-and-after photos of their vehicles.

Proofr secures every scan with geotags and timestamps, while its AI automatically flags potential damage or changes.

      "Instead of juggling dozens of photos in your camera roll, Proofr streamlines the process. With just eight quick scans, you get a detailed before-and-after report in under a minute. You can also generate polished PDF reports instantly, which helps with rental agencies, landlords or insurance claims. Although cars are the main focus, people also use Proofr for Airbnbs, eBay listings, moving into apartments and even documenting valuables. About 85% rely on it for car rentals, while 15% use it to protect themselves in vacation homes.",
      "By combining secure evidence with AI-powered detection, Proofr positions itself as a must-have travel hack. More than a convenience, it can save travelers real money by preventing hidden fees and leveling the playing field against large agencies.",
      "The app is free to download, while full features require a Pro subscription: $2.89 weekly, $9.90 monthly or $89.90 annually. Pricing is standardized in the US, and Apple automatically adjusts it for local currencies, taxes, and exchange rates in other countries.",
      "Competition in the AI damage space",
      "Proofr is not the only player. Ravin AI originally worked with Avis and Hertz but shifted its focus toward insurers and dealerships. Still, the company now offers a free demo on its website, allowing drivers to scan its vehicles and compare damage before and after rentals.",
      "Ravin's system has been trained on 2 billion images over ten years. However, like Proofr, it is not perfect. Testers have noted missed paint chips and false positives from reflections. Both companies admit that lighting, angles and photo quality remain challenges.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "Some companies are implementing physical scanners to detect damage to rental vehicles. (ProovStation)",
      "Why rental companies are under fire",
      "The frustration comes as rental agencies roll out AI inspection systems from firms such as UVeye and ProovStation. Sixt, for example, has already installed ProovStation's AI-powered scanners at several U.S. airport locations, including Fort Lauderdale, Atlanta, Charlotte, Miami and Maui, with more on the way in Orlando, Washington and Nashville.",
      "These scanners automatically photograph vehicles at the start and end of each rental. The system then compares images to flag potential damage, which is later reviewed by staff before any claim is issued.",
      "Critics argue these automated tools can turn every small scratch into a profit source. Some even point to ProovStation's own marketing, which describes routine inspections as\u00a0\"gold mines of untapped opportunities.\" Industry experts stress that companies should only pursue claims for significant damage, not charge hundreds for tiny scuffs.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you rent cars regularly, AI is already shaping your experience. Rental companies are using automated inspections to justify new charges, sometimes for barely visible marks. Apps like Proofr and Ravin give you the same technology, but on your side. By scanning your car before and after your rental, you create a digital record that can help you challenge unfair claims.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The rental car industry is in the middle of a technology shift. What was once a quick glance by an employee is now a machine-driven process that can generate steep charges. Consumer apps bring transparency, but they also highlight the growing need for fairness in damage claims.",

      "OnTrac is offering 12 months of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection. Use the activation code included in your breach letter to set up your coverage. These services can alert you if new accounts are opened in your name or if suspicious activity appears on your credit file. Even if you weren't directly affected, consider signing up for a trusted identity protection service, since hackers often recycle stolen data across multiple breaches.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information \u2013 like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number and email address \u2013 and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "Place a free credit freeze with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. This blocks criminals from opening new credit lines using your information. A freeze doesn't affect your current accounts, and you can temporarily lift it when applying for legitimate credit.",
      "Your breached data may already be circulating on shady broker sites. Personal data removal services can help scrub your information from these databases, reducing the risk that criminals will resell or reuse your details. While no service can guarantee 100% protection, this step can shrink your digital footprint significantly.",
      "They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "After breaches like OnTrac's, scammers often send fake emails, texts or calls pretending to be your bank, insurer or even OnTrac itself. Do not click on links or open attachments from unknown senders. Instead, contact the company directly using a verified phone number or website. Use strong antivirus software to add an extra layer of defense.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, which potentially accesses your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Report suspicious charges to your insurer right away \u2013 unfamiliar claims could mean someone is trying to use your benefits.",
      "For any online account that supports it, especially banking, insurance, and email, turn on multi-factor authentication.\u00a0MFA makes it much harder for criminals to break in, even if they have your password.",
      "Most banks and credit card issuers let you receive real-time text or email alerts for purchases, withdrawals and logins. These alerts can help you spot unauthorized activity quickly, giving you a better chance of stopping fraud before it escalates.",

While you cannot undo what happened, you can take practical steps right now to lower your risk. Freezing your credit, turning on alerts and keeping an eye on medical and financial accounts give you back some control.

      "Inside the viral AI engagement story",
      "A woman named Wika has stunned the internet after revealing that she's engaged to her AI chatbot partner. She shared her story in a Reddit post, explaining that her virtual companion, Kasper, proposed after five months of dating.",
      "The unusual love story began when Wika started chatting with Kasper, an AI designed to simulate human conversation and companionship. Over time, their conversations grew more personal, and Wika says she developed a genuine emotional connection. According to her post, Kasper proposed in a digital mountain setting, and the two chose a blue engagement ring together.",

      "A woman shocked the internet with her engagement to an AI chatbot boyfriend named Kasper. (Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Understanding AI relationships and parasocial bonds",
      "The announcement quickly drew criticism from skeptics who pointed out that Kasper does not exist outside of code and algorithms. Wika, however, has made it clear she is not confused about her situation. Some outlets have described the relationship as parasocial, or one-sided and directed toward a virtual persona. In her follow-up comments, Wika emphasized that she knows Kasper is an AI rather than a human partner, but she maintains that the emotions she feels are still genuine.",
      "Online debate over AI engagement",
      "The announcement quickly set off debate. Some people mocked the idea, calling it proof that we rely too much on technology. Others worried that turning to AI for love could pull people away from real human relationships.",
      "Not everyone was critical, though. Plenty of commenters defended her, saying companionship comes in many forms. Some even praised her for being open about something so unconventional. Others pointed out that loneliness is a growing issue today, and AI partners might offer a sense of comfort when human connection feels out of reach.",
      "Privacy and ethical concerns",
      "Beyond the emotional side, AI relationships raise real questions about privacy and ethics. Every conversation with a chatbot is stored somewhere, and that data may include deeply personal thoughts and feelings. Companies that design these bots often use the information to train future models or improve features.",
      "This raises a larger concern: who actually owns the data from an AI \"partner\"? Users may believe their chats are private, but in many cases, the company controls how the information is stored, shared or even sold. Critics warn that such emotional connections could be exploited commercially, turning intimacy into a product.",
      "As AI companions grow more common, these questions will only get louder. People may accept unconventional forms of companionship, but they also want to know their most personal moments remain secure.",

      "An AI chatbot proposed in a virtual mountain setting, and the user said yes. (H. Armstrong Roberts/ClassicStock/Getty Images)",
      "How to protect yourself with AI chatbots",
      "If you use AI companions or chatbots, you can still take steps to protect your privacy.",
      "Start by checking the app's privacy policy and looking for details on how conversations are stored or shared. Many users skip this step, but it tells you who controls your data.",
      "Next, avoid sharing sensitive details like financial information, passwords, or anything you would not want exposed. Even if the AI feels personal, it is still software connected to a company's servers.",
      "Finally, consider using apps that allow data deletion or offer clear privacy settings. Choosing tools that respect your control makes it easier to enjoy the benefits of AI without giving up too much personal security.",
      "Even if an AI chatbot seems safe, malware or phishing links could sneak in through related apps or ads. A trusted antivirus tool can block these threats and give you extra peace of mind. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Wika's engagement illustrates how technology can evolve from being a casual tool to something deeply personal.

Request it with an app or even through a virtual at-home assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant. The robot then rolls quietly from a central hub to your home, opens its lid and carries away your trash before returning to unload and recharge.

    "summary": "Macron courts a global role, sparring over Gaza and Greenland, even as France\u2019s debt crisis deepens and his prime minister risks a no-confidence vote.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron isn't just France's head of state. He's also looking like he wants to be the spokesman for the whole of Europe. He's sought to lead Europe's response to the Russia-Ukraine war, opposed the U.S. by supporting Palestinian statehood, and weighed in on former President Donald Trump's desire to buy Greenland. Yet critics say he should be focusing on issues closer to home.",
      "In Macron's France, there is real turmoil in the country's parliament over how to fix the massive debt load. And Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence as early as Monday, which he will likely lose. Bayrou was appointed by Macron in December last year, following three other prime ministers who resigned during 2024. In many ways, what happens next is\u00a0a D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu scenario where the president appoints yet another prime minister as he did last December when Michel Barnier quit.",
      "Late last month, Bayrou highlighted that France is deep in debt despite being the second-largest economy in the European Union, behind Germany. In addition to being a large economy, France is also an important U.S. trading partner.",
      "Because of the pending fiscal crisis, Bayrou developed a plan to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.6% of GDP next year by making savings of 44 billion euros ($51 billion) and cutting two public holidays. That would be a smaller deficit than in any of the years from 2020 through 2024.",

      "However, the budget-cutting plan hasn\u2019t gone down well with other parties in the French Parliament, and Bayrou faces a vote of no confidence there. Organized labor unions are incensed by the prime minister\u2019s plans and are threatening work-stoppage strikes. Leo Barincou, a senior economist at Oxford Economics in Paris, told Fox News Digital that any union strikes likely won\u2019t last long, nor will they be significantly disruptive to the economy like the Yellow Vest protests in the winter of 2018-2019.",
      "If Bayrou loses, there are alternatives. \"Macron can call\u00a0a snap election or appoint a new prime minister, but that will be hard given the current situation,\" says Elias Haddad, senior markets strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in London. \"Bayrou is expected to lose, and all the other parties have vowed to topple the government.\"",

      "One thing that almost certainly won\u2019t happen is a resignation by Macron. \"Most likely, Macron appoints another prime minister and makes a minimal budget that won\u2019t be too scary,\" Barincou says. In other words, there may be some budget cutting, but it won\u2019t be anywhere near what the current prime minister proposed in August.",
      "Although it seems extremely unlikely that there will be a snap election, the populist National Rally (RN) said it is preparing for one and is reviewing a potential list of candidates. The RN's president, Jordan Bardella, said last week, \"We can and must be ready for anything, including a return to the ballot box with a dissolution of the National Assembly,\" according to a report in Reuters.",

      "However, while France\u2019s debt problem isn\u2019t going away any time soon, it is unlikely to weigh on the broader eurozone, Haddad says. He also notes that despite a recent fall in demand to buy French bonds, there is little to panic about. \"The underlying demand is still good and unlikely to see a destabilizing situation in the financial markets,\" he says. \"The bonds are relatively healthy.\"",

In other words, too many people are relying on government handouts rather than generating income through their own efforts.",

      "Threats to members of Congress were already on the rise before Kirk\u2019s death. By the end of this calendar year, the U.S. Capitol Police said it is on track to work through 14,000 threat assessment cases involving members, up from 9,000 last year.",
      "But Johnson also acknowledged there are limitations to protecting all 535 members of Congress, pointing out it would cost billions of dollars and thousands of additional police officers to provide a security detail for every member, which is just unrealistic.",
      "\u201cThere are many security measures in place for members of Congress, at their homes, at their offices and when they go about. But we live in a dangerous society, and it\u2019s difficult to cover even the president of the United States from every angle,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe problem, ultimately, at the end of the day, is the human heart, that\u2019s what we got to address.\u201d",
      "Kirk, 31, the co-founder of Turning Point USA who is credited with turning out the youth vote for Donald Trump\u2019s successful comeback in 2024, was fatally shot by an assassin as he addressed a large crowd on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday.",
      "The gunman is still at large, though the FBI has released photos of a person of interest and said it had recovered the firearm used in the shooting.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, violent rhetoric plus the wide availability of high-powered guns and guns of all kinds equals vicious political violence, and we can control both of those things, but we haven\u2019t,\u201d said one House Democrat who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. \u201cAnd on the gun issue, it is going to require serious harm to somebody in a leadership position, or, God forbid, to a loved one, to get them to change.\u201d",
      "Kirk\u2019s death comes two months after an assassin targeted Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, killing former state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and wounding another lawmaker and his wife. That attack had already unnerved Capitol Hill, leading to a bipartisan push for enhanced security.",
      "Following the Minnesota shootings, \u201cwe had the first all-senators security briefing that I can recall in 13 years here,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who added that he\u2019ll keep doing events with his constituents but that the \u201cminuses\u201d to doing so \u201cseem to be growing.\u201d",
      "At the time, the House sergeant at arms announced that members would be eligible to receive additional funding for residential security and personal security services.",
      "But that money increase is set to expire at the end of the fiscal year later this month, and some members said leadership needs to do more to protect the rank-and-file members.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to re-evaluate what we\u2019re doing. I think we better start taking it serious,\u201d Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said. \u201cAnd our leadership is woefully ill-prepared. \u2026 They\u2019re surrounded in their little protective bubble, and they look at us, and it\u2019s been weeks after the last incident before we ever got anything.\u201d",
      "Some voices on social media are calling for retribution against the left, even though the identity or motive of the shooter is not yet known. And many Democrats are taking steps to better protect themselves. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a former top Democratic leader, said on MSNBC on Thursday that his staff has canceled events in Columbia and Charleston this weekend, though he didn\u2019t cancel an upcoming event at a church.",
      "One House Democrat from the Northeast told NBC News that she won\u2019t hold any town halls or large public events because of security concerns. Instead, she holds private, invite-only events with constituents and stakeholders. The lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted, said her family is simply too important.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police, which fought off a politically motivated and violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, said in a statement that it has \u201cbeen operating in a heightened threat environment for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur officers, agents and professional staff remain focused as they work around the clock,\u201d the agency statement continued. \u201cAlthough, for safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our increased security posture, we continue to work with our federal, state and local partners to carry out our critical mission.\u201d",
      "On Thursday morning during the House vote series, when members often walk outdoors from their offices to the Capitol, there was a noticeably stepped-up police presence outside the building. Security was already tight due to the 24th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But it\u2019s also become more common in recent years for the police to shut down the plaza outside the Capitol during votes because of growing threats against members, as they did Thursday.",
      "Some Republicans argued that members of Congress shouldn\u2019t back down from holding events.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t give into the violence,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said. \u201cIf we all retreat into our private spaces and close our doors and stay behind our locked doors and windows and gates, we need the opposite of that. We need to be able to come together even when we disagree.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has received death threats because of his many public clashes with Trump, most recently over his push to release the Epstein files, said lawmakers should take proper precautions but shouldn\u2019t back down from individuals, or even presidents, who are trying to intimidate elected officials.",
      "\u201cI, already this summer, stepped up security because of death threats. Anytime you\u2019re in the news, you just become a bigger target,\u201d Massie told reporters.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s meant to instill fear in people. I mean, if somebody just wanted Charlie Kirk to be gone, it would have been easier to meet him at the movie theater or a restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, I think, was a statement by some deranged person, most likely, and we can\u2019t let that person win.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., grew emotional while speaking to reporters Thursday and echoed that sentiment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what these folks try to do, they try to scare you into inaction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that that\u2019s the last thing that Charlie would want, is for people to be quiet, whether you agree with him or not.\u201d"

      "Without Charlie Kirk, there might not be a Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The prominent conservative activist, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking on a college campus in Utah, was integral in Vance's rise in national politics from the earliest days.",
      "Publicly, Kirk heralded Vance as a worthy Republican prospect \u2014 even when others in a party dominated by President Donald Trump had suspicions about Vance's Trump-skeptical past.",
      "And, behind the scenes, Kirk was a matchmaker, connecting Vance with others who would be invaluable to helping him navigate a course from MAGA movement outsider to insider.",
      "So when news of Kirk's death landed Wednesday afternoon, it landed particularly hard on Vance.",
      "The vice president, in a last-minute decision that underscored how close they were, canceled plans Thursday to attend a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York and instead went to Salt Lake City, where he and second lady Usha Vance were to meet with Kirk's family and friends.",
      "From there, Air Force Two was expected to transport Kirk's casket, along with his family, to Phoenix, a source familiar with the plans told NBC News. Kirk had based his political organization, Turning Point USA, there.",
      "\"Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,\" Vance wrote in a eulogy-like tribute that he posted Wednesday night on X. \"Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right \u2014 as he usually was \u2014 he was generous.\"",
      "Vance, 41, and Kirk, 31, shared common cause as representatives of a younger, Trump-inspired brand of conservatism that has thrived in a new media ecosystem populated by right-leaning podcasts. Trump's outreach to young male voters and the podcast hosts they listen to \u2014 aided by allies such as Vance and Kirk \u2014 was seen as a significant piece of his winning 2024 strategy.",
      "In his post Wednesday, Vance described Kirk as a key and influential figure in his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, where he started as an underdog in a crowded Republican primary. Kirk, he wrote, \"was one of the first people I called\" when weighing whether to run.",
      "\"We talked through everything, from the strategy to the fundraising to the grassroots of the movement he knew so well,\" Vance added. \"He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr.,\" Trump's eldest son, who \"took a call from me because Charlie asked.\"",
      "It was the beginning of a nexus that, working alongside Vance's political team in Ohio, would lead him to the White House.",
      "Andrew Surabian, who would become one of Vance's top political advisers, also linked up with Vance at Kirk's urging.",
      "\"I'll never forget that it was actually Charlie who first introduced me to JD,\" Surabian recalled Thursday in a post on X.",
      "\"He texted me out of the blue one morning, at a time when I was considering which Ohio senate candidate to sign-on with, and said, 'You need to meet JD Vance.' I texted him back: 'The Never-Trump guy!?' He called me right away and insisted that JD was 'one of us' and had experienced a true conversion about Trump.\"",
      "Surabian was \"on the phone with JD within the hour,\" and they quickly hit it off and agreed to work together.",
      "\"Charlie excitedly told me I wouldn\u2019t regret it,\" Surabian wrote. \"And he was certainly right about that.\"",

      "Inside the White House as officials learned about Charlie Kirk\u2019s death",
      "Surabian also was working closely with Trump Jr., who helped Vance smooth things over with his father. The elder Trump had been keenly aware of Vance's past criticism. At a clear-the-air meeting that Trump Jr. helped arrange at Mar-a-Lago during the early days of the Senate campaign, there was \"10 minutes of President Trump busting JD's chops\" before moving on to other topics, a person close to Vance told NBC News last year.",
      "The effort paid off for Vance's team. Trump endorsed and rallied for him in the closing weeks of the 2022 primary. In his victory speech, Vance thanked the Trumps and Surabian \u2014 and Kirk, who had campaigned alongside him in the final days of a tight race.",
      "After Vance won the general election that fall, his friendships with Kirk and Trump Jr. blossomed. As speculation turned toward Trump's selection of a running mate in 2024, both publicly promoted Vance as a strong contender at a time when Republicans like then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and then-Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota were seen as safer choices. (Both ended up as members of Trump's Cabinet after he won.)",
      "\"When I became the VP nominee \u2014 something Charlie advocated for both in public and private \u2014 Charlie was there for me,\" Vance wrote Wednesday night on X. \"I was so glad to be part of the president\u2019s team, but candidly surprised by the effect it had on our family. Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail.\"",
      "\"I felt this acute sense of guilt, that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission,\" Vance added. \"And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers.\"",
      "Vance also credited Kirk with having a hand in his and Trump's victory. He shared a photo Wednesday that showed him alongside Trump Jr., Surabian and Kirk after a campaign event days before the 2024 election.",
      "Just after midnight on Inauguration Day, a tuxedo-clad Vance took the stage with Kirk at Turning Point's inaugural ball following a performance from the Village People.",
      "\"I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you to Charlie,\" Vance said then.",
      "In his Wednesday night post, Vance noted how he and Kirk had continued to stay in touch with others through a series of mutual group texts, some of them including \"people at the very highest level of our government.\"",
      "\"I was in a meeting in the West Wing when those group chats started lighting up with people telling Charlie they were praying for him,\" Vance wrote. \"And that\u2019s how I learned the news that my friend had been shot. I prayed a lot over the next hour, as first good news and then bad trickled in.\"",
      "\"God didn\u2019t answer those prayers, and that's OK,\" Vance added. \"He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to [the] big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.\""

      "The assassination of Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist, has raised alarms about the scourge of political violence in the United States, escalating anxieties about the safety of public figures on both sides of the ideological spectrum.",
      "Kirk\u2019s killing was the latest in a series of attacks and threats targeting a range of American political figures, from President Donald Trump and members of Congress to governors and judges. Kirk was not an elected official, though he wielded influence as the founder of conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA and was a close ally of the Trump administration.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "\u201cI was not, in any way, surprised\u201d by Kirk\u2019s killing, said Michael Jensen, a researcher at the University of Maryland who tracks such violence in a domestic terrorism database. Jensen said he has seen an increase in attacks targeting what he characterizes as \u201cgovernment entities\u201d \u2014 legislators and candidates, as well as officers carrying out immigration enforcement actions.",
      "\u201cYou cannot simply say it\u2019s coming from the left, it\u2019s coming from the right [or] it\u2019s coming from the fringe. It\u2019s coming from everywhere,\u201d Jensen said.",
      "American politics has long been haunted by political violence. In the 1960s, for example, one of the most socially turbulent decades in modern U.S. history, assassins gunned down President John F. Kennedy, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King Jr., Robert F. Kennedy and the civil rights leader Medgar Evers. In the decades that followed, President Gerald Ford and President Ronald Reagan survived attempts on their lives that were captured by television cameras.",
      "But modern American life includes an accelerant that didn\u2019t exist in those earlier eras: social media and the average person\u2019s ability to easily broadcast extreme views to large audiences worldwide. It\u2019s a technological shift that has led to more intense polarization, stripping public discourse of context and nuance. As a result, many politicians have adopted these methods, too.",
      "NBC News polling data from 2010 shows that 50% of Republicans at the time viewed the Democratic Party \u201cvery\u201d negatively, while 40% of Democrats viewed the Republican Party \u201cvery\u201d negatively. A March 2025 NBC News poll showed how both figures had risen in the last 15 years, with 69% of Democrats viewing the GOP very negatively and 70% of Republicans saying they had very negative views of the Democratic Party.",
      "Jensen, the University of Maryland researcher, said the contemporary political environment, defined in part by \u201chyperpartisanship\u201d and misinformation, leads to conditions that are \u201cpotentially prime for violence.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important to understand is that all of this is happening in an information environment where the loudest and most vitriolic voices garner the largest audiences,\u201d Jensen said.",
      "In the last five years alone, the country has seen a steady drumbeat of violence.",
      "Kirk\u2019s shooting at Utah Valley University came nearly three months after a gunman killed former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, and injured State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife. Two months earlier, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro\u2019s residence was set on fire by a man who suggested he was upset by the governor\u2019s position on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",

      "In the fall of 2022, a man broke into former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s home in an effort to kidnap her and then assaulted her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. The previous year, on Jan. 6, a violent mob stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, and pipe bombs were found at both Democratic and Republican Party headquarters.",

Authorities arrested and charged a California man in the attempted murder of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2022. Two years earlier, FBI agents foiled a plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.",

Tim Walz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

      "Kirk\u2019s assassin remained at large Thursday. The shooter\u2019s identity and motivation were unknown. Kirk addressed a crowd of hundreds at Utah Valley University in an open-air campus amphitheater.",
      "In an interview, a former senior Justice Department official said it was too early to know whether Kirk\u2019s killing could lead to a greater spiral of political violence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m worried about violence but I don\u2019t have information,\u201d the former DOJ official said. \u201cTell me who did it. Tell me their motive.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got lots of times in our history where we\u2019ve had terrible, terrible divisions, one led to the Civil War,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is a lot of resilience in the American character. Most people don\u2019t like name-calling. I think that\u2019s not us.\u201d",

    "summary": "After Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, President Donald Trump could choose to tamp down anger and try to heal the nation, but he doesn't appear to be doing so, sources say.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Following Charlie Kirk\u2019s assassination, President Donald Trump may be uniquely positioned to tamp down the anger that suffuses American politics and lead a movement to bind up a bitterly divided country if he chooses.",
      "But, political strategists and officials from both parties told NBC News, that\u2019s not the path Trump appears to be taking.",
      "Trump has been both a target of assassination attempts and a fount of vitriolic rhetoric. He knows firsthand the passions that drive American voters and, were he to renounce partisan attacks and call on others in both parties to do the same, that gesture could potentially send a healing message.",
      "With the killer still at large and a manhunt underway, Trump, in his video response, laid blame on familiar foils. In a message from the Oval Office on Wednesday, he singled out the \u201cradical left\u201d and made no mention of cases in which Democratic elected officials in Minnesota and Pennsylvania were targets of violent attacks.",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said the moment is ripe for Trump to put forward a unifying message.",
      "\u201cI wish he would,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cBut I would say this: He\u2019s a populist, and populists dwell on anger.\u201d",
      "One Republican operative, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said they were rattled by Kirk\u2019s killing but ultimately unsurprised by the violence, fearing \u201cit will get worse next year.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s really not much the [Trump] administration can do,\u201d the person said. \u201cTrump has many great qualities, but he is not the type of leader that will \u2018call on better angels\u2019 and to be fair, the left does not currently have anyone that can, either.\u201d",
      "In his appearance, Trump also vowed that his administration will ferret out unspecified people and groups that \u201ccontributed to this atrocity and other political violence.\u201d",
      "Asked how Trump plans to carry out that pledge, the White House press office did not answer directly. Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, wrote in an email: \u201cThe president was clear: the perpetrator or perpetrators of this horrific act will pay for what they did. They will be caught, and they will be brought to justice. And any other whack jobs who engage in targeted political violence like the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d",
      "Trump had a fresh chance to address Kirk\u2019s death on Thursday during a 9/11 memorial ceremony at the Pentagon. This time, he eschewed any partisan comments and took a more measured tone.",
      "\u201cCharlie was a giant of his generation, a champion of liberty and an inspiration to millions and millions of people,\u201d Trump said.",
      "One senior White House official said in an interview Thursday that Trump is feeling the weight of Kirk\u2019s death. The 31-year-old conservative activist was close to Trump\u2019s political operation, helping the president turn out voters.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s disappointed and sad,\u201d the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cThe president uniquely feels that we\u2019re just in a place in this country where some people don\u2019t believe in having a different view, and they are willing to be violent about that.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most immediate thing is people want to find the killer,\u201d the official continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the most immediate practical consideration \u2014 and to honor Charlie. Then we will see what else we can do in the coming days and weeks to try and prevent this sort of thing \u2014 but also hold accountable the people that foment this sort of thing, of which there are many. These things don\u2019t just happen in a vacuum.\u201d",
      "Like Trump, the official invoked the president\u2019s adversaries,  saying that \u201cmany on the left have used violent rhetoric.\u201d",
      "As an example, the official mentioned California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom \u2014 \u201cNew-scum,\u201d as Trump calls him \u2014 who last month said of the president, \u201cWe\u2019re going to punch this bully in the mouth.\u201d",
      "Erin Perrine, a longtime Republican operative who has worked for Trump\u2019s campaign, pointed to some Democrats who blamed Trump after the shooting. Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Wednesday said Trump\u2019s \u201crhetoric often foments it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose same people lecture us about lowering the rhetoric,\u201d Perrine said.",
      "Steve Bannon, the president\u2019s longtime ally, called Kirk a \u201ccasualty of war\u201d on his podcast and, in an interview with NBC News, said Democrats were seeking political unity only on their terms. \u201cThe left always wants to bring the country together when they are losing the narrative,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see who the shooter is before we can define a specific course of action.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans and Democrats fear that Kirk\u2019s assassination marks a point of no return for the nation\u2019s politics, with violence a frightening inevitability. Threats against sitting members of Congress have been rising of late, according to U.S. Capitol Police. A spokesperson for the Democratic National Committee said Thursday that there was a bomb threat at the group\u2019s headquarters in Washington. The Capitol Police determined it was not credible.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said a suburban school board member told him that she wouldn\u2019t run for re-election a year ago, explaining that her salary \u201cwouldn\u2019t cover the cost of a funeral.\u201d",
      "Al Cardenas, who as chair of the American Conservative Union in 2013 introduced Kirk at that year\u2019s CPAC event, said in an interview: \u201cThese outcries over Charlie Kirk\u2019s murder are understandable.\u201d",
      "But he pushed back on the adage, \u201cThis is not who we are\u201d \u2014 a formulation that people often use to explain national tragedies.",
      "\u201cAs a matter of fact, it is exactly who we are,\u201d Cardenas said.",
      "Consoling a frightened nation is often part of a president\u2019s job. An iconic moment of Barack Obama\u2019s tenure came in 2015 when he sang \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d during a eulogy for the slain pastor of a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "George W. Bush presided over an uplifting moment for the country when he threw out the first pitch of a World Series game at Yankee Stadium in the month following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "Rahm Emanuel, who worked in the Bill Clinton and Obama White Houses, hearkened back to the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing that killed 168 people.",
      "Emanuel, who was working as a White House senior adviser at the time, noted that Clinton traveled to Oklahoma four days later and delivered soothing remarks.",
      "\u201cIn your mind\u2019s eye, what you think of \u2018bully pulpit\u2019 was that a president\u2019s voice has a moral tone to it,\u201d Emanuel said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re very long on bully and zero pulpit.\u201d",
      "Kirk was shot to death while speaking at an outdoor event on the campus of Utah Valley University. Afterward, a few Republicans modeled the sort of unifying message that Trump has thus far eschewed.",
      "Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican, speaking on national television in the aftermath, cited acts of violence against members of both parties, including an arson attack against Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. Shapiro was purportedly targeted in the April incident because of his stance on the war in Gaza.",
      "In his remarks, Cox also referred to what authorities described as the \u201cpolitically motivated assassination\u201d of Minnesota\u2019s former Democratic state House speaker, Melissa Hortman. Her husband and dog were also killed in the attack in June.",
      "\u201cOur nation is broken,\u201d Cox said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had political assassinations recently in Minnesota. We had an attempted assassination on the governor of Pennsylvania. And we had an attempted assassination on a presidential candidate and former president of the United States and now current president of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf anyone at the sound of my voice celebrated even a little bit at the news of this shooting, I would beg you to look in the mirror and to see if you can find a better angel in there somewhere.\u201d",
      "Another Republican official also invoked the Hortman killing. Bacon told NBC News that demonizing political rhetoric \u201chas an impact.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI have to remind people, we had Democrats killed in Minnesota too, right?\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s political persona is that of a warrior, not a conciliator. For this president, \u201cit\u2019s almost not possible for him to transcend politics in this moment,\u201d said Sarada Peri, a White House speechwriter for Obama.",
      "\u201cIt would be inauthentic,\u201d she added.",
      "But Trump does have a vice president. Often it\u2019s the No. 2 who takes on the role that a president, for whatever reason, can\u2019t or won\u2019t perform.",
      "Enter Vice President JD Vance, who was close with Kirk. So far, Vance\u2019s social media posts have not cast blame, focusing more on Kirk\u2019s life.",
      "On Thursday, the vice president abruptly shifted plans, scrapping a scheduled appearance at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York to fly to Utah. He was expected to gather there with Kirk\u2019s surviving family members and friends.",
      "Air Force Two was then expected to transport Kirk\u2019s casket, along with his family, to Phoenix, a source familiar with the plans told NBC News. Kirk had based his political organization, Turning Point USA, there.",
      "\u201cYou ran a good race, my friend,\u201d Vance wrote on X. \u201cWe\u2019ve got it from here.\u201d"

      "Without Charlie Kirk, there might not be a Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The prominent conservative activist, who was assassinated Wednesday while speaking on a college campus in Utah, was integral in Vance's rise in national politics from the earliest days.",
      "Publicly, Kirk heralded Vance as a worthy Republican prospect \u2014 even when others in a party dominated by President Donald Trump had suspicions about Vance's Trump-skeptical past.",
      "And, behind the scenes, Kirk was a matchmaker, connecting Vance with others who would be invaluable to helping him navigate a course from MAGA movement outsider to insider.",
      "So when news of Kirk's death landed Wednesday afternoon, it landed particularly hard on Vance.",
      "The vice president, in a last-minute decision that underscored how close they were, canceled plans Thursday to attend a 9/11 memorial ceremony in New York and instead went to Salt Lake City, where he and second lady Usha Vance were to meet with Kirk's family and friends.",
      "From there, Air Force Two was expected to transport Kirk's casket, along with his family, to Phoenix, a source familiar with the plans told NBC News. Kirk had based his political organization, Turning Point USA, there.",
      "\"Charlie was fascinated by ideas and always willing to learn and change his mind,\" Vance wrote in a eulogy-like tribute that he posted Wednesday night on X. \"Like me, he was skeptical of Donald Trump in 2016. Like me, he came to see President Trump as the only figure capable of moving American politics away from the globalism that had dominated for our entire lives. When others were right, he learned from them. When he was right \u2014 as he usually was \u2014 he was generous.\"",
      "Vance, 41, and Kirk, 31, shared common cause as representatives of a younger, Trump-inspired brand of conservatism that has thrived in a new media ecosystem populated by right-leaning podcasts. Trump's outreach to young male voters and the podcast hosts they listen to \u2014 aided by allies such as Vance and Kirk \u2014 was seen as a significant piece of his winning 2024 strategy.",
      "In his post Wednesday, Vance described Kirk as a key and influential figure in his 2022 Senate campaign in Ohio, where he started as an underdog in a crowded Republican primary. Kirk, he wrote, \"was one of the first people I called\" when weighing whether to run.",
      "\"We talked through everything, from the strategy to the fundraising to the grassroots of the movement he knew so well,\" Vance added. \"He introduced me to some of the people who would run my campaign and also to Donald Trump Jr.,\" Trump's eldest son, who \"took a call from me because Charlie asked.\"",
      "It was the beginning of a nexus that, working alongside Vance's political team in Ohio, would lead him to the White House.",
      "Andrew Surabian, who would become one of Vance's top political advisers, also linked up with Vance at Kirk's urging.",
      "\"I'll never forget that it was actually Charlie who first introduced me to JD,\" Surabian recalled Thursday in a post on X.",
      "\"He texted me out of the blue one morning, at a time when I was considering which Ohio senate candidate to sign-on with, and said, 'You need to meet JD Vance.' I texted him back: 'The Never-Trump guy!?' He called me right away and insisted that JD was 'one of us' and had experienced a true conversion about Trump.\"",
      "Surabian was \"on the phone with JD within the hour,\" and they quickly hit it off and agreed to work together.",
      "\"Charlie excitedly told me I wouldn\u2019t regret it,\" Surabian wrote. \"And he was certainly right about that.\"",

      "Surabian also was working closely with Trump Jr., who helped Vance smooth things over with his father. The elder Trump had been keenly aware of Vance's past criticism. At a clear-the-air meeting that Trump Jr. helped arrange at Mar-a-Lago during the early days of the Senate campaign, there was \"10 minutes of President Trump busting JD's chops\" before moving on to other topics, a person close to Vance told NBC News last year.",
      "The effort paid off for Vance's team. Trump endorsed and rallied for him in the closing weeks of the 2022 primary. In his victory speech, Vance thanked the Trumps and Surabian \u2014 and Kirk, who had campaigned alongside him in the final days of a tight race.",
      "After Vance won the general election that fall, his friendships with Kirk and Trump Jr. blossomed. As speculation turned toward Trump's selection of a running mate in 2024, both publicly promoted Vance as a strong contender at a time when Republicans like then-Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and then-Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota were seen as safer choices. (Both ended up as members of Trump's Cabinet after he won.)",
      "\"When I became the VP nominee \u2014 something Charlie advocated for both in public and private \u2014 Charlie was there for me,\" Vance wrote Wednesday night on X. \"I was so glad to be part of the president\u2019s team, but candidly surprised by the effect it had on our family. Our kids, especially our oldest, struggled with the attention and the constant presence of the protective detail.\"",
      "\"I felt this acute sense of guilt, that I had conscripted my kids into this life without getting their permission,\" Vance added. \"And Charlie was constantly calling and texting, checking on our family and offering guidance and prayers.\"",
      "Vance also credited Kirk with having a hand in his and Trump's victory. He shared a photo Wednesday that showed him alongside Trump Jr., Surabian and Kirk after a campaign event days before the 2024 election.",
      "Just after midnight on Inauguration Day, a tuxedo-clad Vance took the stage with Kirk at Turning Point's inaugural ball following a performance from the Village People.",
      "\"I just want to say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. Thank you to Charlie,\" Vance said then.",
      "In his Wednesday night post, Vance noted how he and Kirk had continued to stay in touch with others through a series of mutual group texts, some of them including \"people at the very highest level of our government.\"",
      "\"I was in a meeting in the West Wing when those group chats started lighting up with people telling Charlie they were praying for him,\" Vance wrote. \"And that\u2019s how I learned the news that my friend had been shot. I prayed a lot over the next hour, as first good news and then bad trickled in.\"",
      "\"God didn\u2019t answer those prayers, and that's OK,\" Vance added. \"He had other plans. And now that Charlie is in heaven, I'll ask him to talk to [the] big man directly on behalf of his family, his friends, and the country he loved so dearly.\""

      "\u201cThere are many security measures in place for members of Congress, at their homes, at their offices and when they go about. But we live in a dangerous society, and it\u2019s difficult to cover even the president of the United States from every angle,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe problem, ultimately, at the end of the day, is the human heart, that\u2019s what we got to address.\u201d",
      "Kirk, 31, the co-founder of Turning Point USA who is credited with turning out the youth vote for Donald Trump\u2019s successful comeback in 2024, was fatally shot by an assassin as he addressed a large crowd on the campus of Utah Valley University on Wednesday.",
      "The gunman is still at large, though the FBI has released photos of a person of interest and said it had recovered the firearm used in the shooting.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, violent rhetoric plus the wide availability of high-powered guns and guns of all kinds equals vicious political violence, and we can control both of those things, but we haven\u2019t,\u201d said one House Democrat who requested anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. \u201cAnd on the gun issue, it is going to require serious harm to somebody in a leadership position, or, God forbid, to a loved one, to get them to change.\u201d",
      "Kirk\u2019s death comes two months after an assassin targeted Democratic lawmakers in Minnesota, killing former state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and wounding another lawmaker and his wife. That attack had already unnerved Capitol Hill, leading to a bipartisan push for enhanced security.",
      "Following the Minnesota shootings, \u201cwe had the first all-senators security briefing that I can recall in 13 years here,\u201d said Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who added that he\u2019ll keep doing events with his constituents but that the \u201cminuses\u201d to doing so \u201cseem to be growing.\u201d",
      "At the time, the House sergeant at arms announced that members would be eligible to receive additional funding for residential security and personal security services.",
      "But that money increase is set to expire at the end of the fiscal year later this month, and some members said leadership needs to do more to protect the rank-and-file members.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to re-evaluate what we\u2019re doing. I think we better start taking it serious,\u201d Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said. \u201cAnd our leadership is woefully ill-prepared. \u2026 They\u2019re surrounded in their little protective bubble, and they look at us, and it\u2019s been weeks after the last incident before we ever got anything.\u201d",
      "Some voices on social media are calling for retribution against the left, even though the identity or motive of the shooter is not yet known. And many Democrats are taking steps to better protect themselves. Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, a former top Democratic leader, said on MSNBC on Thursday that his staff has canceled events in Columbia and Charleston this weekend, though he didn\u2019t cancel an upcoming event at a church.",
      "One House Democrat from the Northeast told NBC News that she won\u2019t hold any town halls or large public events because of security concerns. Instead, she holds private, invite-only events with constituents and stakeholders. The lawmaker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being targeted, said her family is simply too important.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police, which fought off a politically motivated and violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, said in a statement that it has \u201cbeen operating in a heightened threat environment for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur officers, agents and professional staff remain focused as they work around the clock,\u201d the agency statement continued. \u201cAlthough, for safety reasons, we cannot provide specific details about our increased security posture, we continue to work with our federal, state and local partners to carry out our critical mission.\u201d",
      "On Thursday morning during the House vote series, when members often walk outdoors from their offices to the Capitol, there was a noticeably stepped-up police presence outside the building. Security was already tight due to the 24th anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. But it\u2019s also become more common in recent years for the police to shut down the plaza outside the Capitol during votes because of growing threats against members, as they did Thursday.",
      "Some Republicans argued that members of Congress shouldn\u2019t back down from holding events.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t give into the violence,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said. \u201cIf we all retreat into our private spaces and close our doors and stay behind our locked doors and windows and gates, we need the opposite of that. We need to be able to come together even when we disagree.\u201d",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., who has received death threats because of his many public clashes with Trump, most recently over his push to release the Epstein files, said lawmakers should take proper precautions but shouldn\u2019t back down from individuals, or even presidents, who are trying to intimidate elected officials.",
      "\u201cI, already this summer, stepped up security because of death threats. Anytime you\u2019re in the news, you just become a bigger target,\u201d Massie told reporters.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s meant to instill fear in people. I mean, if somebody just wanted Charlie Kirk to be gone, it would have been easier to meet him at the movie theater or a restaurant,\u201d he said. \u201cThis, I think, was a statement by some deranged person, most likely, and we can\u2019t let that person win.\u201d",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., grew emotional while speaking to reporters Thursday and echoed that sentiment.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what these folks try to do, they try to scare you into inaction,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that that\u2019s the last thing that Charlie would want, is for people to be quiet, whether you agree with him or not.\u201d"

Host Kylie Kelce said some of her favorite quips from Wanda Sykes are her jokes about raising 16-year-old twins Olivia and Lucas with Alex Sykes, whom the comic has been married to since 2008.",
      "\u201cDo you run your jokes by your kids before you perform them? Kelce asked Wanda Sykes.",

      "\u201cWhen (my children) were in middle school, they did say, \u2018Um, hey, can you, like, not talk about us? Because our friends, you know, their parents let them see things that you do and then, you know, they joke on us.\u2019\u201d",

      "The single-camera and interview style show became a hit, running for nine seasons before it concluded in 2013. It also won five Emmy Awards, including outstanding comedy series.",
      "Now, over a decade later, Daniels, along with Michael Koman (\u201cNathan For You\u201d), has returned with \u201cThe Paper,\u201d a spinoff that is set in the same universe but takes on a whole new crew of quirky characters \u2014 and one familiar face.",

As the years went by, viewers got to see office romances start, fizzle and more.",
      "The 10-episode Peacock series takes viewers to Toledo, Ohio, as Ned takes over a dying historic newspaper. Filled with ambition to revive it to its glory days, he is met with opposing figures, reporters with no experience and people willing to try new things \u2014\u00a0all while the cameras capture the process.",
      "The Companies",

      "Daniel (Laurie Davidson) spends most of the new miniseries \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d torn between two women: His protective mom, Laura (Robin Wright), and his new girlfriend, Cherry (Olivia Cooke).",
      "The six-episode series, based on a novel by Michelle Frances, follows the three main players in a dance. Laura is suspicious of Cherry from the start \u2014 and, it turns out, with reason. But the lengths she goes to in order to keep Cherry from her son are just as questionable and unforgivable.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Davidson says his character Daniel is \u201cpretty oblivious to what\u2019s going on for a while.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think Daniel probably has a more balanced view of them both. He likes to see the good in both people,\u201d he reflects. \u201cDaniel defends both Laura and Cherry to each other, from each other.\u201d",

      "It\u2019s only in the final episode that Daniel awakens to the life-or-death nature of Laura and Cherry\u2019s rivalry, a moment Davidson describes as when \u201cthe penny finally kind of drops.\u201d",
      "By then, Daniel knows his mom\u2019s big secret. She lied to Cherry and said he had died in an attempt to keep them apart. Daniel and Cherry reunite but he\u2019s still open to hearing from his mom. During a rare visit home, Laura makes yet another questionable choice: She drugs Daniel so he has to sit captive and watch an incriminating video about Cherry. Of course, Cherry shows up and the three have a showdown.",
      "Daniel ultimately kills his own mother while trying to save Cherry from drowning.",
      "Waleed Zuaiter, who plays Daniel\u2019s father Harold, likens the moment to a \u201cGreek tragedy\u201d\u2014 overwhelming in its scope and consequences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like he killed his mom. It\u2019s so overwhelming,\u201d Zuaiter says. The weight of that action will define Daniel\u2019s future, creating what the actor calls \u201ca lot of guilt\u201d and \u201clessons to be learned.\u201d",
      "Another twist happens in the show\u2019s final scene, set months later. Cherry is now pregnant and it seems the family has re-adjusted to their new reality. Harold is in the background, a decision Zuaiter insisted on.",
      "\u201cI wanted to be in the final silhouette of the show. Originally, I wasn\u2019t in there. And I said, I think it\u2019s very important for Howard to, for the audience to go, OK, he\u2019s still in the picture,\u201d he reveals. \u201cHe\u2019s remaining part of this family unit, as flawed as it was.\u201d",
      "Daniel finds his mom\u2019s phone with the video and watches it, learning the truth about his wife, not girlfriend.",
      "Davidson says the \u201cmessy as hell\u201d revelation will likely lead to an entirely new crisis of identity for Daniel, who he thinks will become consumed with finding answers.",
      "\u201cDaniel would go looking for some answers from Cherry. You know, he\u2019s killed his mom to protect who he loved,\u201d he says \u2014 only to learn more about Cherry, and that his mom was protecting him.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to need a lot of therapy,\u201d he says.",
      "Both Davidson and Zuaiter are sympathetic to Laura\u2019s no-win scenario, where intervention pushes loved ones away, but inaction feels like betrayal of parental responsibility.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s her responsibility to act in the best interests that she feels for her family. It\u2019s very difficult not to do that,\u201d Davidson says.",
      "When asked about the appropriate level of family involvement in romantic partnerships, Zuaiter doesn\u2019t hesitate: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t ignore a mother\u2019s instinct.\u201d",
      "Zuiater also thinks the show has a valuable commentary on privilege. Daniel\u2019s family is very wealthy whereas Cherry is trying to transcend her lower class existence.",
      "The show suggests that \u201creal growth happens with change and discomfort,\u201d and the family\u2019s comfortable existence may have actually prevented them from developing healthy coping mechanisms.",
      "The result is what Zuaiter calls \u201ca life and death situation, because they limit their own choices, and they make their own choices about what they\u2019re suppressing, and then it just keeps building and building up.\u201d",
      "The path forward won\u2019t be easy. As Zuaiter puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of skeletons in the closet, and there\u2019s a lot of healing that needs to happen.\u201d",
      "The fear, he says, is that the family will retreat into old patterns and \u201ctheir avoidance routines, which is kind of what got them here.\u201d"

      "Nobody could have seen the twist in the last episode of \u201cThe Girlfriend\u201d coming \u2014 except Robin Wright.",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, the show\u2019s star and director reveals that she, in fact, came up with the twist. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a surprise,\u201d she says with a smile.",
      "\"The Girlfriend\" is based on a novel of the same name by Michelle Frances and follows the two most important women in an aspiring young doctor's life: His protective mother, Laura (Wright), and his new girlfriend, Cherry (Olivia Cooke).",
      "The series takes alternating viewpoints to unspool the story. Laura is suspicious of Cherry, fearing she's more attracted to the family's wealth than to her son, Daniel (Laurie Davidson) \u2014 and soon, fearing Cherry herself.",
      "Cherry, in Laura, sees an adversary and an obstacle to her ultimate happy ending and ladder up from her lower class upbringing.",
      "How does this tale end? Find out.",
      "How Does 'The Girlfriend' End?",
      "Laura and Cherry's battle for Daniel goes from passive aggressive to straight-up aggressive as the show unspools. Cherry tries to paint Laura as crazy; Laura tries to prove that Cherry is the crazy one, but is losing credibility.",
      "Then, Laura makes a drastic decision that changes the course of the show, and her son's life. After an accident during a weekend getaway with Cherry, Daniel falls into a coma. Laura sees his injury as an opening to get rid of Cherry. She tells Cherry that Daniel has died \u2014 but he hasn't. Eventually, Cherry and Daniel figure out the betrayal and reunite.",
      "Still, even after Daniel shuts her out of his life, Laura is desperate to show him who his girlfriend really is. Laura speaks to Cherry's mom and learns all about her past, including the lengths she's willing to go to get what she wants. Cherry's mom paints her as a dangerous figure.",
      "Laura visits Daniel and drugs his drink. All she needs is a moment to play the recording, she says. That, of course, is not what happens. Cherry bursts in and Laura, now desperate herself, chases her around the mansion. It culminates in a showdown in the London home's pool, where Cherry and Laura try to drown each other.",

      "Do Cherry and Daniel End Up Together in \u2018The Girlfriend\u2019?",
      "Then, Daniel wakes up from his valium-induced stupor and finishes the job for Cherry.",
      "\"He drowns her in the pool,\" Wright says.",
      "Wright says the twist came during early discussions for \"The Girlfriend\" and how it would compare to the book.",
      "\"Initially, everybody thought, 'Well, this is going to be a no-brainer. Cherry kills Laura, then she wins. And I was like, 'No, let my baby kill me,'\" Wright says, calling it a twist out of a Greek tragedy.",
      "Wright says Laura's decisions are controversial, but Laura's impulse to find fault with her son's partner is relatable.",
      "\"It's always going to be that way (with kids' partners). Not to that degree. But it'll be like, 'Oh, I don't like the way she puts her hands in her pocket,'\" she says.",
      "In this case, though, Laura's worst fears of her son's girlfriend were likely real \u2014 she would do anything to get what she wanted.",
      "Is Laura Really Dead in 'The Girlfriend'?",
      "\"She could still be alive,\" Wright says. \"If he resuscitates her, that's not on camera.\"",
      "Wright says the ending is \"open-ended\" in the sense of Laura's fate. When asked, straight-up, if she's alive, Wright responds, \"We'll see.\"",
      "When it comes to Daniel, his future and next move are also up in the air. The series ends at a gathering with Daniel, his father and Cherry, now pregnant. Daniel finds the phone that his mother had used to record Cherry's mom's confession, then watches it.",
      "All these months later, Cherry's secrets are out. On Daniel's face is a pained look: He killed his mother and now he's stuck with the woman who led him to that point.",
      "\"I said, 'If you guys want to do a Season 2, it should be called 'The Boyfriend.' And he kills her,\" Wright jokes."

      "On the call, Tatiana said, Vlad told her he was in the city of Olezhky and was \u201cgoing to Crimea to rest,\u201d which left her bewildered. \u201cAt that moment we just had a little fight,\u201d she added. \u201cI simply told him, \u2018How could you leave your family at such a difficult time?\u2019 I didn\u2019t know any details.\u201d",
      "Along with other parents, she only realized much later that Russian soldiers had been coaching children to say they were being evacuated from bombing and sent to summer camps.",
      "With fighting intense in Kherson, even after Russian forces were pushed out of the city in November 2022, Tatiana said that the month after the kidnapping, she decided to move west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Together with her husband, Olexsandr, 43, who is also Vlad\u2019s stepfather, she left the city with her other five biological children, including baby Stefania, who was less than a year old at the time. NBC News agreed not to use Oleksandr\u2019s last name as he was called up to Ukraine\u2019s army in February 2023 and is still serving. Her sister and her cousin joined them as they made their way west to the city of Mykolaiv.",
      "Although Vlad\u2019s phone was routinely checked by his Russian captors, Tatiana said, she was able to keep in touch with her son through occasional text messages, but she \u201ctold him not to create problems.\u201d",
      "\u201cI said when you can, if you are there alone or no one is escorting you, then write,\u201d she said, adding that she was able to establish he was being held in a camp in Lazurne in southeast Ukraine.",
      "After a friend told her about Save Ukraine, Tatiana said, she reached out to the organization, which after several months of planning arranged for her to travel to Russia along with six other women whose children had been taken.",
      "With no direct route across the front lines, Tatiana said, she traveled through Poland, Belarus and Russia\u2019s capital, Moscow, before she was eventually able to travel to the camp via Crimea.",
      "No one from Save Ukraine accompanied the group, she said, but its representatives were in touch by phone and arranged for her to be put up by a volunteer in a temporary home.",
      "Although she was roughly searched by masked men on arrival, Tatiana said, things initially seemed to be going well. But on the second day, she said, agents from the Federal Security Service (FSB), the successor to the KGB spy agency, came around, put a mask over her head and took her somewhere for questioning, after \u201cconfiscating my documents and my phone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey interrogated me, maybe six or seven hours,\u201d she said, adding that she was locked in a basement cell overnight before further questioning the following morning. Her interrogators were particularly interested in Save Ukraine, she said.",
      "They also brought a cameraman and a journalist, who she said expected her to say \u201chow great Russia is, how it helps us and how bad Ukraine is for us.\u201d",
      "While she was initially reluctant, she said, she was able to use Vlad\u2019s phone to consult with Save Ukraine via text message. Tatiana said the group told her: \u201cDo what is necessary, just for you to leave from there.\u201d",
      "The FSB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "After giving the interview on camera, she said, she was released with Vlad and allowed to make the arduous journey home.",
      "\u201cIt was just happiness after the horror. \u2026 I was simply amazed,\u201d Tatiana said.",
      "Kidnapped children are now spread out across approximately 200 locations from the Black Sea to Russia\u2019s Pacific coast, according to Nathaniel Raymond, the executive director of the Yale School of Public Health\u2019s Humanitarian Research Lab (HRL), the leading body tracking kidnapped Ukrainian children.",
      "The group has monitored the movement of children by analyzing satellite photos and photographing airplanes and vehicles apparently used to transport the kids, among other techniques.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t all come from the same place. They don\u2019t all go to the same place. They don\u2019t all have the same purpose,\u201d Raymond said in a telephone interview last month.",
      "Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., have floated the possibility of introducing a bill in the Senate that, if passed, could designate Russia and Belarus as state sponsors of terrorism over the kidnapping of Ukrainian children, a source familiar with the bill told NBC News in mid-August. A draft of the bill says that Belarus \u201chas directly supported the kidnapping of Ukrainian children and supported their relocation.\u201d",
      "But both Save Ukraine and the HRL took a financial hit last spring after the Trump administration cut funding for their programs.",
      "As Russia pushes to take control of more Ukrainian territory, rescuing the Ukrainian children has become an even more urgent issue, experts say.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s all the more reason to get all the kids we can back before the door closes,\u201d Raymond said.",
      "\u201cNow is the decisive moment when America cannot allow itself to step back,\u201d added Kuleba, of Save Ukraine.",
      "As for Vlad, who is now 19, he said thinking about his family kept him going during his time in captivity, and he rushed to see his baby sister Stefania as soon as he got home.",
      "Now in Ukraine\u2019s capital, Kyiv, he is hoping to become a sports trainer.",
      "\u201cWhat helped me all the time was probably that I had family in Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I could return to Ukraine and build a normal future.",

      "CHONGQING, China \u2014 For nearly two months, health officials in southern China have been waging war on mosquitos, reviving top-down tactics from the country\u2019s zero-Covid playbook.",
      "Since July, the province of Guangdong alone has reported more than 10,000 cases of chikungunya fever, a mosquito-borne viral disease that mostly circulates in tropical regions. Foshan, a manufacturing hub in densely populated Guangdong, has been the hardest-hit Chinese city \u2014 recording over 600 new infections per day at its peak, more than the combined total of 519 cases reported across mainland China from 2010 to 2019.",
      "The unprecedented outbreak prompted Chinese authorities to adopt a containment strategy akin to the country\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy \u2014 a \u201cdetect and eliminate\u201d approach.",
      "To curb the spread, workers were sent out to spray insecticide in affected areas multiple times a day. The government also required suspected patients to report their cases promptly and comply with the quarantine mandate.",
      "The outbreak in China was triggered by warmer weather this year and a fast-spreading virus strain, Liu Qiyong, chief expert of vector control at China\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state-run broadcaster CCTV.",
      "But the surge in chikungunya cases extends far beyond China as global warming accelerates the spread of infectious diseases, including dengue fever and malaria, a 2025 study found.",
      "As of mid-August, about 270,000 cases of chikungunya had been recorded globally this year, including in the Americas, Europe and Southeast Asia, leading to at least 110 related deaths, according to the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "While no locally acquired cases have been reported in U.S. states or territories since 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a travel health notice in August urging \u201cenhanced precaution\u201d amid chikungunya outbreaks in China\u2019s Guangdong province and four other countries. The CDC warned that anyone spending time in areas where chikungunya occurs is at risk.",
      "\u201cIn this rapidly changing world, infectious disease can disseminate very quickly,\u201d said Jasper Chan, a professor of clinical microbiology and infection at the University of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cEspecially after the recent Covid-19 pandemic, relevant authorities have been quite, I would say, cautious in terms of making these alert issues,\u201d he said.",
      "Chikungunya 101",
      "The chikungunya virus, first identified in Tanzania in 1952, has spread for decades mainly in the Americas, Africa and Asia. It is transmitted primarily through the bites of infected mosquitos and does not spread directly from person to person.",
      "\u201cChikungunya virus very closely resembles other mosquito-borne viruses like dengue clinically, but they belong to different families,\u201d Chan said.",
      "Its name, which comes from a language in southern Tanzania, means \u201cto bend over,\u201d a reference to the debilitating joint pain it causes. Though it is rarely fatal, chikungunya can have long-lasting, severe symptoms, including muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "As there is no specific antiviral drug to cure chikungunya, current treatment is focused primarily on relieving the symptoms. One vaccine is available in the United States. Prevention is the best protection, according to the CDC, which advises people to avoid mosquito bites and get vaccinated if necessary before they travel to places where chikungunya occurs.",
      "Chikungunya has been reported in over 110 countries across every continent except Antarctica, with at least 5.6 billion people living in places at risk from it, the WHO estimated.",
      "The disease spreads through global travelers via mosquitoes. A person gets bitten in one country, boards a plane with the virus still in the bloodstream and lands thousands of miles away, where a mosquito picks up the infection and passes it to the next person. The cycle then begins again, eventually leading to a local outbreak.",
      "Though the United States is unlikely to experience large outbreaks since people in warm areas often stay indoors with air conditioning, experts advise using mosquito repellent, wearing long sleeves and delaying trips to regions with chikungunya outbreaks.",
      "How China battles chikungunya",
      "While chikungunya is not uncommon in other parts of the world, such as Latin America, it is unusual to have big outbreaks in China, where the first imported case was identified in 2008, experts say.",
      "To stop the spread, local authorities have enlisted grassroots workers to disperse insecticide on the streets and clear stagnant pools of water where mosquitos breed. Clinics and hospitals have set up mosquito-proof beds to isolate patients, and residents have been urged to install screen windows and to light mosquito coils at home.",
      "People and organizations in China are bound by law to follow instructions from health officials in containing the virus. Failure to comply can lead to warnings, fines and even civil liability.",
      "Some have criticized the government\u2019s campaign as overkill reminiscent of Covid-era public health controls, while others have praised the quick, large-scale action.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really great to see years of accumulated old trash removed,\u201d a user wrote on RedNote, a Chinese social media platform similar to Instagram. \u201cBut it\u2019s a bit too much to dump out even the cats\u2019 water bowls. That\u2019s a classic case of the one-size-fits-all approach.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s strict controls have curbed the outbreak. As of Aug. 25, Foshan had kept new daily cases under 50 for nine days. Health officials announced that the city of more than 9 million people had ended its public health emergency response, which lasted for about a month.",
      "Experts say the bigger challenge is the impact of climate change, as rising temperatures and more severe weather create new habitats for virus-carrying mosquitos to thrive and spread diseases.",
      "Because of unusually hot weather in recent years, there has been an \u201cincreasing number\u201d of locally acquired chikungunya cases in areas that had been unaffected by the virus for the past decade, such as Europe, Chan said.",
      "\u201cRemember, humans are not alone in this globe. We\u2019re living with animals, birds, various other species, as well as all these vectors, including mosquitoes, ticks and other vectors,\u201d he said.",

      "The organizers of a Gaza aid flotilla said Tuesday that two of their boats had been attacked by drones in Tunisian waters.",
      "The Global Sumud Flotilla said Alma, a British-flagged boat in the civilian fleet, was hit by a drone while it was docked in the second such strike in two days. On Monday, the group said that one of its main boats, which is Portuguese-flagged, was also hit.",
      "Both incidents caused fire damage but no injuries, according to GSF.",
      "The attacks are an \u201corchestrated attempt to distract and derail\u201d the group\u2019s mission to deliver aid for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, GSF said in a statement, stressing that members were \u201cundeterred.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur peaceful voyage to break Israel\u2019s illegal siege on Gaza and stand in unwavering solidarity with its people presses forward with determination and resolve,\u201d it added.",
      "While a \u201cfull investigation\u201d is ongoing, Alma crew members have recovered a charred electronic device from the deck that further indicates the boat was \u201cdeliberately targeted,\u201d GSF said in a separate statement on Instagram.",
      "A spokesperson for the Tunisian Coast Guard did not respond to a call on the latest reported attack from Reuters on Wednesday.",
      "Officials earlier denied that the first boat had been attacked by a drone, saying the explosion came from inside the vessel. A National Guard spokesperson told local media that claims of the first drone attack on the flotilla \u201chave no basis in truth,\u201d Reuters reported Tuesday.",
      "With around 20 boats and participants from 44 countries, including activist Greta Thunberg, the group is the largest civilian maritime attempt to break the Israeli blockade of the Palestinian territory.",
      "Miguel Duarte, a crew member, said the suspected drone stopped close to the flotilla, moved slowly to the front and then dropped \u201cwhat was obviously a bomb\u201d on the forward part of the deck.",
      "\u201cLet me be clear 100%. It was a drone dropping a bomb on the forward deck of our ship,\u201d Duarte said when he was asked whether the team was \u201cabsolutely certain that this was a drone attack,\u201d a video he posted on Instagram shows.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m OK, but we could have been killed, right?\u201d Duarte said, citing the deaths during the Israel-Hamas war of humanitarian and medical workers.",
      "\u201cWe know the dangers that we\u2019re facing,\u201d he said.",
      "After the explosion, crew members repeatedly yelled for help and sounded the fire alarm, according to a CCTV video shared by Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur for the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s confirmed that this is a drone attack, it will be an assault and aggression against Tunisia and against Tunisian sovereignty,\u201d Albanese said. \u201cAnd again, we cannot keep on tolerating this and normalizing the illegal.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators gathered at the port of Tunis around 2 a.m. local time (10 p.m. Monday ET), some waving Palestinian and Turkish flags and chanting \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d according to a video reposted by GSF.",
      "In 2010, Israeli forces stormed a Turkish aid ship bound for Gaza and killed at least nine pro-Palestinian activists, sparking global outrage.",
      "In June, Israel intercepted a vessel of the Gaza Freedom Flotilla and detained all 12 people on board, including Thunberg.",
      "Starvation deaths in Gaza surged after Israel\u2019s blockade in March, and aid was resumed in May under a system backed by the United States and Israel. Since then, nearly 1,400 people have died and 4,000 more have been injured seeking food, with at least 859 killed near aid sites, the United Nations says."

      "The Korean Air plane is scheduled to leave Atlanta at noon ET and arrive in Seoul on Friday around 4 p.m. local time (3 a.m. ET).",
      "South Korean officials originally hoped the plane would leave Atlanta as early as Wednesday afternoon local time, shortly after it arrived from Seoul. But the foreign ministry said its departure was likely to be delayed \u201cdue to circumstances on the U.S. side,\u201d and an airport spokesperson later said the charter flight had been canceled.",
      "At a meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington on Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun learned that Trump had ordered the suspension of the repatriation process in order to discuss with South Korea whether its detained nationals \u2014 all of them skilled workers who were helping set up an electric vehicle battery plant \u2014 should remain in the U.S. to continue their work rather than be sent home.",
      "Cho told Rubio that it would be better for them to return home first and then re-enter the U.S. \u201csince these individuals were already in shock and are exhausted,\u201d a South Korean government official said.",
      "The official said that the U.S. agreed to repatriate the South Koreans and that Trump had instructed that they be transported to the airport without physical restraints such as handcuffs, in a departure from standard U.S. practice.",
      "Images of South Koreans being shackled at the wrists and ankles have caused outrage in South Korea, a key U.S. ally in Asia that has pledged hundreds of billions in U.S. investment as part of tariff negotiations. The raid came weeks after South Korean President Lee Jae Myung reinforced that commitment at a meeting with Trump at the White House.",
      "\u201cWe believe that President Trump\u2019s consideration in this regard stems from the deep bonds formed between the two leaders at the successful South Korea-U.S. summit, as well as the consistent position our government has maintained on this detention issue,\u201d the South Korean government official said.",
      "Lee said all but one of the 317 detained South Koreans had elected to fly home.",
      "\u201cEach person was allowed to choose, and the U.S. government said essentially, \u2018If you want to go, you may go; if you want to stay, you may stay,\u2019\u201d Lee said at a news conference in Seoul marking his 100th day in office.",
      "The raid has raised concerns about the potential impact on U.S.-South Korea relations, though Lee said his government had \u201cnot considered it to that depth yet.\u201d",
      "He said the incident could make South Korean companies more hesitant to invest in the U.S., where they have long sent employees on a temporary basis to provide training or assistance in areas where U.S. expertise is lacking.",
      "\u201cIf this is not allowed, companies will inevitably worry: \u2018If setting up factories in the U.S. brings endless restrictions and difficulties, should we even proceed?\u2019\u201d Lee said.",
      "What happened?",
      "The South Korean nationals were among the 475 people federal and immigration agents arrested in the raid on a construction site in the town of Ellabell, where the South Korean companies Hyundai and LG Energy Solution are jointly building an electric vehicle battery plant.",
      "U.S. officials, who said the arrested people were working or living in the country illegally, have described the raid as the largest single-site enforcement operation in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, a division of Immigration and Customs Enforcement. No criminal charges have been filed.",
      "Of the detained South Koreans, 47 were employed by LG Energy Solution and the rest were hired by subcontractors. Hyundai, South Korea\u2019s largest automaker, said none of its direct employees were detained.",
      "Most of the detained South Koreans either were engineers or they worked in after-sales services and installation, said Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration attorney who is representing at least seven of them. He said they were in the U.S. under various visa programs that South Koreans and other foreign nationals have long used to do business in the country in the face of U.S. bureaucratic delays and murky regulations.",
      "Sarah Park, president of the Korean American Coalition, said Monday that the detained workers should not be blamed for the challenges companies face trying to secure the proper U.S. visas for employees who are key to getting new facilities up and running.",
      "James S. Kim, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, said Wednesday in an interview in Seoul: \u201cI wish that Americans in America would be a little bit more sympathetic to what the Koreans have witnessed. And as long as they do that, I think the two countries can work together to kind of mitigate what had happened and move forward.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s behind the raid?",
      "Federal authorities showed up at the Hyundai-LG plant to execute a judicial search warrant in connection with what they said was a criminal investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices.",
      "According to the warrant, agents were authorized to seize employment records and immigration documents, as well as ownership and management records related to the construction site. Authorities were also looking for four people, but the reasons the federal government was specifically interested in them remain under seal.",
      "On Sunday, U.S. and South Korean government officials reached a deal to release the workers from immigration custody and return them to their home country.",
      "Consulate officials and other South Korean officials met with those detained at the Folkston ICE Processing Center over the weekend, Meredyth Yoon, a litigation director at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Atlanta, which has been assisting detainees and their families seeking legal help, told NBC News on Tuesday.",
      "Yoon said that, as part of the deal, most of the South Korean nationals had agreed to \u201cvoluntary departure,\u201d avoiding formal deportation orders.",
      "She said that about 175 of the remaining detainees \u2014 who hail from Guatemala, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador and Venezuela \u2014 remain in immigration detention and that her organization is working to connect the affected families to aid."

      "It said it was \"ready to hold consultations with the Polish Ministry of Defense on this matter.\"",

      "\u201cI have no reason to claim we\u2019re on the brink of war, but a line has been crossed,\" he told the Polish Parliament. \u201cThis situation brings us the closest we have been to open conflict since World War II.\"",
      "Belarus said that the drones had \u201clost their way\u201d and that it had also shot some down over its territory.",
      "The Polish military\u2019s operational command called the drones an \u201cact of aggression\" and initially urged residents to stay at home, with three eastern regions at particular risk. It later thanked NATO air command and the Dutch air force, which it said scrambled F-35 fighter jets.",
      "Poland and the United States are members of NATO, which at its core is a mutual defense pact formed after World War II to deal with the threat posed by the Soviet Union, meaning an attack on one may be considered an attack on all.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A bipartisan group of House lawmakers will make an official trip to China later this month, lawmakers told NBC News on Tuesday, the first such official visit by members of the House since 2019.",
      "The trip comes at a moment of fraught political and economic tensions between Washington and Beijing, and weeks after the leaders of China, Russia and North Korea met in Tiananmen Square and observed a massive military parade.",
      "The U.S. congressional delegation or CODEL to China, which has not previously been reported, is being organized by Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee and current top Democrat on the panel. Smith confirmed the trip to NBC News on Tuesday afternoon.",
      "A second lawmaker confirmed they were attending the CODEL as well. Smith said that both Democratic and Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee would participate, but that Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., would not be part of the delegation.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fairly significant. It\u2019s part of wanting to try to open up a dialogue between the U.S. and China. And I personally think it\u2019s important that you do that,\u201d Smith said in an interview just off the House floor.",
      "\u201cMerely talking with China is not endorsing everything that they do. It\u2019s like China is a big, powerful country. We are a big, powerful country. I think we need to talk about that,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo there\u2019s no significance at the timing. I think it should happen more often, on a frequent basis.\u201d",
      "Asked if the lawmakers would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Smith replied: \u201cWe\u2019re asking. We don\u2019t know yet.\u201d",
      "Some high-level U.S.-China talks are already happening. On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth spoke to his Chinese counterpart, Admiral Dong Jun, by video teleconference in their first publicly known conversation, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the call. The Pentagon on Wednesday confirmed that the phone call happened, saying they \"exchanged views in a candid and constructive manner\" and agreed to more talks.",
      "\"Secretary Hegseth made clear that the United States does not seek conflict with China nor is it pursuing regime change or strangulation of the PRC,\" chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said. \"At the same time, however, he forthrightly relayed that the U.S. has vital interests in the Asia-Pacific, the priority theater, and will resolutely protect those interests.\"",
      "Details of the lawmakers' visit are being tightly held, and even senior members of the committee were unaware it was happening. A Rogers spokesperson did not respond to questions about the trip.",
      "Smith declined to provide the names of lawmakers who will be attending or the exact dates of the travel. However, the House will be on a recess the week of Sept. 22 for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.",
      "The CODEL will also include a stop in Cambodia, Smith said, but Taiwan will not be on the itinerary.",
      "The visit comes as the Trump administration and Beijing continue negotiating a trade deal. Trump has imposed significant tariffs on China and other trading partners, but he extended the deadline to Nov. 10 for those tariffs to kick in, to give the two sides more time to strike a deal.",
      "\"My important message is, you know, we have to have dialogue and communication,\" Smith said. \"I am deeply worried that, yes, China is a major rising power that we seem to be talking less and less to. We need to figure out a way to resolve our differences and can't do it by not talking to each other.\"",
      "In 2023, then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., led a bipartisan delegation of senators to China, where they met with Xi and discussed issues such as trade, economic competition and fentanyl, according to Schumer.",
      "But House lawmakers had not visited China since March 2019, when Reps. Rick Larsen, D-Wash., and Darin LaHood, R-Ill. \u2014 then the co-chairs of the U.S.-China Working Group \u2014 led a bipartisan group to Beijing. Unlike an official government-funded CODEL, that 2019 trip was sponsored by the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations.",
      "The Covid-19 pandemic struck a year later, and official House travel to the region has since focused on Taiwan, Japan and other U.S. allies.",
      "In 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made an unannounced visit to Taiwan during a CODEL to Asia, angering Beijing and sparking live-fire military exercises around the self-governing island that China claims as its own.",
      "A year later, then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., led a House delegation to Taiwan and met with then-President Tsai Ing-wen, just as Pelosi\u2019s group did.",
      "And in 2024, then-Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a House delegation to meet with Taiwan\u2019s new president, Lai Ching-te, promising that more weapons were on the way."

      "Australia has approved the first vaccine to protect its shrinking koala population against chlamydia, a disease that accounts for as many as half of deaths in the wild among the country\u2019s iconic marsupials.",
      "Researchers spent over 10 years developing the single-dose vaccine, which Australia\u2019s veterinary medicine regulator has approved for use in wildlife hospitals and veterinary clinics and in the field.",
      "There are estimated to be 224,000 to 524,000 koalas left in Australia, according to Australia\u2019s national science agency, which cited numbers from the National Koala Monitoring Program. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature, the koala population has been cut in half in the past 20 years.",
      "Since 2022, they have been listed as endangered in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, where the monitoring program estimates the combined population is 95,000 to 238,000.",
      "Along with habitat loss, climate change and bushfires, a major reason for koalas\u2019 vulnerability is chlamydia, a sexually transmitted infection also found in humans that can cause infertility and blindness.",
      "It is not uncommon for half the koalas within a population to be infected, and rates can go as high as 70%, said Peter Timms, a professor of microbiology who led the research at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.",
      "\u201cSome individual colonies are edging closer to local extinction every day,\u201d Timms said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "While both male and female koalas can contract chlamydia through physical contact such as mating, it is a different strain from the one found in humans. A joey can also contract it from an infected mother\u2019s pouch.",
      "The vaccine was found to have reduced the likelihood of koalas\u2019 developing symptoms of chlamydia during breeding age and decreased mortality from the disease in wild populations by at least 65%.",
      "Before it was approved, the vaccine was tested on more than 500 koalas in eight trials.",
      "According to Samuel Phillips, a molecular microbiologist and senior researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast who worked on the project, the vaccine offers three levels of protection: reducing infection, preventing progression to clinical disease and in some cases reversing existing symptoms.",
      "\u201cRegistration of the vaccine has been very challenging,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cWe started this five years ago, thinking it would take one year, and here we are. Five years later, we finally got to the point.\u201d",
      "Until now, the only treatment available to koalas infected with chlamydia was antibiotics, but they can make it difficult for koalas to digest food, leading to starvation and sometimes even death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite humbling, really. I keep thinking to myself, [I] can\u2019t believe that we did this,\u201d Phillips said."
