      "Kevin Kisner is the next lead analyst for NBC Sports",
      "Kevin Kisner would not have guessed his stock was starting to rise as his golf game was starting to age.",
      "A year ago, he had finished out of the top 200 on the PGA Tour for the first time in 10 years as he struggled to find his form when NBC called and asked if he'd like to try his hand in the broadcast booth for The Sentry at Kapalua.",
      "On Wednesday, NBC Sports announced Kisner would be the lead analyst for its portfolio of golf coverage that includes two majors and the Ryder Cup.",
      "What makes Kisner with his homespun outlook and South Carolina drawl a good fit to follow Paul Azinger and Johnny Miller?",
      "\u201cI've wondered that myself,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cI think I offer a different perspective that is more player-centric. I'm not going to give you fluff because I've got an analyst's job. I'll tell it like it is. I'm not going to hinder my relationship with players, but I'll tell you if you hit a bad shot or make a bad decision.\u201d",
      "NBC had what amounted to a game of musical chairs since splitting with Azinger after the 2023 Ryder Cup outside Rome. Kisner, Brandel Chamblee of Golf Channel, Luke Donald, Paul McGinley and Brad Faxon all had stints in the chair next to lead announcer Dan Hicks. The network did not want to rush to fill the role permanently.",
      "The music stopped on Kisner.",
      "\u201cKevin always shared frank and honest opinions about the game of golf during our various conversations through the years,\u201d said Tommy Roy, the lead golf producer for NBC. \"Those kinds of opinions and his engaging personality make Kiz a great fit for our broadcast team. He knows these players, he knows this game, and the audience will get to hear more of those opinions and that personality this season.\u201d",
      "Kisner is not done with his own game. With just over $29 million in career earnings, he is using a one-time exemption from the PGA Tour career money list to be exempt for 2025.",
      "He is a four-time winner, including a World Golf Championship title at the Match Play and two other appearances in the championship match. He played in the Presidents Cups in 2017 and 2022 and was an assistant this year at Royal Montreal.",
      "The plan is for him to work 10 tournaments, which would include the U.S. Open and British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and The Players Championship. He is likely to play at least two events during the Florida swing that NBC broadcasts.",
      "He still considers himself a player and has seen signs that his swing is getting to where it was.",
      "\u201cThey were so supportive of that, and that's why I was willing to negotiate with them,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cThey want me there for the big events that I'm not exempt into, and they've been accommodating if I do get in. It's a great deal for me. NBC loves the idea that the weeks CBS is covering golf I'm playing, and hopefully playing great.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s fond of saying about golf, \u201cThis ain\u2019t no hobby.\u201d Even so, he likely will be in a far more prominent role in the NBC booth than inside the ropes next year.",

      "Sometimes the Spirit Awards overlap significantly with major Oscar contenders and winners, as in the \u201cEverything Everywhere All At Once\u201d year, and sometimes not.

    "title": "Australia is banning social media for people under 16. Could this work elsewhere \u2014 or even there?",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 16:42:33 -0500",
    "summary": "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
    "story": [
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history",
      "It is an ambitious social experiment of our moment in history \u2014 one that experts say could accomplish something that parents, schools and other governments have attempted with varying degrees of success: keeping kids off social media until they turn 16.",
      "Australia's new law, approved by its Parliament last week, is an attempt to swim against many tides of modern life \u2014 formidable forces like technology, marketing, globalization and, of course, the iron will of a teenager. And like efforts of the past to protect kids from things that parents believe they're not ready for, the nation's move is both ambitious and not exactly simple, particularly in a world where young people are often shaped, defined and judged by the online company they keep.",
      "The ban won't go into effect for another year. But how will Australia be able to enforce it? That's not clear, nor will it be easy. TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram have become so ingrained in young people's lives that going cold turkey will be difficult.",
      "Other questions loom. Does the ban limit kids' free expression and \u2014 especially for those in vulnerable groups \u2014 isolate them and curtail their opportunity to connect with members of their community? And how will social sites verify people's ages, anyway? Can't kids just get around such technicalities, as they so often do?",
      "This is, after all, the 21st century \u2014 an era when social media is the primary communications tool for most of those born in the past 25 years who, in a fragmented world, seek the common cultures of trends, music and memes. What happens when big swaths of that fall away?",
      "Is Australia's initiative a good, long-time-coming development that will protect the vulnerable, or could it become a well-meaning experiment with unintended consequences?",
      "The law will make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent children younger than 16 from holding accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that social media companies have to be held accountable, which is what Australia is trying to do,\u201d said Jim Steyer, president and CEO of the nonprofit Common Sense Media.",
      "Leaders and parents in countries around the world are watching Australia\u2019s policy closely as many seek to protect young kids from the internet's dangerous corners \u2014 and, not incidentally, from each other. Most nations have taken different routes, from parental consent requirements to minimum age limits.",
      "Many child safety experts, parents and even teens who have waited to get on social media consider Australia's move a positive step. They say there\u2019s ample reason to ensure that children wait.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s most important for kids, just like adults, is real human connection. Less time alone on the screen means more time to connect, not less,\" said Julie Scelfo, the founder of Mothers Against Media Addiction, or MAMA, a grassroots group of parents aimed at combatting the harms of social media to children. \u201cI\u2019m confident we can support our kids in interacting in any number of ways aside from sharing the latest meme.\u201d",
      "The harms to children from social media have been well documented in the two decades since Facebook\u2019s launch ushered in a new era in how the world communicates. Kids who spend more time on social media, especially as tweens or young teenagers, are more likely to experience depression and anxiety, according to multiple studies \u2014 though it is not yet clear if there is a causal relationship.",
      "What's more, many are exposed to content that is not appropriate for their age, including pornography and violence, as well as social pressures about body image and makeup. They also face bullying, sexual harassment and unwanted advances from their peers as well as adult strangers. Because their brains are not fully developed, teenagers, especially younger ones the law is focused on, are also more affected by social comparisons than adults, so even happy posts from friends can send them into a negative spiral.",
      "Many major initiatives, particularly those aimed at social engineering, can produce side effects \u2014 often unintended. Could that happen here? What, if anything, do kids stand to lose by separating kids and the networks in which they participate?",
      "Paul Taske, associate director of litigation at the tech lobbying group NetChoice, says he considers the ban \u201cone of the most extreme violations of free speech on the world stage today\" even as he expressed relief that the First Amendment prevents such law in the United States",
      "\"These restrictions would create a massive cultural shift,\u201d Taske said.",
      "\u201cNot only is the Australian government preventing young people from engaging with issues they\u2019re passionate about, but they\u2019re also doing so even if their parents are ok with them using digital services,\" he said. \"Parents know their children and their needs the best, and they should be making these decisions for their families \u2014 not big government. That kind of forcible control over families inevitably will have downstream cultural impacts.\u201d",
      "David Inserra, a fellow for Free Expression and Technology, Cato Institute, called the bill \u201cabout as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike\u201d in a recent blog post. While Australia's law doesn't require \u201chard verification\u201d such as an uploaded ID, he said, it calls for effective \u201cage assurance.\u201d He said no verification system can ensure accuracy while also protecting privacy and not impacting adults in the process.",
      "Privacy advocates have also raised concerns about the law's effect on online anonymity, a cornerstone of online communications \u2014 and something that can protect teens on social platforms.",
      "\u201cWhether it be religious minorities and dissidents, LGBTQ youth, those in abusive situations, whistleblowers, or countless other speakers in tricky situations, anonymous speech is a critical tool to safely challenge authority and express controversial opinions,\u201d Inserra said.",
      "A spot check of kids at one mall in the Australian city of Brisbane on Wednesday didn't turn up a great deal of worry, though.",
      "\u201cSocial media is still important because you get to talk to people, but I think it\u2019s still good that they\u2019re like limiting it,\u201d said Swan Son, a 13-year-old student at Brisbane State High School. She said she has had limited exposure to social media and wouldn\u2019t really miss it for a couple of years. Her parents already enforce a daily one-hour limit. And as for her friends? \u201cI see them at school every day, so I think I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d",
      "Conor Negric, 16, said he felt he\u2019d dodged a bullet because of his age. Still, he considers the law reasonable. \u201cI think 16 is fine. Some kids, I know some kids like 10 who\u2019re on Instagram, Snapchat. I only got Instagram when I was 14.\"",
      "His mom, Sive Negric, who has two teenage sons, said she was happy for her boys to avoid exposure to social media too early: \u201cThat aspect of the internet, it\u2019s a bit `meanland.'\"",
      "Parents in Britain and across Europe earlier this year organized on platforms such as WhatsApp and Telegram to promise not to buy smartphones for children younger than 12 or 13. This approach costs almost no money and requires no government enforcement. In the United States, some parents are keeping kids off social media either informally or as part of an organized campaign such as Wait Until 8th, a group that helps parents delay kids' access to social media and phones.",
      "This fall, Norway announced plans to ban kids under 15 from using social media, while France is testing a smartphone ban for kids under 15 in a limited number of schools \u2014 a policy that could be rolled out nationwide if successful.",
      "U.S. lawmakers have held multiple congressional hearings \u2014 most recently in January \u2014 on child online safety. Still, the last federal law aimed at protecting children online was enacted in 1998, six years before Facebook\u2019s founding. In July, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation designed to protect children from dangerous online content, pushing forward with what would be the first major effort by Congress in decades to hold tech companies more accountable. But the Kids Online Safety Act has since stalled in the House.",
      "While several states have passed laws requiring age verification, those are stuck in court. Utah became the first state to pass laws regulating children\u2019s social media use in 2023. In September, a judge issued the preliminary injunction against the law, which would have required social media companies to verify the ages of users, apply privacy settings and limit some features. NetChoice has also obtained injunctions temporarily halting similar laws in several other states.",
      "And last May, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said there is insufficient evidence to show social media is safe for kids. He urged policymakers to treat social media like car seats, baby formula, medication and other products children use.",
      "\u201cWhy should social media products be any different? Scelfo said. \u201cParents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A basic tenet of journalism \u2014 calling someone for comment on a story \u2014 was seen as a threat by defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth's mother",
      "To The New York Times, it was a standard journalistic practice done in the name of fairness \u2014 asking someone involved in a story for comment. To the mother of the nominee for secretary of defense, it constituted a threat.",
      "On Wednesday, Pete Hegseth's mother accused the Times of making \u201cthreats\u201d by calling about its story on an email she had sent to her son six years earlier that criticized his treatment of women.",
      "Penelope Hegseth sought and received an interview on Fox News Channel to support her son, whose confirmation chances are threatened by a series of damaging stories about his personal conduct. At one point, she said she wanted to directly tell President-elect Trump that her son \u201cis not that man he was seven years ago.\u201d",
      "She also called the Times \u201cdespicable\u201d and attacked a basic tenet of journalism: giving someone the chance to speak for a story about actions that could be seen in a negative light.",
      "The Times' story, published Saturday, quoted from a private email that Penelope Hegseth sent to her son in 2018 while he was in the midst of divorcing his second wife. She criticized his character and treatment of women, suggesting that he get some help.",
      "\u201cI have no respect for any man that belittles, lies, cheats, sleeps around and uses women for his own power and ego,\u201d she wrote to her offspring. \u201cYou are that man (and have been for many years).\u201d",
      "She told the Times for its story that she had sent the email in a moment of anger and followed it up two hours later with an apology. She disavows its content now.",
      "When the Times called her for comment on the story, Hegseth told Fox News that, at first, she did not respond. She said she perceived the calls as a threat \u2014 \u201cthey say unless you make a statement we will publish it as is and I think that's a despicable way to treat anyone,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI don't think a lot of people know that's the way they operate,\u201d she said, speaking about the story. She accused the newspaper of being in it \"for the money. And they don't care who they hurt, families, children. I don't believe that's the right way to do things.\u201d",
      "Charles Stadtlander, a spokesman for the Times, said Hegseth's claim \u201cis flatly untrue,\u201d and she was in no way threatened. \u201cThe Times did what it always does in reporting out a story, simply reaching out and asking for a comment, which we included,\u201d he said.",
      "Such a call is the opposite of a threat \u2014 it's an attempt to be fair, said Tom Rosenstiel, a University of Maryland professor and co-author of \u201cElements of Journalism: What News People Should Know and What the Public Should Expect.\u201d \u201cShe's basically saying that brake lights are a threat because they alert you that the car ahead of you is about to stop,\" he said.",
      "But many Americans would perceive that call as a threat, or certainly as rude and a violation of privacy, said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cShe didn't write that email to be on the front page of The New York Times,\u201d he said.",
      "A secondary question is the newsworthiness of publishing the content of the private email, one that Hegseth said she almost immediately regretted sending and doesn't reflect how she perceives her son. Graham suggested that the newspaper wouldn't do the same for the nominee of a Democratic president-elect. \u201cThe New York Times is out to destroy these nominees,\u201d he said.",
      "In its initial story, the Times wrote that it had obtained a copy of the email \u201cfrom another person with ties to the Hegseth family.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a piece of independently reported journalism published in the name of public awareness of the nominee to lead the largest department in the federal government,\u201d Stadtlander said. \u201cWe stand behind it completely.\u201d",
      "In many circumstances, an email from a mother to her son would be considered a private matter and out of bounds to a news organization, Rosenstiel said. But in this case, Hegseth, a former Fox News weekend host chosen by Trump to lead the Pentagon, has built himself into a public figure and is up for a very important job \u2014 and one that leads the military, which involves waging war and in which character is considered a fundamental trait.",
      "\u201cIt makes this news, honestly,\u201d Stadtlander said.",
      "The Times wrote about Penelope Hegseth's Fox interview on Wednesday, leading with her saying her son \u201cwas not the same man he was in 2018 when she fired off an email accusing him of routinely abusing women and lacking decency and character.\u201d",
      "There was some question about whether Hegseth would appear for an interview at his former network on Wednesday, after CNN's Kaitlan Collins posted on X the night before that \u201cmultiple people\u201d said that was expected. A Fox News representative said that no such interview had been scheduled, and the nominee was on Capitol Hill meeting with senators.",
      "He has faced a flurry of other damaging reports, including stories about a sexual assault allegation reported to police in 2017. No charges were filed then, and Hegseth said the relationship was consensual. The New Yorker magazine wrote about reports of financial mismanagement, sexist behavior and excessive drinking when Hegseth ran a veterans' organization, and NBC News wrote about people at Fox News concerned about his alcohol use.",

    "summary": "UNESCO has listed the restoration techniques for the zinc roofs of Paris as an Intangible Cultural Heritage",
    "story": [
      "UNESCO has listed the restoration techniques for the zinc roofs of Paris as an Intangible Cultural Heritage",
      "PARIS -- From before sunrise to after sunset, in slippery winters and scorching summers, the roof restorers of Paris toil away, replacing the zinc sheets that help define the city\u2019s famous skyline.",
      "A special spotlight is now shining on their little-noticed skills: UNESCO inscribed the zinc roof restoration techniques on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage on Wednesday.",
      "\u2033The restoration of a roof involves removing the old pieces of zinc, measuring and custom-cutting new pieces using a Parisian folding machine, and assembling and fixing the pieces onto the roof,\u2033 UNESCO said in its citation. \u2033With nearly 80 percent of the roofs in Paris covered in zinc, the city is a living archive of these skills that shape the unique identity of its urban landscape.\u2033",
      "Most of the roofers are men, most are young. They often like heights, architecture, and working outdoors.",
      "Fantine Dekens, 21, is a climber who worked as a bartender but wanted a profession that took her outside and high up. She has been working as a roofer since 2021.",
      "\u2033There is a sort of romanticism around the roofs of Paris that attracted me,\u2033 she told the Associated Press.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s super to be outdoors. But there is a physical reality that you can\u2019t ignore. It\u2019s often very cold, or very hot, the things to carry are heavy,\u2033 she said. \u2033You can\u2019t do this trade eternally.\u2033",
      "Roofers are hoping the UNESCO recognition will inspire others to join their ranks and improve their working conditions.",
      "The profession is short of workers with the specialized skills for preserving the zinc roofs that have been a distinctive feature of Paris since the 19th century Haussmann era, from balconied apartment buildings along tree-lined avenues to historic churches that dot the French capital.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s a recognition for our trade, but for me, it\u2019s only useful if it is accompanied by a reflection on why there are so few roofers,\u2033 she said.",
      "Using welding techniques from the 1800s, they measure each new sheet of zinc so it fits the shape of the roof just right. Then they mount the often slippery roofs to affix the sheets to their new home.",
      "\u2033There\u2019s a very poetic side when you\u2019re up high,\u2033 she said. \u2033I feel very free in my movements. We take naps during our breaks. Often we sing, we shout. No one is watching us. And we can observe all of Paris at the same time. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\u2033",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014-",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the roof techniques were inscribed as UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Culture Heritage, instead of World Heritage."

      "Sake is perhaps even more Japanese than the world-famous sushi",
      "LUQUE, Paraguay -- Sake is perhaps more Japanese than the world-famous sushi. It's brewed in centuries-old mountaintop warehouses, savored in the country\u2019s pub-like izakayas, poured during weddings and served slightly chilled for special toasts.",
      "The smooth rice wine that plays a crucial role in Japan's culinary traditions was enshrined on Wednesday by UNESCO on its list of the \u201cintangible cultural heritage of humanity.\"",
      "At a meeting in Luque, Paraguay, members of UNESCO\u2019s committee for safeguarding humanity's cultural heritage voted to recognize 45 cultural practices and products around the world, including Brazilian white cheese, Caribbean cassava bread and Palestinian olive oil soap.",
      "Unlike UNESCO\u2019s World Heritage List, which includes sites considered important to humanity like the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt, the Intangible Cultural Heritage designation names products and practices of different cultures that are deserving of recognition.",
      "A Japanese delegation welcomed the announcement in Luque.",
      "\u201cSake is considered a divine gift and is essential for social and cultural events in Japan,\u201d Takehiro Kano, the Japanese ambassador to UNESCO, told The Associated Press.",
      "The basic ingredients of sake are few: rice, water, yeast and koji, a rice mold, which breaks down the starches into fermentable sugars like malting does in beer production. The whole two-monthlong process of steaming, stirring, fermenting and pressing can be grueling.",
      "The rice \u2014 which wields tremendous marketing power as part of Japan's broader cultural identity \u2014 is key to the alcoholic brew.",
      "For a product to be categorized Japanese sake, the rice must be Japanese.",
      "The UNESCO recognition, the delegation said, captured more than the craft knowledge of making high-quality sake. It also honored a tradition dating back some 1,000 years \u2014 sake makes a cameo in Japan\u2019s famous 11th century novel, \u201cThe Tale of Genji,\u201d as the drink of choice in the refined Heian court.",
      "Now, officials hope to restore sake's image as Japan's premier alcoholic drink even as the younger drinkers in the country switch to imported wine or domestic beer and whiskey.",
      "\u201cIt means a lot to Japan and to the Japanese,\u201d Kano said of the UNESCO designation. \"This will help to renew interest in traditional sake elaboration.\u201d",
      "In Tokyo, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, in a statement, said he was \u201cdelighted\u201d by the inscription of traditional sake-making, the traditional technic that Japan is proud of. Ishiba congratulated those who dedicated to preserving and promoting the tradition.",
      "Also, Japanese breweries have expressed hope that the listing could give a little lift to the country's export economy as the popularity of sake booms around the world and in the United States amid heightened interest in Japanese cuisine.",
      "Sake exports, mostly to the U.S. and China, now rake in over $265 million a year, according to the Japan Sake and Shochu Makers Association, a trade group.",
      "Japan's delegation appeared ready to celebrate on Wednesday \u2014 in classic Japanese style.",
      "After the announcement, Kano raised a cypress box full of sake to toast the alcoholic brew and cultural rite.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 08:34:28 -0500",
    "summary": "An Irish YouTuber hopes to raise millions of dollars for charity this holiday season &mdash; and is using a popular gaming technology to rally his fans around the cause",
    "story": [
      "An Irish YouTuber hopes to raise millions of dollars for charity this holiday season \u2014 and is using a popular gaming technology to rally his fans around the cause",
      "NEW YORK -- Se\u00e1n McLoughlin wears a lot of hats: YouTuber. Voice actor. Coffee entrepreneur. But McLoughlin, better known by his pseudonym Jacksepticeye, likes to say he would be a therapist if he wasn't posting video game playthroughs for his nearly 31 million subscribers.",
      "The 34-year-old Irish creator finds that gaming enthusiasts aren't just drawn by his expressive reactions to the latest action role-playing games; fans also resonate with his candid discussions of mental health. The supportive responses from his niche but passionate following make McLoughlin feel \u201cless alone,\u201d he said, forging the same camaraderie that brought him to online gaming communities as a lonely 20-something living at his family\u2019s remote home.",
      "That shared connection is also central to his annual fundraiser, \u201cThankmas.\" The charity livestream is one of many online specials emerging as a modern spin on the classic telethon. Total donations have increased more than 50% over the last year on Tiltify, a digital platform that integrates giving tools into streams. The spaces are credited for allowing more authentic interactions between nonprofits and young donors \u2014 and encouraging benevolence in a corner of the web marked by incendiary rhetoric.",
      "\u201cIf you want to do good things, the people are there, and they\u2019ll listen,\u201d McLoughlin said. \u201cThey\u2019re already following you for what you do for a reason. So they\u2019ll follow you to help out people as well.\u201d",
      "Follow they have. His streams have raked in more than $26 million, according to partner Tiltify. This year's goal is to collect $6 million for two nonprofits supporting mental health: Crisis Text Line and Samaritans.",
      "A seven-figure target would have seemed a longshot when McLoughlin entered the space. The initial idea was to hold monthly fundraisers. He hosted seven charitable streams in 2018, Tiltify records show, for causes including pediatric cancer and clean water. The year culminated in the inaugural \"Thankmas,\" which pulled over a quarter of a million dollars.",
      "But McLoughlin said the pace became \u201ca bit much.\u201d That same year he announced a brief break from YouTube, in part due to unhappiness from the demands he felt for high content volumes. He resolved to focus on one big holiday event at the end of the year, when he said people are \u201ca bit more giving and heartfelt.\u201d",
      "It wasn't until 2020 that Tiltify CEO Michael Wasserman said the two began working closely to maximize the streams' reach. McLoughlin reached out, according to Wasserman, and said he wanted something \u201cmore impactful.\u201d With communities worldwide reeling from the pandemic, they put together the #HopeFromHome campaign: a peer-to-peer event where multitudes could simultaneously rally around the same cause. McLoughlin served as a tent pole supporting the other streamers.",
      "Their first effort together yielded $1.9 million for United Way Worldwide and more than one-third came from McLoughlin\u2019s stream alone. The following \u201cThankmas\u201d generated more than $4.7 million. Wasserman said he\u2019d never seen his technology used so collaboratively.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what really made this a regular, multimillion-dollar event,\" Wasserman said. \u201cNot just making it, \u2018Hey I\u2019m going to fundraise and just watch me,' but, \u2018We as a community can do this and get involved together.'\u201d",
      "This year's \u201cThankmas\u201d will be performed before a live audience in Los Angeles but broadcast online. Recent specials have seen McLoughlin make surprise calls into streams that are also pooling contributions. Comedic segments sometimes feature traditional celebrities; actor Jack Black played a life-sized game of Jenga in 2022.",
      "The idea resembles the star-studded telethon pioneered last century by comedian Jerry Lewis. But new technologies and web cultures enable more engaging experiences. Wasserman said charitable livestreams like McLoughlin's are not a \u201cpassive watching experience.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s \u201ca much more personable approach to giving,\u201d according to Yvette Wohn, a professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology who studies human-computer interaction.",
      "A streamer\u2019s audience \u201ccares about them,\u201d Wohn said, and donors flock to their content because \u201cthey really like that person.\u201d Social media and chat boxes allow fans to feel seen by hosts in ways television viewers could never expect. Followers might get shoutouts by name upon contributing. McLoughlin has previously shared fan art submitted through specific hashtags.",
      "Fandoms also develop subcultures. McLoughlin\u2019s gaming catchphrases are especially popular among his circles. Jacksepticeye content often starts with him shouting, \u201cTop of the morning to ya, laddies!\u201d and fans have uploaded video compilations of the expression. Members then form friendships with others in the fandom. That creates a \u201cpositive social pressure\u201d to donate, according to Wohn, helping new generations \u201cdip their toes into building an identity as somebody that gives.\u201d",
      "\u201cGiving habits are things that build over time,\u201d Wohn said. \u201cIf younger people start to engage in this culture of giving, I feel like the general culture of giving might expand in ways that cannot be done from a top-down perspective.\u201d",
      "Still, McLoughlin describes online communities as a \u201cdouble-edged sword.\u201d The \u201cmonetization of hate,\u201d he said, is \u201cbigger than it's ever been.\u201d And the desire for acceptance can introduce lonely people to dark pockets of the internet that nevertheless provide kinship.",
      "\u201cThankmas\u201d aims to prove it's easy to do good online. Yes, he acknowledged, charity work is \u201cquite intimidating.\" Where is the line between promoting the fundraiser and promoting himself? McLoughlin doesn't know. He just hopes people trust it's coming from the right place.",
      "At least one longtime follower was drawn by McLoughlin's ties to this year's cause. Jack Worthey, a 20-year-old from Texas, said McLoughlin brought much comfort growing up with \u201csimilar family troubles.\" It had been several years since he watched Jacksepticeye content, he said, but he was pulled back by an October video where McLoughlin detailed his journey finding mental health treatment.",
      "Worthey said he wouldn't have looked into \"Thankmas\" had McLoughlin had not made the promotion so personal. He now plans to raise awareness through digital art. For Worthey, returning to the channel as an adult and seeing the \u201cpositive product\u201d has been \u201creally amazing.\"",
      "\u201cIt makes you see what I was enjoying when I was younger in a different light,\u201d Worthey said. \"It brings a different type of joy.\u201d",

Knightley says the show, debuting Thursday, falls under the \u201cDie Hard\u201d category of Christmas fare.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019ve spent too much time with my family, I hate them all, I need to watch something blow up,\u2019\" Knightley said during a recent interview alongside Whishaw. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a nice time, you can watch \u2018Love Actually.\u2019 And if you\u2019re feeling quite cross, you can watch \u2018Black Doves.' Christmas entertainment is provided. You're welcome!\"",
      "Knightley's character Helen is a spy for a secret agency called Black Doves, which has no alliances but is contracted by the highest bidder. When Helen's lover is murdered, an old friend, Sam (played by Whishaw), who calls himself a \u201ctrigger man,\u201d is brought in to protect her. He also vows to help Helen get revenge.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s appealing to do something you\u2019ve never done before,\" said Whishaw. \"I felt like the character had this sort of core truth, even though they all are in a quite heightened world where it is possible to be sort of blasted out of a five-story building and not get a scratch.\u201d",
      "Knightley also found something relatable about her character \u2014 everyone has different sides of themselves that they show to different people.",
      "\u201cI have two kids. My identity as a mother is very big, but I also hold quite contradictory identities within myself, which are also true but don\u2019t necessarily exist at the same time as I am being a mother,\" she said.",
      "She also loved that Sam and Helen's friendship is \"between these two very strange characters,\u201d said Knightley. \u201cThey can\u2019t be themselves with anybody else in the world, but they can be their whole selves with each other.\u201d",
      "The roles on the show are atypical for a spy series. Sam and Helen report to a woman as their stoic spy director, played by Sarah Lancashire. Women were also cast to play the heads of crime syndicates. Sam is a lethal killer who happens to be gay.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always more interesting doing things which are less expected,\" said the show's creator Joe Barton of his casting choices.",
      "The job gave Whishaw the opportunity to learn stunts and appear in action sequences which he found \u201cfrightening\" in the beginning.",
      "\u201cI hadn\u2019t done that sort of stuff before. And I guess if I\u2019m honest, I am very slightly built and I feel like (action) is the territory or the terrain of like, big blokes. I had to really get over something in myself but I\u2019m pleased I did.\u201d"

      "One of Venezuela\u2019s most popular bands has canceled its homecoming tour after President Nicolas Maduro criticized the group for what he said were sexist lyrics",
      "MIAMI -- One of Venezuela's most popular bands canceled its homecoming tour after President Nicolas Maduro criticized the group for what he said were sexist lyrics \u2014 a lashing out that many said was an attack by the leftist leader over the band's embrace of his political opponents.",
      "Rawayana, a 2025 Grammy nominee, was to play across the country to sold-out shows, starting this week but the concerts were abruptly cancelled on Tuesday night.",
      "On Sunday, Maduro laid into the group for its hit song \"Veneka\" \u2014 a term long used by Latin Americans to refer to Venezuelans but which has become pejorative over the past years as millions of Venezuelans fanned across the continent, fleeing poverty and Maduro's increasingly authoritarian rule.",
      "\u201cThe group that made that song didn't just mess things up, they stepped in it, they stepped in it,\u201d an angry Maduro said at a rally in Caracas, the country's capital. \u201cThe women of Venezuela are called Venezuelans with respect and dignity. They are Venezuelans, not venekas!\u201d",
      "Rawayana took the term for the name of its catchy tune, which mixes salsa and an electronic dub groove with misogynistic lyrics. Still, the band claims the song celebrates Venezuelan women\u2019s beauty and strength.",
      "The tour was to be something of a homecoming for Rawayana, which was formed in Caracas in 2007.",
      "Some of its members, like millions of Venezuelans, have abandoned their homeland in recent years as the economy nosedived and Maduro tightened his grip on power. While the group has mostly steered clear of politics, it leveraged its powerful voice among Venezuelan youth to protest Maduro's reelection this summer amid widespread allegations of fraud.",
      "\u201cThis is how we say goodbye to our country until further notice,\u201d the group said in a post on social media post announcing the cancelled tour. \u201cOur music is not meant to divide....Peace.\u201d",
      "Cusica, a two-day music festival in Caracas that was also to begin this week, was also cancelled. The festival's organizers were also the producers of Rawayana's Venezuelan tour.",
      "Many Venezuelans took to social media to denounce what they consider an unfair attack on the group by Maduro.",
      "\u201cI've never gone to a concert in my 23 years and with great effort I managed to gather my money,\u201d said one upset fan on Instagram. \"We can't even be happy any more.\"",
      "Beto Monte, the group's vocalist and guitarist, declined an interview request, citing security risks. \u201cWhat can be seen a mile away doesn't require much explanation,\u201d he said in a statement provided to The Associated Press.",

      "Anthony Robles\u2019 story is tailor made for a Hollywood film",
      "Anthony Robles\u2019 story seems almost tailor made for a Hollywood film. Born with only one leg, his right, he overcame the prejudices of those around him and his own physical limitations to become a champion wrestler. Though coaches at the top wrestling programs couldn\u2019t see his potential, he was undeterred, coasting on his own determination and his mother Judy\u2019s ( Jennifer Lopez ) unwavering belief in him.",
      "The film version is aptly titled \u201cUnstoppable,\u201d and it\u2019s getting a limited theatrical release starting Friday before it streams on Prime Video on Jan. 16. Directed by William Goldenberg, the Oscar-winning editor of \u201cArgo\u201d making his feature directorial debut, \u201cUnstoppable\u201d has all the makings of a rousing sports drama that\u2019s sure to have audiences cheering in theaters or on their couches. You\u2019d have to be a certain kind of grinch not to get swept up in the hurdles and triumphs, especially with such a compelling lead performance from Jharrel Jerome. And yet for a story about a guy who shattered expectations, the film itself is rather conventional.",
      "Eschewing the temptation to tell his story from birth, \u201cUnstoppable's\u201d arc begins at the end of high school. He chose long ago to not rely on a prosthetic and is comfortable in his body. His sport is wrestling, which he\u2019ll joke later that he chose because it was the only one where the other guy couldn\u2019t run away from him.",
      "Though he\u2019s winning at the high school level, the exciting college programs, like Iowa, are not interested in taking a chance on him. His best offer is a full ride at Drexel in Philadelphia, which everyone agrees is better than walking on at one of the better-known schools. But complications on the home front force his hand and soon enough he\u2019s walking on at Arizona State University, trying to prove himself to a coach, Sean Charles (Don Cheadle), who had already advised him to go elsewhere.",
      "Mom as eldest son\u2019s biggest cheerleader isn\u2019t, but Judy has a lot going on. She had Anthony at age 16 and, when we meet up with them, is married and has four young children with Rick (Bobby Cannavale), a toxic husband and father who goes long on the virtues of making the right choices and being a man and providing for his family (which, spoiler, he doesn\u2019t). It\u2019s a very one-note role for Cannavale, just a shorthand villain who\u2019s always just around the corner ready to ruin things, whether it\u2019s dinner or Anthony\u2019s plans to move across the country.",
      "Regardless of how much this is true, \u201cUnstoppable\u201d relies too heavily on the cliches of a working-class domestic drama and Rick\u2019s vileness which perhaps is a little insulting to Judy\u2019s experience. This is a woman who managed to achieve incredible things (revealed at the end) despite being a single mother to five. While Lopez is magnetic as always, it\u2019s hard not to wonder what this character might have looked like if one of the three credited screenwriters had been a woman. Judy does get her own arc and demonstrates her agency in a mic drop kind of scene, but it seems like a rather small moment to concentrate on once you\u2019ve learned what she went on to accomplish.",
      "The film is really best when it\u2019s about the sport, the impossible training including a run up a rocky hill that Anthony does on his crutches, the matches, and Anthony\u2019s relationships with his coaches who become de facto father figures for him. Michael Pe\u00f1a, as his high school coach, is particularly impactful in his limited scenes, and Cheadle is always a joy. But it\u2019s ultimately Jerome\u2019s show, and a good one at that. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the first of many leading film roles for him.",
      "\u201cUnstoppable,\u201d an Amazon MGM Studios release in select theaters Friday and streaming on Prime Video on Jan. 16, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome strong language and thematic material.\u201d Running time: 116 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four."

      "\u201cThis moment in time is exactly the chapter where I get to howl like a wolf in a song if I want to. And I don\u2019t have to feel weird about it,\u201d she says.",
      "Mayberry, 37, is enjoying the freedom to create whatever she likes, away from the synth-pop of the band she has been with since her early 20s.",
      "\"It\u2019s a mission statement of all things that you like, and you just go in and write the song that feels like it wants to be written on that day, which was quite refreshing,\" she says.",

      "Mayberry cites Sinead O'Connor, Tori Amos, Fiona Apple and Annie Lennox as influences. She credits the yodel inflection in her voice to having listened to so much Alanis Morissette.",
      "\u201cIt was those influences I wanted to dig into a bit more in my own material,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I thought back to what are the key influences on me as a writer, it isn\u2019t really a lot of synth-pop stuff. So then it\u2019s interesting that that\u2019s what I became so associated with.\"",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t really have one specific lane in mind for the genre we were going down,\" he says. \"We were just being experimental, and I guess the freedom within that just brought us something a bit different.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought I was finally writing a hopeful, cheerful, uplifting song, and then I was like, 'Well, still about death, isn\u2019t it?'\u201d Mayberry says, laughing. \u201cMaybe it's a Scottish thing. I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just a bit morose.\u201d",
      "On the album, Mayberry explores mortality, nostalgia, societal pressures, arrogant exes and her band (\"I killed myself to be one of the boys,\u201d she sings in one song.)",
      "\u201cThe lyrics I like least that I\u2019ve written are ones that I know didn\u2019t feel very authentic to me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think you can hear in somebody\u2019s physical voice when they\u2019re singing, whether they mean something or not. So my only brief is like, 'Does it feel fake?'\u201d",
      "Regardless of how the album does with critics or charts, Mayberry is proud it's out there, proof of her musicianship and confirmation that she doesn't need anyone to make good songs.",

      "NEW YORK -- Just one retail chain was enough for Taylor Swift to have the top-selling book last week and the biggest publishing launch of 2024.",
      "According to Circana, Swift's \u201cEras Tour Book\u201d sold 814,000 copies over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. Circana tracks around 85% of the print market, but the \u201cEras\u201d numbers are more precise: Swift sold the book exclusively through Target, which launched the \u201cEras\u201d tie-in on Black Friday.",
      "Sales soared even as Swift skipped Amazon.com and other retailers and as some fans complained online that the $39.99 book included typos and other errors. Representatives for Target and Swift did not immediately respond to requests Wednesday for comment.",
      "The sales put Swift in rare company. The only bigger nonfiction launch was the first volume of Barack Obama\u2019s presidential memoirs, \u201cA Promised Land,\" which sold 816,000 copies its first week on shelves in 2020, according to Circana, which does not include audio and e-book sales. But Obama\u2019s memoir was available through all major outlets and Circana\u2019s tracking for \u201cEras Tour Book\u201d accounts only for its first weekend sales.",
      "Swift has arranged exclusive, non-traditional releases before. For her \u201cEras\u201d concert film, which came out in 2023, she bypassed Hollywood studios and worked directly with AMC Theatres and Cinemark Theatres. \u201cTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\u201d has made more than $200 million at the box office and stands as the highest grossing concert movie in history.",
      "Even before the \u201cEras\u201d book, Swift has been a mini-genre in the publishing industry, the inspiration for biographies, romance fiction, fashion, coloring books and a cocktail recipe collection, \u201cShake It Up.\u201d Another top seller of 2024, according to Circana, is Wendy Loggia's \u201cTaylor Swift: A Little Golden Book Biography,\u201d designed in the tradition of such Little Golden favorites as \u201cThe Three Bears\u201d and \u201cThe Whispering Rabbit.\u201d"

      "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment.",
      "Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent.",
      "Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city\u2019s picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was.",
      "For years, \u201cwe saw the OFF signs, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. \u201cOnly the artists knew among themselves what was going on.\u201d",
      "Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country\u2019s culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets.",
      "But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status.",
      "So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second.",
      "It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said.",
      "Designers Kemi Bass\u00e8ne and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans \u2014 a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer \u2014 to interpret the theme of \u201chippo.\u201d",
      "They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water.",
      "The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag.",
      "Papise Kant\u00e9, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell.",
      "\u201cI have been sculpting since I was a young child,\" said Kant\u00e9, who comes from a long line of sculptors. \u201cEvery artist wants to get better.\u201d",
      "But it also gave his work recognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Biennale that people know my work,\" he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, \u201cyou are proud.\"",
      "Bass\u00e8ne, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,\u201d Bass\u00e8ne said. \u201cFor craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cnormal,\u201d he said, to include artisans in the Biennale \u201cif we wanted to try to decolonize a little.\u201d",
      "This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course.",
      "Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese \u2014 including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources.",
      "The theme of this year's Biennale has been \u201cThe Wake,\u201d alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers.",
      "The new government of Senegal has \u201ca transformational agenda,\u201d said Bass\u00e8ne. \u201cI think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.\"",
      "In the meantime, the Soumbedioune artisans have big plans. Dia, the community leader, said that they are planning a collaboration with a local school to manufacture backpacks for students.",
      "His dream, he said, was to expand the production across the whole country so the Senegalese parents \u201cdo not have to buy Chinese products.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have all the know-how,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can produce more.\u201d",

      "UNESCO has inscribed ethnic Slovak na\u00efve paintings from a village in Serbia on its list of intangible cultural heritage",
      "KOVACICA, Serbia -- Nearly a century ago, two farmers in an ethnic Slovak village in northern Serbia started painting to pass the time during the long winter months. This week, their art is being inscribed on UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list.",
      "The farmers' paintings and those of others from the village of Kovacica are what is known as na\u00efve art \u2014 a form that depicts everyday scenes, landscapes, village life and farm surroundings with a childlike simplicity.",
      "With their bright colors and folk motives, the self-taught na\u00efve painters of Kovacica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Belgrade, Serbia's capital, have developed a unique tradition among the country's ethnic Slovak minority.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve art in Kovacica began in 1939 when Martin Paluska and Jan Sokol started painting,\u201d explained Ana Zolnaj Barca, the head of the Gallery of Na\u00efve Art in the village. \u201cThey were farmers with only four grades of elementary school.\u201d",
      "Paluska and Sokol initially painted scenes they saw on postcards, such as Venetian gondolas or wild animals, explained Zolnaj Barca. But their art really bloomed over time, when they turned to their own surroundings rather than far-away lands, she said.",
      "The village's na\u00efve art gallery, established in 1955, now holds the works of nearly 50 recognized artists and hosts some 20,000 visitors each year.",
      "Among its most famous artists is Zuzana Chalupova, who often painted children and whose work was featured on millions of UNICEF postcards. Another Kovacica artist, Martin Jonas, depicted farmers with oversized hands and feet but small heads \u2014 meant to symbolize their hard-working life.",
      "And though the Kovacica style of na\u00efve paintings originated in the village, it has since spread far beyond the area.",
      "\u201cAn identifying factor, the practice is a means of transmitting the cultural heritage and history of the Slovak community in Serbia,\u201d UNESCO said in its citation.",
      "Serbia\u2019s government said Tuesday that the UNESCO decision to inscribe Kovacica's na\u00efve paintings confirms the Balkan nation\u2019s \u201cpromotion of cultural diversity.\u201d",
      "For gallerist and expert Pavel Babka, na\u00efve art represents a treasure chest of traditional ways and customs \u2014 he points to a painting in his gallery showing a girl in traditional Slovak multi-layered skirt being sent off to church alone for the first time.",
      "Another painting in Babka's gallery features a horse-drawn cart and a yellow house dating back to Austro-Hungarian times, testifying of the long presence of the ethnic Slovak community in what is today Serbia.",
      "Contemporary na\u00efve artists, Babka said, often also seek inspiration in the tales of the past and \u201cwould rather paint a horse than a tractor.\u201d",
      "Artist Stefan Varga, 65, agrees. He said he paints images based on the \u201cstories my grandmother told me from when she was a little girl.\"",

      "Break out your \u201cDune\u201d popcorn bucket: It's time for the best movies of the year",
      "As much as theaters are humming right now, with \u201cWicked\u201d and \u201cMoana 2\" bringing moviegoers by the droves, it's been a fairly bruising movie year.",
      "In between the blockbusters, though, the challenge of not just capturing the attention of audiences but of simply getting to the screen feels more perilous than ever. The year was marked by filmmakers who wagered everything from a $120 million pile ( Francis Ford Coppola's \u201cMegalopolis\u201d ) to their life (the dissident Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof's \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig\").",
      "Considering the paths of the \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d (about Donald Trump's rise in New York) or the Israeli occupation documentary \u201cNo Other Land\u201d (which still lacks a distributor), the question of what gets released was a common and chilling refrain.",
      "That also made the movies that managed their way through \u2014 the ones that told urgent stories or dazzled with originality at a time of sequel stranglehold \u2014 all the more worth celebrating.",
      "Here are The Associated Press\u2019 Film Writers Jake Coyle and Lindsey Bahr's picks for the best movies of 2024:",
      "Was this a great year for movies? The consensus seems to be no, and that may be true. But it did produce some stone-cold masterpieces, none more so than Payal Kapadia\u2019s sublime tale of three women in modern Mumbai. It\u2019s a grittily real movie graced, in equally parts, by keen-eyed documentary and dreamy poetry. Beguilingly, \u201cAll We Imagine As Light\u201d grows more profound as it cleaves further from reality. In theaters.",
      "Like Kapadia, RaMell Ross started out in documentary before bringing a singular eye to narrative film. His adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning novel, about two Black teenagers at an abusive reform school in the Jim Crow South, is shot mostly from the two boys\u2019 first-person perspective. The result is one of the most visually inventive American films of the decade and, just as certainly, one of the richest in empathy. Opens in theaters Dec. 13.",
      "So many of the reasons to go to the movies \u2014 to laugh at a clattering comic set piece, to witness the breakthrough of a young performer, to be devastated by something tragic \u2014 are contained within the thrillingly kitchen-sink \u201cAnora.\u201d It\u2019s a concoction that only Sean Baker could conceive, let alone execute. (And, by the way, if you liked Yura Borisov\u2019s performance alongside Mikey Madison, seek out 2021\u2019s \u201cCompartment No. 6.\u201d) In theaters.",
      "Jane Schoenbrun\u2019s sophomore feature \u2014 a dramatic leap forward for filmmaker and a transfixing trans parable \u2014 is a chilling 1990s coming of age in which a \u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\u201d-like series called \u201cThe Pink Opaque\u201d offers a possible portal out of drab suburban life and other suffocations. It feels chillingly, beautifully ripped out of Schoenbrun\u2019s soul \u2014 and it\u2019s got a killer soundtrack. Streaming on Max, available for digital rental.",
      "The fury of Agnieszka Holland\u2019s searing migrant drama is suitably calibrated to the crisis. Along the Poland-Belarus border, a small band of migrants from Syria and Afghanistan are sent back and forth across a wooded borderland \u2014 sometimes they're even literally tossed \u2014 in a grim game of \u201cnot in my backyard.\u201d It\u2019s not an easy movie to watch, nor should it be. To keep up with the times, more uncomfortable movies like this may be needed. Streaming on Kino Film Collection, available for digital rental.",
      "We also need more big, fun movies with Ryan Gosling. David Leitch\u2019s affectionate ode to stunt performers manages to celebrate behind-the-scenes crew members while simultaneously being completely carried by two of our most winning movie stars in Gosling and Emily Blunt. The societal value of watching Gosling cry to Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cAll Too Well\u201d should not be underestimated. Streaming on Peacock, available for digital rental.",
      "The way the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof, who was forced into exile while editing this, condenses real-life social upheaval into a family drama makes this a uniquely disquieting film. Like Kurosawa\u2019s \u201cStray Dog,\u201d Rasoulof\u2019s movie centers around a lost handgun. The subsequent search reveals just how deeply the Iranian government's policies have seeped into the most intimate relationships. In theaters.",
      "We had not one but two movies this year that captured the therapeutic properties of theater. Each, almost unbelievably, deftly eludes tipping into cliche thanks to abiding compassion and authenticity in the performances. Alex Thompson and Kelly O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s \u201cGhostlight\u201d is about a grieving father, a construction worker (an exceptional Keith Kupferer), who reluctantly joins a local production of \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d \u201cSing Sing\u201d dramatizes a real rehabilitation prison program. Its screening at Sing Sing Correctional, where many of its performers were once incarcerated, was easily the most moving moviegoing experience of the year for me. \u201cGhostlight\u201d is available for digital rental. \u201cSing Sing\u201d returns to theaters Jan. 17.",
      "In Azazel Jacobs\u2019 funny, tender and raw family drama, a flawless cast of Carrie Coon, Elizabeth Olsen and Natasha Lyonne play three sisters caring for their dying father. In close quarters and with death looming, it all comes out. Streaming on Netflix.",
      "In between large, lengthy epics, Martin Scorsese has made some his most interesting and personal films. In this, Scorsese narrates for director David Hinton his lifetime journey with the films of Powell and Pressburger, the great filmmakers of \u201cThe Red Shoes,\u201d \u201cI Know Where I\u2019m Going!\u201d and \u201cBlack Narcissus.\u201d As an expression of movie love \u2014 of the power of film to transfix you, to change your life, to live alongside you as you grow older \u2014 \u201cMade in England\u201d could hardly be more effusive. Such insightful, passionate testimonies are an increasingly necessary lifeblood in a film culture where algorithms are typically blind to the treasures of cinema\u2019s past. Streaming on WatchTCM and available for digital rental.",
      "Also: \u201cGrand Tour,\u201d \u201cErnest Cole: Lost and Found,\u201d\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d\u201cRebel Ridge,\u201d\u201cThe Brutalist,\u201d\u201cBetween the Temples,\u201d\u201cEvil Does Not Exist,\u201d \u201cUniversal Language,\u201d \u201cDaughters\u201d",
      "Steve McQueen tells a different kind of World War II story in \u201cBlitz,\u201d a powerful and clear-eyed odyssey through London during the German bombing raid. Structured around a 9-year-old boy (Elliott Heffernan) trying to make his way back to his mother (Saoirse Ronan), it is a sneakily revolutionary glimpse into and poignant elegy for worlds unexplored and stories untold. Streaming on Apple TV+.",
      "Poetic and transportive, Kapadia\u2019s Mumbai-set film explores the vibrations of a thrilling but brutally impersonal metropolis, the lives of three women in different stages and predicaments (forbidden love, loneliness, eviction) and delicacy of female friendships.",
      "Josh Margolin\u2019s debut feature about a 90-something (played by the incomparable June Squibb ) on a mission to get $10,000 back from a scammer is so modest in scope and effortlessly enjoyable that it\u2019s easy to undervalue. This independent film feels as sharp and put-together as a yesteryear studio comedy. It\u2019s pure joy and one of those movies you could recommend to anyone. Streaming on Hulu.",
      "It takes a special kind of movie to transcend the echo chamber of arthouse cinephelia and become a cultural moment, but Baker\u2019s \u201cAnora\u201d did it. A classic in waiting, Baker and his star Mikey Madison, who lifts the streetwise stripper trope, take audiences on an unforgettable ride in this fairy tale that falls apart in spectacular fashion.",
      "Ross transforms Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer-winning novel about the abuses and generational trauma of a reform school in the Jim Crow South for the screen by employing first-person point-of-view. It\u2019s a bold choice that pays off, transporting you into the heartbreaking reality of Elwood and Turner, two characters you won\u2019t soon forget.",
      "Decades of dreaming about a film does not always seem to benefit said film, but Denis Villeneuve was able to translate his passion for Frank Herbert\u2019s opus into pure cinematic spectacle, and doom, about the rise of a leader. It\u2019s a grand and thrilling adventure that could make sci-fi nerds out of us all. Streaming on MAX.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg grapples with modern and historical trauma in the disarmingly entertaining road trip film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d which he wrote, directed and stars in alongside Kieran Culkin as cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland. In theaters.",
      "Saoirse Ronan delivered one of the year\u2019s absolute best performances as an alcoholic who goes further and further into seclusion in the Orkney Islands in an attempt to start life anew. Films about addiction are hardly novel, and yet Nora Fingscheidt captures the wild highs, lows and in-betweens of the human condition with unapologetic honesty. Available for digital rental.",
      "Ry\u00fbsuke Hamaguchi\u2019s follow-up to \u201cDrive My Car\u201d takes us to a small mountain village in Japan, where residents are hesitant to welcome a big city company with plans to set up a glamping site. It\u2019s a slow-burn kind of experience, with community debates about mountain streams and septic tanks that might not sound terribly exciting and yet it\u2019s one of the year\u2019s most haunting and effective. Streaming on Criterion Channel, available for digital rental.",
      "It was a great year for first-time directors, including India Donaldson whose quietly brilliant character study of a teenage girl on a camping trip with her dad and his friend resonates even a year later. Streaming on Apple TV+",
      "Also: \u201cThe Taste of Things\u201d; \u201cGreen Border\u201d; \u201cChallengers\u201d; \u201dBeetlejuice Beetlejuice \u201d; \u201cLa Cocina\u201d; \u201cWill & Harper\u201d; \u201dConclave\u201d; \u201cMaria\u201d; \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea\u201d; \u201cTuesday\u201d; \u201cLee\u201d."

      "Ros\u00e9, the nightingale of the massively popular Korean girl group Blackpink, has flown the nest and launched her first solo album \u201cRosie.\u201d She\u2019s the first of the awesome foursome to release a full-length solo record, and in English at that. Members Jisoo and Jennie have previously released singles, and Lisa is gearing up for her own studio album in 2025.",
      "Across \u201cRosie,\u201d titled after Ros\u00e9's nickname to communicate a kind of personal intimacy, the singer goes to great lengths to detach herself sonically from her band. Unlike Blackpink\u2019s high energy electro-pop output, Ros\u00e9\u2019s solo material is that of a coffee-house dweller with a sideline in romantic drama. But don't expect finger-plucked acoustic guitar balladry exclusively \u2014 \u201cRosie\u201d is reserved in some moments, full of life in others.",
      "The album starts off chipper, with the soaring piano ballad \u201cNumber One Girl,\u201d the cool synth-pop track \u201cTwo Years,\u201d the dynamic, catchy Bruno Mars collaboration \u201cApt.,\u201d and the contemporary, Taylor Swift-indebted pop of \u201cToxic Till the End.\" But it invariably slows down, preferring fairly stripped back production throughout. She\u2019s got the voice and she\u2019s flaunting it; it\u2019s her prerogative to showcase her range at the expense of a more energetic beat.",
      "Across 12-tracks, the album studies heartache over lost loves (\u201cIt\u2019s been two years and you\u2019re still not gone/It doesn\u2019t make sense that I can\u2019t move on,\u201d she sings on \u201cTwo Years\u201d), missed chances (\u201cAre we lovers or friends/'Cause it\u2019s as good as it gets\u201d in \u201cCall it the End\u201d) and ambivalence over situationships that probably should've been nipped in the bud but staggered along, strung by the power of lust and not much else. (That one is everywhere \u2014 particularly in the dubious boyfriends of \u201cToxic Till the End\u201d and \u201cGameboy.\u201d) Who can't relate?",
      "The album is an emotional rollercoaster easy to empathize with, stuffed with songs that articulate the trials and tribulations of early adult years \u2014 the search for connection and getting dragged into romances that lead nowhere. But throughout, fans of both Blackpink and Ros\u00e9 might miss the spirited songs of her group. After all \u2014 your 20s are for partying, too \u2014 not just heartbreak.",

      "The global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end after the popstar performed more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- After more than 150 shows across five continents over nearly two years, the global phenomenon that is Taylor Swift\u2019s Eras Tour is coming to an end.",
      "There is no simple way to encapsulate the effects of Swift\u2019s decision to put on a 3 \u00bd-hour concert, showcasing 44 songs representing 10 different \u201ceras\u201d of her career \u2014 a feat she kicked off in March 2023 and will end Sunday in Vancouver, Canada. The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note.",
      "But for many who attended the concerts, and the millions more who eagerly watched fan-broadcasted livestreams on their screens, the tour also became a beacon of joy \u2014 a chance not only to appreciate Swift's expansive music career, but also celebrate the yearslong journey fans have taken with her.",
      "\u201cRight now we have this special designated time to be together, talk about the show and hang out,\u201d said Tess Bohne, a stay-at-home mom of three turned content creator dedicated to livestreaming Swift\u2019s concerts \u2014 by attending herself or coordinating with others to highlight their streams. \u201cFor some, it\u2019s their therapy.\u201d",
      "Bohne, who has earned the title among the Swiftie community as the \u201clivestream queen,\u201d says she often interacts with fans hosting parties to watch an Eras concert live at home with their closest friends. People have also made lasting friendships as they geek out together watching the show from afar.",
      "Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There\u2019s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine your favorite sports team,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cThey\u2019re still a team, but they\u2019re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That\u2019s going to leave a hole for some folks.\u201d",
      "Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool.",
      "\u201cThis is the very first time I\u2019ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cthis tour has really become my entire life.\u201d Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end.",
      "Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada.",
      "By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, \u201cSpeak Now \u201d and 2014's record \u201c1989,\u201d as well as released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,\u201d said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. \u201cAnd this is a woman that owning it, she\u2019s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women\u2019s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.\"",
      "Even the word \u201cera\u201d has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases \u2014 are you in your \u201cvillain era\u201d or a \u201chealing era\u201d?",
      "\u201cI think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,\u201d said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. \u201cWhether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she\u2019s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she\u2019s achieved a level where it\u2019s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.\u201d",
      "Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer \u2014 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides \u2014 passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.",
      "And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows.",
      "\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\u201d Swift later wrote in a statement. \u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\u201d",
      "Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets \u2014 which also became an iconic feature of the shows \u2014 on a nearby tree.",
      "Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences \u2014 both old and new.",
      "\u201cI feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,\u201d Wong said of Swifties. \u201cNow the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.\u201d",

The list also provides a retrospective of the year\u2019s most discussed topics and people, from pop culture to politics.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a nice way to kind of look back into the year and see everything that has happened,\u201d said Esteban Touma, a linguistic and cultural expert at Babbel.",
      "Roan \u2014 whose hits include \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d \u2014 shot to fame this year and is nominated for six Grammy awards. According to the list, her name is pronounced CHAP-uhl ROHN, not SHA-pel ROW-an.",
      "During Harris' unsuccessful run for president this year, her great-nieces took to the stage at the Democratic National Convention to clear up how to say her first name, pronounced COM-a-la. Also making the list was U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, whose last name still leaves people tongue-tied. During his 2020 presidential run, his campaign made posters and T-shirts with the pronunciation \u201cBoot-Edge-Edge\u201d to help.",
      "Other words on the list include:",
      "\u2014 Dutch Kooikerhondje, pronounced COY-ker-HUND-che, is a breed of dog that made it's way into the lexicon this year. This is largely because Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani has a Kooikerhondje called Decoy who won the hearts of fans while delivering a ceremonial first pitch.",

      "Nancy Niedzielski, chair of the linguistics department at Rice University in Houston, points out that most of the words on the list are not English, so it\u2019s not surprising that they would be mispronounced in the U.S. The key to pronouncing them correctly, she said, would probably just be hearing them spoken.",

      "\u2019Tis the season to unpack Spotify Wrapped",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 'Tis the season to unpack Spotify Wrapped. And it should come as no surprise that for a second year in a row, Taylor Swift has been named its most-played artist.",
      "On Wednesday, the streaming giant unveiled its annual overview of individual listening trends as well as trends from around the world. Users can now access their top artists, songs, genres, albums and podcasts, as well as uncover which artists had the biggest year on the platform.",
      "Swift was 2024\u2019s most-streamed artist globally, ranking in more than 26.6 billion streams. She's followed by The Weeknd, Bad Bunny, Drake and Billie Eilish, in that order.",
      "In the U.S., the list looks similar: It's Swift in the top spot, followed by Drake, Zach Bryan, Morgan Wallen and Kanye West.",
      "Last year, Swift dethroned Puerto Rican reggaet\u00f3n star Bad Bunny for the top spot, globally. He held the coveted title for three years in a row beginning in 2020.",
      "Swift also earned the title of most-streamed album in 2024, with \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d She's followed by Eilish's \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d Sabrina Carpenter's \u201cShort n' Sweet,\" Karol G's \u201cMa\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito\u201d and Ariana Grande's \u201ceternal sunshine.\u201d",
      "All of those titles are new to 2024 with the exception of Karol G's album, which released early last year.",
      "In the U.S., there are only slight differences: Swift's album still leads, followed by Wallen's \u201cOne Thing At A Time\u201d \u2014 released last year. Then it's Carpenter, Noah Kahan's \u201cStick Season,\u201d and Chappell Roan's \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,\u201d also released in 2023.",
      "Carpenter leads the most-streamed songs both in the U.S. and globally this year, with her summertime smash \u201cEspresso.\u201d It earned over 1.6 billion streams.",
      "Globally, she's followed by Benson Boone's \u201cBeautiful Things,\u201d Eilish's \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d FloyyMenor and Cris MJ's \u201cGata Only\u201d and Teddy Swims' \u201cLose Control.\u201d",
      "And in the U.S., she's trailed by Kendrick Lamar's \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Shaboozey's \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d, Post Malone and Morgan Wallen's \u201cI Had Some Help\u201d and Tommy Richman's \u201cMillion Dollar Baby.\u201d",
      "This year, there are a few new features on Spotify Wrapped. Those include a new data story called \u201cYour Music Evolution,\u201d documenting three distinct musical phases for each user, and a personalized playlist. The individualized \"Your Top Artist\" feature has changed slightly, too, and now includes \u201cLongest Listening Streak\" as well as the familiar \u201cTop Listeners.\u201d",
      "On social media, some Spotify users complained that Wrapped, which undergoes design changes every year, was minimalist this year, missing previous features like \u201cTop Cities,\u201d \u201cAudio Auras\u201d and \u201cTop Genres.\u201d The new \u201cYour Music Evolution\u201d feature, however, provides users with individual, created micro-genres for some months of listening.",
      "A representative for Spotify did not provide a statement.",
      "That the biggest artists, globally, earned top spots on Spotify Wrapped should come as no surprise \u2014 they\u2019re featured prominently across the streaming service, including on its highly influential playlists, in addition to boasting loyal, dedicated fanbases. For independent artists who may appear on an individual listener\u2019s Wrapped, accessing a top spot on the global list would require billions of streams.",
      "Streaming now accounts for most of the money generated by the music industry \u2014 a whopping 84% in the United States, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and 67.3% worldwide, according to a 2024 report by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which tracks global sales.",
      "Spotify is the largest platform of all \u2014 making up roughly 31% of the total market share \u2014 with a reported 626 million users and 246 million subscribers in over 180 markets.",

      "A judge is weighing which of Missouri's sweeping abortion restrictions will fall under a new constitutional amendment",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Abortion-rights advocates on Wednesday asked a judge to overturn Missouri\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure, less than a month after voters backed an abortion-rights constitutional amendment.",
      "Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang did not immediately rule after the hearing. Planned Parenthood and other plaintiffs had asked her to issue a temporary order blocking enforcement of Missouri\u2019s numerous abortion laws.",
      "Emily Wales, the president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said abortions could begin Friday in clinics in Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis if the judge issues the order.",
      "\u201cEvery single day that they cannot access abortion rights they are being denied critical care,\" Wales said of Missouri residents.",
      "Several anti-abortion protesters knelt on the ground as they prayed outside the courthouse during the hearing. They covered their mouths with a red piece of tape that read \u201clife.\u201d",
      "Missouri is one of five states where voters approved ballot measures this year to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "Reproductive rights advocates in Arizona on Tuesday sued to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with that state's new constitutional amendment expanding access up to fetal viability.",
      "The Missouri amendment does not specifically override any state laws. Instead the measure leaves it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, an abortion opponent, last week issued an opinion agreeing that most abortions will be legal when the amendment takes effect Thursday.",
      "But Bailey\u2019s office is still fighting for a ban on most abortions after viability, along with a number of regulations that Planned Parenthood argues made it nearly impossible to offer abortions in the state even before abortion was almost completely banned in 2022.",
      "Missouri\u2019s constitutional amendment allows lawmakers to restrict abortion after viability, with exceptions to \u201cprotect the life or physical or mental health of the pregnant person.\u201d",
      "The term \u201cviability\u201d is used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame, doctors say it is sometime after the 21st week of pregnancy.",
      "Other abortion laws that Bailey is defending include a 72-hour waiting period before an abortion can be performed; bans on abortions based on race, sex or a possible Down syndrome diagnosis; and a requirement that medical facilities that provide abortions be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers.",
      "Missouri Solicitor General Josh Divine argued in court that the right to reproductive freedom includes the right to childbirth, which he said supports laws such as the state's 72-hour waiting period.",
      "\u201cThose laws are enabling childbirth,\u201d he said. \"They are giving time to choose childbirth.\u201d",
      "But Planned Parenthood Federation of America attorney Ella Spottswood during the hearing told the judge that by 2019, the slew of Missouri laws regulating abortion had effectively limited access to a single St. Louis clinic.",
      "\u201cThe voters have changed all that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe questions should begin and end with the amendment.\u201d",
      "It is unclear when Zhang will rule on the request for a preliminary injunction.",

      "NEW YORK -- Investigators are searching for clues that could help them identify the masked gunman who stalked and killed the leader of one of the largest U.S. health insurance companies on a Manhattan sidewalk, then disappeared into Central Park.",
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, 50, died in a dawn ambush Wednesday as he walked to the company's annual investor conference at a Hilton in Midtown, blocks from tourist draws like Radio City Music Hall and the Museum of Modern Art.",
      "The killing, and the shooter's movements in the minutes before and afterward, were captured on some of the multitudes of security cameras present in that part of the city.",
      "One video showed him approach Thompson from behind, level his pistol and fire several shots, barely pausing to clear a brief gun jam while the dying health executive tumbled to the pavement.",
      "Other security cameras captured the initial stages of the gunman's escape. He was seen fleeing the block across a pedestrian plaza, then escaping on a bicycle into Central Park, where he vanished.",
      "Police used drones, helicopters and dogs in an intense search, but the killer's whereabouts remained unknown late into the night.",
      "New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that while investigators had not yet established a motive, the shooting was no random act of violence.",
      "\u201cMany people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,\u201d Tisch said at a news conference Wednesday.",
      "\u201cFrom watching the video, it does seem that he\u2019s proficient in the use of firearms as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,\u201d NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "Police issued several surveillance images of the man, who wore a hooded jacket and a mask that concealed most of his face and wouldn't have attracted attention on a frigid winter day. Some of the photos were taken at a Starbucks coffee shop shortly before the shooting.",
      "The police department offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",

      "Eric Werner, the police chief in the Minneapolis suburb where Thompson lived, said his department had not received any reports of threats against the executive.",
      "Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cellphone from the alleyway through which the shooter fled. They were also searching Thompson's hotel room, interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues and reviewing his social media, Kenny said.",
      "Police initially said the shooter rode into Central Park on a bicycle from the city\u2019s bike-share program, CitiBike. But a spokesperson for the program\u2019s operator, Lyft, said police officials informed the company Wednesday afternoon that the bike was not from the CitiBike fleet.",
      "Health care giant UnitedHealth Group was holding its annual meeting with investors to update Wall Street on the company's direction and expectations for the coming year. The company ended the conference early in the wake of Thompson's death.",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons, had been with the company since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",

      "Raw Farm, of Fresno, voluntarily recalled all whole milk and cream products from stores late Tuesday after tests found bird flu virus in \u201cmultiple\u201d retail samples and dairy storage and bottling sites. The recall covers all Raw Farm milk and cream produced between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27.",
      "The California Department of Food and Agriculture quarantined the farm and suspended distribution of raw milk, cream, kefir, butter and cheese products produced on or after Nov. 27.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are strongly encouraged not to consume any raw milk or cream products in their possession or still on store shelves,\u201d officials said in a statement.",
      "The move followed recalls of two lots of Raw Farm products after bird flu was first detected in retail milk on Nov. 21.",
      "No known cases of bird flu virus have been confirmed in people who drank raw milk, health officials said. Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to kill the virus and remains safe to drink.",
      "Pet owners also should avoid feeding Raw Farm products sold nationwide as \u201cpet food topper\u201d or \u201cpet food kefir\u201d to their animals, who can become ill, health officials said. Cats on farms with infected cows have developed brain damage and died after drinking contaminated raw milk.",
      "Bird flu virus, also known as Type A H5N1 avian influenza, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cows in March. The virus has been spreading rapidly, particularly in California, where nearly 500 of the more than 700 infected U.S. herds have been detected.",
      "The virus has infected 57 people in the U.S. this year, including 31 in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mild illnesses have been seen in dairy and poultry workers who had close contact with infected animals. In two cases, an adult in Missouri and a child in California, no known source of the illnesses have been identified. No cases of bird flu spreading between people have been detected in the U.S.",
      "Health officials have long warned against drinking raw milk because it can contain germs that cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening.",
      "Raw Farm\u2019s owner, Mark McAfee, has called for less raw milk regulation. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, farm officials said they were working to restore supply quickly.",
      "\u201cThere are no illnesses associated with H5N1 in our products. But rather this is a political issue,\u201d the post said. \u201cThere are no food safety issues with our products or consumer safety. We are working towards resolving this political issue while being cooperative with our government regulatory agencies.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been tapped as the nation's top health official, has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk. McAfee told The Associated Press that Kennedy is a customer of his products. Kennedy has criticized agriculture departments for cracking down on raw milk and promised that the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s \u201c aggressive suppression \u201d of unpasteurized milk would end under President-elect Donald Trump.",

      "At least 26 states have adopted laws restricting or banning such care for minors, and most of those states face lawsuits.",
      "Here's the latest:",

      "The arguments in front of the justices wrapped up after more than two hours.",
      "\u201cOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here,\u201d Rice said.",

      "Strangio cited laws against cross-dressing and previous bans on military service by transgender people.",
      "President Joe Biden in 2021 reversed a Trump-era policy that largely barred transgender people from serving in the military. Trump has indicated he plans to reinstate that ban when he takes office in January.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution leaves that question to the people\u2019s representatives, rather than to 9 people, none of whom is a doctor,\u201d Roberts said in questioning Strangio.",
      "Strangio notes that multiple studies show the care reduces the risk of depression and suicidality.",
      "Transgender youth in the United States have been flooding crisis hotlines since the election of Donald Trump, who made anti-transgender themes central to his campaign.",

She was equally skeptical that the court should for the first time declare that discrimination against transgender people should be viewed as similar to bias based on race, sex and national origin, all of which have a special legal status.",
      "Barrett said transgender people have not experienced the same long history of discrimination written into the law in the same way those other groups faced.",
      "\u201cAll other suspect classes do have that long de jure history of discrimination,\u201d Barrett said, using the Latin phrase for \u201caccording to law.\u201d",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has coached his daughters\u2019 youth basketball teams, asked about the impact of a ruling on gender-affirming care in that realm.",
      "\u201cIf you prevail here on the standard of review, what would that mean for women and girls sports?\u201d he asked. \u201cWould transgender athletes have a constitutional right to participate in girls\u2019 sports?\u201d",
      "At least 24 states have adopted restrictions on transgender women and girls in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports competitions. There have also been legal challenges to those laws, with mixed verdicts so far.",

      "\u201cWe do think there is a real space for states to regulate here,\u201d Prelogar said.",
      "She pointed to West Virginia\u2019s as one that might fare better because it gives a path for treatment for teens who are considered by medical providers to be at risk for self-harm or suicide.",
      "During questioning by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, Prelogar noted that every major medical organization has supported gender-affirming care for transgender youth, and many have filed briefs supporting the challenge to Tennessee\u2019s law.",
      "\u201cSome children suffer incredibly with gender dysphoria, some attempt suicide,\u201d Sotomayor said.",
      "The groups include the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Justices Thomas and Alito both asked about when the states can and cannot have sex-based laws.",
      "\u201cWe think the court just needs to recognize the sex-based classification and send this case back,\u201d Prelogar said, adding that the treatments can be \u201ccritical, sometimes lifesaving, care to individuals with severe gender dysphoria.\u201d",
      "Tennessee\u2019s law bars puberty blockers and hormone treatment only for transgender minors.",
      "The votes of Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Amy Coney Barrett probably will decide this case.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at where the Justices stand:",
      "Roberts and Gorsuch joined the court\u2019s liberal justices (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) in the 2020 workplace discrimination case won by LGBTQ+ plaintiffs.",

One additional potential cause for delay is the Trump administration could weigh in soon after he takes office. It\u2019s not clear how that might affect the case.",

      "The Supreme Court\u2019s only other major case on transgender rights was in 2020 when the court ruled that workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ people was sex discrimination in violation of the federal civil rights law commonly known as Title VII.",
      "The court concluded in separate cases involving a gay man and a transgender woman that they were discriminated against because of their sex. Justice Neil Gorsuch, an appointee of Donald Trump\u2019s in his first term in the White House, wrote the 6-3 opinion for the court. Chief Justice John Roberts was the only other conservative member of the court in the majority.",
      "The nation\u2019s top court will be weighing whether Tennessee\u2019s law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Both sides in the case claim they are acting to protect minors from harm.",
      "Transgender attorney Chase Strangio will represent families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban leaves them terrified for the future and that access to this kind of care is life-saving.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely."

      "A study shows blood tests that check for fetal disorders can sometimes hint at cancer in pregnant women",
      "Many moms-to-be opt for blood tests during pregnancy to check for fetal disorders such as Down syndrome. In rare instances, these tests can reveal something unexpected \u2014 hints of a hidden cancer in the woman.",
      "In a study of 107 pregnant women whose test results were unusual, 52 were ultimately diagnosed with cancer. Most of them were treated and are now in remission, although seven with advanced cancers died.",
      "\"They looked like healthy, young women and they reported themselves as being healthy,\u201d said Dr. Diana Bianchi, the senior author of the government study published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.",
      "Of the discovered cancers, lymphoma blood cancers were the most common, followed by colon and breast cancers.",
      "The blood test is called cell-free DNA sequencing. It looks for fetal problems in DNA fragments shed from the placenta into the mother\u2019s bloodstream. It also can pick up DNA fragments shed by cancer cells.",
      "Of the millions of pregnant women each year who have a cell-free DNA test, 1 in 10,000 will get a result back that is unusual and difficult to interpret, neither positive or negative for a fetal abnormality. This small number of people \u2014 perhaps only 250 a year in the U.S. \u2014 may be at risk for cancer.",
      "\u201cThey and their care providers need to take the results seriously and have additional testing because in that population there is a 48% risk of cancer,\u201d said Bianchi, who leads the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.",
      "The study looked at what should be done next, and the researchers concluded that it's best to do a whole-body MRI to look for cancer. A physical exam or taking a family history is not enough, Bianchi said.",
      "About five years ago, commercial labs that do these tests and doctors started telling women with unusual results about the study. The National Institutes of Health paid for study volunteers to travel to its research hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, where the participants had their family and medical histories reviewed, a complete physical examination, whole-body MRI scans and other tests performed.",
      "The research identified a recognizable \u201cvery chaotic\u201d pattern in the DNA sequencing of the women diagnosed with cancer, Bianchi said. The study is continuing to look for more evidence to indicate who should be screened for cancer.",
      "Many medical groups now recommend offering cell-free DNA tests during pregnancy, though many expectant parents decide against the optional test. Considered reliable for detecting Down syndrome and two other disorders, the tests have come under scrutiny for too many false alarms for extremely rare fetal problems.",
      "The new finding will help educate doctors about a rare result of DNA tests in pregnancy, said Dr. Neeta Vora, director of reproductive genetics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who wrote an editorial in the journal.",
      "Doctors who care for pregnant women are not accustomed to ordering whole-body MRI tests, Vora said, and these scans, which can cost $1,000 to $2,000, may not be covered by health insurance.",

Roy Cooper said on Wednesday while celebrating the one-year anniversary of expansion in the state.",
      "As of Wednesday, 590,331 people were enrolled in Medicaid expansion in North Carolina, according to the Division of Health Benefits. At the expansion's start on Dec. 1, 2023, Cooper\u2019s administration had estimated the state would reach 600,000 within two years.",
      "Speaking in Greenville with leaders of East Carolina University\u2019s health care system and medical school, Cooper recognized expansion and other health care initiatives advanced during his two terms as governor.

      "Republicans in charge of the General Assembly opposed the idea for years. As Congress offered states additional financial incentives to participate, the GOP-controlled legislature and Cooper ultimately enacted an expansion law in 2023, making North Carolina one but a few Southern states to date to accept the coverage. The federal government pays 90% of the cost of expansion, with the remainder paid in North Carolina by an increased assessment on hospitals.",

      "Cooper's office billed the event as the first in a series this month to highlight the departing governor's accomplishments.",
      "The news release mentioned a first-of-its-kind initiative this year that will give almost 100 hospitals higher Medicaid payments if medical debt of low- and middle-income patients is relieved and they implement policies that prevent liabilities for future patients.

      "Quoting from the 57-year-old decision, Jackson noted that Virginia argued then that \u201cthe scientific evidence is substantially in doubt and, consequently, the court should defer to the wisdom of the state legislature.\u201d",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the majority opinion in 2020, said nothing during the arguments.",
      "The arguments produced some riveting moments. Justice Samuel Alito repeatedly pressed Strangio, the first openly transgender lawyer to argue at the nation's highest court, about whether transgender people should be legally designated as a group that\u2019s susceptible to discrimination.",
      "Strangio answered that being transgender does fit that legal definition, though he acknowledged under Alito\u2019s questioning there are a small number of people who de-transition. \u201cSo it's not an immutable characteristic, is it?\u201d Alito said.",
      "Strangio did not retreat from his view, though he said the court did not have to decide the issue to resolve the case in his clients' favor.",
      "There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court\u2019s marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters,\u201d while the other side proclaimed \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves.\"",
      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law urged the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, called the law sex-based line drawing to ban the use of drugs that have been safely prescribed for decades and said the state \u201cdecided to completely override the views of the patients, the parents, the doctors.\u201d",
      "She contrasted the Tennessee law with one enacted by West Virginia, which set conditions for the health care for transgender minors, but stopped short of an outright ban.",
      "Rice countered that lawmakers acted to regulate \u201crisky, unproven medical interventions\u201d and, at one point, likened the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments to lobotomies and eugenics, now thoroughly discredited but once endorsed by large segments of the medical community.",
      "Rice argued that the Tennessee law doesn\u2019t discriminate based on sex, but rather based on the purpose of the treatment. Children can get puberty blockers to treat early onset puberty, but not as a treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "\u201cOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here,\u201d Rice said.",
      "While the challengers invoked the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relied on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",
      "If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it. That's the course Prelogar and Strangio pushed for on Wednesday, though there did not seem to be much support for it.",
      "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "But Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh all highlighted a point made by Tennessee in its legal briefs claiming that health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "If those countries \u201care pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" Kavanaugh said, why should the Supreme Court question Tennessee's actions?",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar said.",
      "Kavanaugh, who has coached his daughters\u2019 youth basketball teams, also wondered whether a ruling against Tennessee would give transgender athletes \"a constitutional right to participate in girls' sports.\u201d",
      "Prelogar said a narrow decision would not affect the sports issue.",

      "UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO has been shot and killed in what police say is a \u201cbrazen, targeted attack\u201d outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference",
      "NEW YORK -- A gunman killed UnitedHealthcare\u2019s CEO on Wednesday in a \u201cbrazen, targeted attack\u201d outside a Manhattan hotel where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, police said, setting off a massive search for the fleeing assailant hours before the annual Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting nearby.",
      "Brian Thompson, 50, was shot around 6:45 a.m. as he walked alone to the New York Hilton Midtown from a nearby hotel, police said. The shooter appeared to be \u201clying in wait for several minutes\u201d before approaching Thompson from behind and opening fire, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said. Police had not yet established a motive.",
      "\u201cMany people passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,\u201d Tisch said, adding that the shooting \"does not appear to be a random act of violence.\u201d",
      "Surveillance video reviewed by investigators shows someone emerging from behind a parked car, pointing a gun at Thompson\u2019s back, then firing multiple times from several feet away. The gunman continues firing, interrupted by a brief gun jam, as Thompson stumbles forward and falls to the sidewalk. He then walks past Thompson and out of the frame.",
      "\u201cFrom watching the video, it does seem that he\u2019s proficient in the use of firearms as he was able to clear the malfunctions pretty quickly,\u201d NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said.",
      "Thompson was shot at least once in the back and once in the calf, Tisch said.",
      "The shooter, who wore a jacket, face mask and large backpack, fled through Midtown on foot before pedaling an electric bike into Central Park a few blocks away, police said. The assailant remained at large Wednesday afternoon, sparking a search that included police drones, helicopters and dogs.",
      "\u201cBrian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him,\u201d the insurer\u2019s Minnetonka, Minnesota-based parent company, UnitedHealth Group Inc., said in a statement. \"We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time.\u201d",
      "Police issued a poster showing a surveillance image of the man pointing what appeared to be a gun and another image that appeared to show the same person on a bicycle. Minutes before the shooting, he stopped at a nearby Starbucks, according to additional surveillance photos released by police on Wednesday afternoon. They offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Thompson\u2019s wife, Paulette Thompson, told NBC News that he told her \u201cthere were some people that had been threatening him.\u201d She didn\u2019t have details but suggested the threats may have involved issues with insurance coverage.",
      "Eric Werner, the police chief in the Minneapolis suburb where Thompson lived, said his department had not received any reports of threats against the executive.",
      "The killing shook a part of New York City that is normally quiet at that hour, happening about four blocks from where tens of thousands of people were set to gather for Wednesday night\u2019s tree lighting. Police promised extra security for the event.",
      "The hotel is also a short walk from other tourist sites, including the Museum of Modern Art and Radio City Music Hall, and is often dense with office workers and visitors on weekday mornings. Many security cameras are nearby.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re encouraging New Yorkers to go about their daily lives and their daily business but to be alert,\u201d NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said.",
      "Investigators recovered several 9 mm shell casings from outside the hotel and a cellphone from the alleyway through which the shooter fled. They were also searching Thompson's hotel room, interviewing his UnitedHealthcare colleagues and reviewing his social media, Kenny said.",
      "Police initially said the shooter rode into Central Park on a bicycle from the city\u2019s bike-share program, CitiBike. But a spokesperson for the program\u2019s operator, Lyft, said police officials informed the company Wednesday afternoon that the bike was not from the CitiBike fleet.",
      "Health care giant UnitedHealth Group was holding its annual meeting with investors to update Wall Street on the company's direction and expectations for the coming year. The company ended the conference early in the wake of Thompson's death.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m afraid that we \u2014 some of you may know we\u2019re dealing with a very serious medical situation with one of our team members,\u201d a company official told attendees, according to a transcript. \u201cAnd as a result, I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re going to have to bring to a close the event today. ... I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll understand.\u201d",
      "Thompson, a father of two sons, had been with the company since 2004 and served as CEO for more than three years.",

      "Nearly three out of 10 U.S. drugstores that were open during the previous decade had closed by 2021, new research shows.",
      "Black and Latino neighborhoods were most vulnerable to the retail pharmacy closures, which can chip away at already-limited care options in those communities, researchers said in a study published Tuesday in Health Affairs.",
      "The trend has potentially gained momentum since the study's timeframe, because many drugstores are still struggling. In the last three years, the major chains Walgreens and CVS have closed hundreds of additional stores, and Rite Aid shrank as it went through a bankruptcy reorganization.",
      "Drugstores have been dealing with shrinking reimbursement for prescriptions, rising costs and changing customer shopping habits. The chains have been closing money-losing stores and transferring prescription files to more profitable locations.",
      "The study found that more than 29% of the nearly 89,000 retail U.S. pharmacies that operated between 2010 and 2020 had closed by 2021. That amounts to more than 26,000 stores.",
      "Researchers using data from the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs found that the number of U.S. pharmacies had actually increased from 2010 to 2017 because of store openings, but the pace of closings picked up starting in 2018.",
      "They also highlighted which stores were more likely to close. Those include independent pharmacies, which were more likely than chain stores to be in Black, Latino and low-income neighborhoods.",
      "Pharmacies in neighborhoods with higher rates of patients on government-funded Medicaid and Medicare also were at greater risk for closing, said Dima Qato, a University of Southern California pharmacy professor who was the study's lead author. Those programs tend to reimburse less than private health insurance.",
      "Researchers also noted that the exclusion of some pharmacies, particularly independent drugstores, from pharmacy benefit manager networks can hurt. That can mean fewer prescriptions and customers visit for those stores.",
      "Retail drugstores can be important sources for vaccinations, contraception, overdose prevention and opioid use disorder treatments, aside from prescriptions, Qato said. She noted that Black and Latino communities often have fewer pharmacies to begin with, so store closings hit residents of those communities particularly hard.",

      "An official of a union involved in the anti-smoking push on Monday called for the head of the Atlantic City casino workers' union, Donna DeCaprio, to resign for failing to protect her members from the dangers of secondhand smoke.",
      "DeCaprio is president of Local 54 of the Unite Here union, which opposes a smoking ban on the grounds that so much business would be lost by smokers taking their money elsewhere that it could cause one or more casinos to shut down, costing thousands of workers their jobs.",
      "\u201cShe should be ashamed of herself,\u201d said Ray Jensen, assistant director of United Auto Workers Region 9, which represents dealers at three Atlantic City casinos and is part of a lawsuit seeking to have the courts force an end to smoking in the gambling halls. \u201cShe should hand in her union card.\u201d",
      "DeCaprio said her union supports the health and safety of its members, adding improvements to the workplace environment need to be made.",
      "\u201cA balance needs to be reached that will both protect worker health and preserve good jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are protecting our members against multiple casino closures and job losses. The UAW is eager to sacrifice the entire casino industry and put 25,000 good jobs with benefits at risk.\u201d",
      "DeCaprio said between 50% and 72% of all in-person casino revenue in Atlantic City comes from smoking sections, which occupy only 25% of the casino floor.",

      "A majority of Supreme Court justices didn\u2019t seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use",
      "WASHINGTON -- A majority of Supreme Court justices didn't seem convinced Monday that federal regulators misled companies before refusing to allow them to sell sweet-flavored vaping products following a surge in teen e-cigarette use.",
      "The conservative-majority court did raise questions about the Food and Drug Administration crackdown that included denials of more than a million nicotine products formulated to taste like fruit, dessert or candy. Teen vaping use has since dropped to its lowest level in a decade, but the agency could change its approach after the inauguration next month of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised to \u201csave\u201d vaping.",
      "Vaping companies have long marketed their products as a way to help adults quit traditional cigarettes, and say the FDA changed its standards with little warning as it blocked the sale of over a million new flavored products.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan, though, was skeptical.",
      "\u201cI guess I\u2019m not really seeing what the surprise is here,\u201d she said. \u201cYou knew what the FDA\u2019s point of view was ... that blueberry vapes are really problematic in terms of youth smoking.\"",
      "The FDA was slow to regulate the now multibillion-dollar vaping market, and even years into the crackdown flavored vapes that are technically illegal nevertheless remain widely available.",
      "The agency says the companies were denied because they couldn't show flavored vapes had a net public benefit, as laid out in the law. It has approved some tobacco-flavored vapes, and recently allowed its first menthol-flavored electronic cigarettes for adult smokers after the company provided data showing the product was more helpful in quitting, Deputy Solicitor General Curtis Gannon said.",
      "The issue came before the high court when the agency appealed a decision from the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals tossing out one of its denials.",
      "While other lower courts rebuffed vaping company lawsuits, the 5th Circuit sided with Dallas-based company Triton Distribution. The decision allowed the sale of e-juices like \u201cJimmy The Juice Man in Peachy Strawberry\" and \u201cSuicide Bunny Mother's Milk and Cookies\u201d which are heated by an e-cigarette to create an inhalable aerosol.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch questioned whether the FDA process had given the companies a fair chance to make their claims, given that their businesses were at stake.",
      "Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh expressed concern about what recourse companies have if agencies issue misleading guidance, though he also elicited that the FDA wasn't required to issue the guidance it gave in the vaping case. \u201cI'm trying to figure out what the legal error is here,\u201d he said.",
      "The vaping companies, he said, can reapply for sales authorization even if they don't win in court. Triton attorney Eric Heyer said that process would take so long that the company could be forced to close.",
      "The court has overall been skeptical of the power of federal regulators, including by striking down the so-called Chevron doctrine that had judges deferring to agencies' interpretation of the law.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett questioned whether the vaping companies wanted the court to take that concept a step further. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a reverse Chevron deference, except we're deferring to the applicant,\" she said.",
      "The court is expected to decide the case in the coming months.",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 19:06:23 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, falsely claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent",
      "Social media users are misrepresenting a Vermont Supreme Court ruling, claiming that it gives schools permission to vaccinate children even if their parents do not consent.",
      "The ruling addressed a lawsuit filed by Dario and Shujen Politella against Windham Southeast School District and state officials over the mistaken vaccination of their child against COVID-19 in 2021, when he was 6 years old. A lower court had dismissed the original complaint, as well as an amended version. An appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was filed on Nov. 19.",
      "But the ruling by Vermont's high court is not as far-reaching as some online have claimed. In reality, it concluded that anyone protected under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or PREP, Act is immune to state lawsuits.",
      "Here's a closer look at the facts.",
      "CLAIM: The Vermont Supreme Court ruled that schools can vaccinate children against their parents' wishes.",
      "THE FACTS: The claim stems from a July 26 ruling by the Vermont Supreme Court, which found that anyone protected by the PREP Act is immune to state lawsuits, including the officials named in the Politella's suit. The ruling does not authorize schools to vaccinate children at their discretion.",
      "According to the lawsuit, the Politella's son \u2014 referred to as L.P. \u2014 was given one dose of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine at a vaccination clinic held at Academy School in Brattleboro even though his father, Dario, told the school's assistant principal a few days before that his son was not to receive a vaccination. In what officials described as a mistake, L.P. was removed from class and had a \u201chandwritten label\u201d put on his shirt with the name and date of birth of another student, L.K., who had already been vaccinated that day. L.P. was then vaccinated.",
      "Ultimately, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that officials involved in the case could not be sued.",
      "\u201cWe conclude that the PREP Act immunizes every defendant in this case and this fact alone is enough to dismiss the case,\u201d the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling reads. \u201cWe conclude that when the federal PREP Act immunizes a defendant, the PREP Act bars all state-law claims against that defendant as a matter of law.\u201d",
      "The PREP Act, enacted by Congress in 2005, authorizes the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to issue a declaration in the event of a public health emergency providing immunity from liability for activities related to medical countermeasures, such as the administration of a vaccine, except in cases of \u201cwillful misconduct\" that result in \u201cdeath or serious physical injury.\u201d A declaration against COVID-19 was issued on March 17, 2020. It is set to expire on Dec. 31. Federals suits claiming willful misconduct are filed in Washington.",
      "Social media users described the Vermont Supreme Court's ruling as having consequences beyond what it actually says.",
      "\u201cThe Vermont Supreme Court has ruled that schools can force-vaccinate children for Covid against the wishes of their parents,\u201d reads one X post that had been liked and shared approximately 16,600 times as of Tuesday. \u201cThe high court ruled on a case involving a 6-year-old boy who was forced to take a Covid mRNA injection by his school. However, his family had explicitly stated that they didn't want their child to receive the \u2018vaccines.\u2019\u201d",
      "Other users alleged that the ruling gives schools permission to give students any vaccine without parental consent, not just ones for COVID-19.",
      "Rod Smolla, president of the Vermont Law and Graduate School and an expert on constitutional law, told The Associated Press that the ruling \u201cmerely holds that the federal statute at issue, the PREP Act, preempts state lawsuits in cases in which officials mistakenly administer a vaccination without consent.\u201d",
      "\u201cNothing in the Vermont Supreme Court opinion states that school officials can vaccinate a child against the instructions of the parent,\u201d he wrote in an email.",
      "Asked whether the claims spreading online have any merit, Ronald Ferrara, an attorney representing the Politellas, told the AP that although the ruling doesn't say schools can vaccinate students regardless of parental consent, officials could interpret it to mean that they could get away with doing so under the PREP Act, at least when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. He explained that the U.S. Supreme Court appeal seeks to clarify whether the Vermont Supreme Court interpreted the PREP Act beyond what Congress intended.",

      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- Thirteen women from the Philippines have been convicted on human trafficking-related charges for acting as surrogates in Cambodia for a ring selling babies to foreigners for cash.",
      "The women were each sentenced to four years in prison after being found guilty of selling, buying or exchanging a person for cross-border transfer, the Kandal Provincial Court said late Monday.",
      "According to the verdict, two of the four years in prison were suspended, meaning they won't have to be served unless they're found guilty of another crime.",
      "The women are held at a police hospital outside Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, and authorities have previously said they would not have to serve prison time until after giving birth.",
      "The women can appeal the verdict, said court spokesperson So Sarin. He refused to comment on how many were still pregnant, or what would happen to the babies after they have given birth.",
      "Developing countries have been popular for surrogacy because costs are much lower compared to the United States and Australia, where surrogate services could cost around $150,000.",
      "The Cambodia case was unusual because surrogates normally are employed in their own countries, not transported elsewhere.",
      "Authorities have said the business that recruited the women was based in Thailand, and that their food and accommodation in Cambodia was organized there.",
      "The women were arrested in late September in a raid on a villa in Kandal province, where authorities found 20 Filipinos and four Vietnamese.",
      "At the time the women were charged in October, Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry said the ringleaders had not been identified. It said, however, that it considered the women offenders who conspired with the organizers to act as surrogates and then sell the babies for money, rather than victims.",
      "Eleven of the women who were not pregnant were deported, and the 13 Filipinos were charged under a provision on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation. The law was updated in 2016 to ban commercial surrogacy after Cambodia became a popular destination for foreigners seeking women to give birth to their children.",
      "Cambodia has a bad reputation for human trafficking, especially in connection with online scams in which foreigners recruited for work under false pretenses are kept in conditions of virtual slavery and help perpetrate criminal fraud online against targets in many countries.",
      "The surrogacy business boomed in Cambodia after it was put under tight restrictions in neighboring Thailand, as well as in India and Nepal.",
      "In July 2017, a Cambodian court sentenced an Australian woman and two Cambodian associates to 1 1/2 years in prison for providing commercial surrogacy services."

      "BOISE, Idaho -- A federal appeals court on Monday ruled that most of Idaho's first-in-the-nation law that makes it illegal to help minors get an abortion without the consent of their parents can take effect while a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality continues.",
      "The decision by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the statute\u2019s prohibition on helping a minor get an abortion by harboring and transporting them with the intent to conceal the procedure from the minor\u2019s parents is likely to be found constitutional and can be enforced.",
      "Part of the law remains blocked, however. The court found that the law\u2019s prohibition on \u201crecruiting\u201d pregnant youth violates the First Amendment. That means prosecutors, for now, will not be able to charge a person with \u201crecruiting\u201d or influencing a minor to have an abortion.",
      "\"Encouragement, counseling, and emotional support are plainly protected speech,\u201d the court wrote, even when that speech happens in the \u201ccontext of deciding whether to have an abortion.\u201d",
      "The ruling largely reverses U.S. Magistrate Judge Debora K. Grasham's decision, which prevented the law from being enforced after opponents sued the state in the summer of 2023.",
      "Abortion is banned in Idaho at all stages of pregnancy, and the law enacted in 2023 was designed to prevent minors from getting abortions in states where the procedure is legal if they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 permission.",
      "Supporters of the law call it an \u201cabortion trafficking\u201d ban. Opponents say it is an unconstitutional prohibition on interstate travel and free speech rights. Both sides framed Monday's ruling as a victory.",
      "\u201cThis decision is a significant victory for the plaintiffs, as it frees Idahoans to talk with pregnant minors about abortion health care,\u201d Wendy Heipt, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an emailed statement Monday.",
      "She said the plaintiffs, which include multiple advocacy groups, are also considering their appeal options.",
      "Idaho Attorney General Ra\u00fal Labrador in an emailed statement called the ruling a victory for the state.",
      "\u201cIdaho\u2019s laws were passed specifically to protect the life of the unborn and the life of the mother, Labrador said. \"Trafficking a minor child for an abortion without parental consent puts both in grave danger, and we will not stop protecting life in Idaho.\u201d",
      "The law makes it illegal to either obtain abortion pills for a minor or to help them leave the state for an abortion without their parents\u2019 knowledge and consent. Anyone convicted will face two to five years in prison and could also be sued by the minor\u2019s parent or guardian. A parent who raped their child will not be able to sue, though the criminal penalties for anyone who helped the minor obtain an abortion will remain in effect."

    "story": [
      "A Zimbabwean High Court judge has ruled that provisions of a law that deny abortion services to women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 are unconstitutional",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A law prohibiting abortion services for women raped by their husbands and girls under the age of 18 is unconstitutional, Zimbabwe\u2019s High Court has ruled.",
      "In his ruling handed down on Nov. 22 and made public this week, Judge Maxwell Takuva said since Zimbabwe\u2019s laws already criminalize marital rape and sex with a minor, victims should be allowed to abort if they become pregnant.",
      "The ruling is significant, given Zimbabwe\u2019s restrictive abortion laws that often lead women and girls into illegal and unsafe backstreet abortions that in many cases turn fatal.",
      "Abortion is allowed in very few circumstances in Zimbabwe, including such as if the pregnancy endangers the life of a woman, or if there is a risk of a physical or mental defect \u201cof such a nature that (the child) will permanently be seriously handicapped.\u201d Women can also access legal abortion services in cases of unlawful sex such as incest.",
      "Zimbabwe criminalized sex with any person below 18 in September following an earlier constitutional court ruling ordering parliament to raise the legal age of consent for sex to 18 from 16. But the highly restrictive Termination of Pregnancy Act still denied abortion services for girls under 18.",
      "\u201cThere is no doubt that it is torture, cruel and degrading treatment for a child to carry another child, for a child to give birth to another child or for a child to be forced to illegally abort because of cruel circumstances,\u201d said the judge.",
      "The government did not mount any opposition to the case, which was brought by a women\u2019s rights group, although the ruling must still be approved by the Constitutional Court to become effective.",
      "The judge said providing access to safe and legal abortion services for underage girls \u201cis significant in light of the massive instances of teenage pregnancies in Zimbabwe, and consequently illegal teen abortions and teenage mortalities.\u201d",
      "The country of 15 million people records about 77,000 unsafe abortions annually, but many others go unreported. Many girls and women die from abortion complications each year, according to the United Nations children\u2019s agency, UNICEF.",
      "Teen pregnancies are rife in the southern African country because of lax enforcement of laws, cultural and religious practices and widespread poverty that also make it difficult for girls and women to access contraceptives and clinics.",
      "Almost one of every four girls falls pregnant between the ages of 10 and 19, according to figures by the government and UNICEF. One of every three girls is wed before age 18 in the deeply conservative southern African country where girls are usually culturally forced to marry men responsible for their unplanned pregnancies."

      "Artificial intelligence is changing the way industries do business",
      "WASHINGTON -- Artificial intelligence is changing the way companies do business \u2014 helping programmers write code and fielding customer service calls with chatbots.",
      "But the pharmaceutical industry is still waiting to see whether AI can tackle its biggest challenge: finding faster, cheaper ways to develop new drugs.",
      "Despite billions poured into research, new medicines still typically take a decade or more to develop.",
      "Founded in 2018, Insitro is part of a growing field of AI companies promising to accelerate drug discovery by using machine learning to analyze huge datasets of chemical and biological markers. The South San Francisco-based company has signed deals with drugmakers like Eli Lilly and Bristol Myers Squibb to help develop medicines for metabolic diseases, neurological conditions and degenerative disorders.",
      "CEO and founder Daphne Koller spoke with the AP about what AI brings to the challenges of drug discovery. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "A: I think the problem with drug discovery is that we are trying to intervene in a system that we only slightly understand. Many of the successes that we\u2019ve seen in the last 15 to 20 years have been when we arrive at a sufficient understanding of the system so we can really design interventions to align with it.",
      "So one of the things that we try to do at Insitro is unravel the underlying complexity of heterogeneous diseases and identify new intervention modes that could help, maybe not the entire population, but perhaps just a subset of it. That way we can really identify the right therapeutic hypothesis to intervene in a particular patient population. And that, I think, is the real crux of the industry\u2019s lack of success.",
      "A: One of the things that has been happening in parallel to the AI revolution is a much quieter revolution in what I call quantitative biology, which is the ability to measure biological systems with unprecedented fidelity. You can measure systems like proteins and cells with increasingly better measurements and technology.",
      "But if you give that data to a person, their eyes will just glaze over because there\u2019s only so many cells someone can look at and only so many subtleties they can see in these images. People are just limited in their ability to perceive subtle differences.",
      "So you end up with a very reductionist view of a very complex, multifaceted system which is really important to unraveling the distinctions between patients and uncovering where an intervention really can make a difference.",
      "A: My PhD was in computer science. But I started to get into the field of machine learning in the service of biomedical problems back in 1998 or 1999.",
      "At that time, the problems that machine learning was able to tackle were, frankly, uninspiring. How inspired can you get about classifying spam versus non-spam in a dataset of email messages?",
      "I was looking for something that had more richness to it. And my first foray into this field was not because I was particularly interested in becoming a biologist, but because I was looking for more technically challenging questions. And then, as I started looking into it, I became interested in biology in its own right.",
      "A: This is probably one of the most important things we\u2019ve achieved as an organization.",
      "You can take the most sophisticated, best meaning scientists from either side and put them in the same room together and they might as well be speaking Thai and Swahili to each other.",
      "When you\u2019re an engineer, you\u2019re looking for the strongest, most consistent patterns that are going to allow you to make predictions about a majority of cells or individuals. When you\u2019re a life scientist, oftentimes you\u2019re actually looking for the exceptions because those are the threads that can lead to new discoveries.",

      "When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo",
      "NEW YORK -- When SmileDirectClub shut down a year ago, scores of existing customers of the teeth-straightening company were left in limbo. Now, tens of thousands are set to get some relief.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James has announced that her office recovered $4.8 million to distribute nationwide to more than 28,000 consumers. SmileDirectClub illegally charged those customers after it ceased operations, James said.",
      "\u201cDental care is expensive and SmileDirectClub promised customers that they would provide affordable, quality care without the price tag, but instead, they extracted thousands of dollars from hardworking people,\" James said in a prepared statement Monday. \u201cToday, we are putting money back into people\u2019s pockets who were cheated.\"",
      "SmileDirectClub, once a publicly traded company known for selling clear dental aligners, shut its doors in December 2023 \u2014 just months after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In an abrupt move, the company canceled outstanding orders and announced that its \u201cLifetime Smile Guarantee\u201d would no longer exist. At the time, SmileDirectClub also said that \u201cSmilePay\u201d customers were expected to continue payments, causing confusion and frustration.",
      "According to James' announcement, the majority of customers paid for their aligner treatments through the \u201cSmilePay\u201d program, which generally totaled more than $2,500 between an up-front payment and following installments.",
      "After the company folded in December 2023, James' office said it received complaints from New York consumers who were told to keep paying monthly installments, despite no longer receiving treatment in return \u2014 and that it soon sent SmileDirectClub a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "In response, SmileDirectClub directed her office to HPS Investment Partners, the agent of the company's secured lenders, and SmilePay service provider Healthcare Finance Direct. The company also revised its online FAQ to remove the note about continuing payments, and instead direct customers' further questions to HFD.",
      "Monday's settlement agreement means that impacted consumers should soon see some relief, either in the form of \u201ca partial or full refund of their installment payments or a reduction of their future payment obligations,\u201d according to HFD\u2019s website.",
      "If you're eligible, the amount of money you\u2019ll get will depend on several factors. Those include the date when you first received aligners from SmileDirectClub, if your services had begun yet, as well as how much of your treatment plan was completed at the time the company ceased operations, and the outstanding balances on your account.",
      "And not all refunds will come in the form of a settlement check. Compensation will first be applied to the outstanding balance on your account \u2014 meaning that future payments, while reduced, may still remain for those who were farther along in their treatment. But consumers eligible for a refund that exceeds their outstanding account balance will see that excess amount sent back to a bank account, debit card or credit card on file. If that's unsuccessful, HFD notes, a check will be mailed out.",
      "How many people end up registering for the settlement is also a factor. Total compensation plan is capped at $4.8 million, so it\u2019s possible refunds could be slightly below or above initial estimates once all requests are in.",
      "A portion of these refunds will be automatic, but other customers will only be available to submit a request to HFD directly. The deadline to submit that request is March 31, 2025. While eligible consumers will likely be contacted by HFD via email, more information can be found of the service provider's official website.",
      "Before shutting its doors, SmileDirectClub served over 2 million people since its 2014 founding. The company once promised to revolutionize the oral-care industry by selling clear dental aligners, via mail and in major retailers, that were marketed as a faster and more affordable alternative to braces.",
      "Still, the company later proved to be unprofitable year after year. By the time SmileDirectClub filed for bankruptcy in September 2023, it reported nearly $900 million in debt.",
      "And beyond financial woes, dental associations around the world have also continued to urge caution or express opposition to direct-to-consumer aligners \u2014 what some call \u201cDIY\u201d dentistry \u2014 citing risks around services that don't require in-person visits to a dentist or orthodontist. That resulted in ample criticism around SmileDirectClub, particularly after customers saw treatments discontinued last year, although other companies still provide similar direct-to-consumer aligners today."

But the truth is that it\u2019s more than just medical. It\u2019s love and acceptance.\u201d",
      "A subset of young people may be offered additional interventions such as puberty blockers to ease distress and give them time to explore their gender identity.",
      "The drugs, known as GnRH agonists, block the release of key hormones involved in sexual maturation. They\u2019ve been used for decades to treat precocious puberty, an uncommon medical condition that causes puberty to begin abnormally early.",
      "The medication starts after a young person show early signs of puberty \u2014 enlargement of breasts or testicles. This typically occurs around age 8 to 13 for those assigned female at birth and a year or two later for those assigned male at birth.",
      "The drugs can be given as injections every few months or as arm implants lasting up to a year or two. Many of the effects are reversible \u2014 puberty and sexual development resume as soon as the drugs are stopped. Researchers are exploring the effects of puberty blockers on bone development, but no research has shown an increased risk for bone fractures.",

      "After puberty blockers, trans adolescents go through puberty either with or without hormone treatment.",
      "Some may choose to take hormones to make their bodies more closely match their gender identity. They take manufactured versions of either estrogen or testosterone \u2014 hormones that prompt sexual development in puberty. Estrogen comes in skin patches and pills. Testosterone is available in injections, implants or gels.",
      "Guidelines recommend starting these when teens are mature enough to make informed medical decisions. Many transgender people take the hormones for life.",
      "If the medication is stopped, some physical changes remain. Testosterone generally leads to permanent voice-lowering, facial hair and development of the Adam\u2019s apple. Estrogen can lead to permanent breast development.",
      "Research on long-term hormone use in transgender adults has found potential health risks including a modest risk for blood clots with estrogen and negative cholesterol changes with testosterone.",
      "Gender-affirming surgery in transgender teens is far less common than hormone treatment. When it is done among transgender youth, it\u2019s almost always breast reduction surgery in older transgender males.",
      "Even so, that type of surgery is extremely rare. Perhaps surprisingly, breast reduction among minors is most frequently performed in males who are not transgender. This is for a condition called gynecomastia, which means having more breast tissue than usual.",
      "A study looking at millions of 2019 insurance claims found 151 breast reductions performed for U.S. minors. Nearly all \u2014 97% \u2014 were not transgender.",

      "In one study, researchers spent two years testing and tracking 315 transgender youth who received hormone therapy. Depression and anxiety symptoms eased and life satisfaction increased among those designated female at birth, but not among those designated male at birth.

      "\u201cMcDonald\u2019s is no longer serving recalled onions and there does not appear to be a continued food safety concern related to this outbreak,\u201d the FDA said Tuesday in a statement.",
      "McDonald's briefly pulled Quarter Pounders from 3,000 U.S. stores as a result of the outbreak, then narrowed that to 900 stores once testing had pinpointed onions \u2014 and not hamburger patties \u2014 as the likely source of E. coli. The company found an alternate supplier and resumed selling Quarter Pounders with slivered onions at all U.S. stores last month.",
      "But the outbreak has hurt demand. In mid-November, McDonald's said it planned to spend $100 million to bring customers back to stores, including $65 million that will go directly to the hardest-hit franchisees.",
      "Chicago-based McDonald's wouldn't say Tuesday whether its sales have returned to normal levels in the affected regions. But it thanked U.S. regulators for their quick action and said it remains confident in its rigorous food-safety standards.",
      "McDonald's last major food-safety issue happened in 2018, when more than 500 people contracted an intestinal illness after eating its salads.",
      "McDonald's also declined to comment Tuesday on legal action against the company as a result of the E. coli outbreak.",
      "Nicole and Richard West of Townsend, Montana, are suing McDonald\u2019s after their 11-month-old daughter, Logan, was hospitalized in October with E. coli poisoning. The toddler ate a few bites of her father\u2019s Quarter Pounder hamburger with onions during a family road trip on Oct. 2.",
      "She fell ill a few days later with severe vomiting and diarrhea. Her mother rushed her to the hospital, where she was found to be infected with E. coli O157:H7, which can cause life-threatening illness, particularly in young children.",
      "Richard West also fell ill but didn\u2019t seek medical attention because he was at home caring for the family\u2019s other children. He lost more than two weeks of work as a truck driver because of the outbreak and the family faces a barrage of medical expenses.",
      "Nicole West said Tuesday that Logan's health has improved but the outbreak has shaken the family\u2019s confidence in the fast-food giant.",
      "\u201cWith kids, when you want to go out to eat, they want to go to McDonald\u2019s. They want to get a Happy Meal,\u201d West said. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t trust it anymore.\u201d"

    "summary": "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
    "story": [
      "Reproductive rights advocates are trying to dismantle a 15-week abortion ban in Arizona that conflicts with newly expanded access establishing a fundamental right to abortion in the state",
      "PHOENIX -- Reproductive rights advocates sued Arizona on Tuesday to undo a 15-week abortion ban that conflicts with a constitutional amendment recently approved by voters to expand access up to fetal viability.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed the lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court on behalf of the local chapter of Planned Parenthood and two physicians, arguing the law interferes with pregnant Arizonans\u2019 fundamental right to abortion and individual autonomy. It\u2019s the first step in efforts to dismantle existing laws they say are too restrictive.",
      "The Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature approved the 15-week ban months before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, but it didn't go into effect until after. Democratic Attorney General Kris Mayes agreed not to enforce the 15-week ban while the lawsuit plays out, spokesperson Richie Taylor said Tuesday.",
      "Democratic Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs said in a statement Tuesday that the ban should be removed from the books.",
      "\u201cArizonans made it clear that they support reproductive freedom, and there is no question that a ban with no exceptions for rape or incest should be removed from our laws,\" she said, adding that she is \"glad Arizonans are working to finish the job and enforce the constitutional protections we now enjoy.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit also seeks to undo the ban\u2019s enforcement mechanisms, which could lead to criminal charges against providers who knowingly or intentionally perform abortions beyond 15 weeks except in medical emergencies. Physicians who violate the ban could face suspension or revocation of their medical licenses.",
      "\u201cThe amendment itself does not sort of wipe the statute books clean, you know. Further action is needed in order to take that additional step to effectuate the amendment\u2019s promise,\u201d ACLU staff attorney Rebecca Chan said. \u201cAnd so that\u2019s really what this 15-week ban challenge is.\u201d",
      "Arizona was one of five states where voters approved ballot measures in the 2024 general election to add the right to an abortion to their state constitutions. Nevada voters also approved an amendment to codify its existing abortion rights in the state constitution, but they\u2019ll need to pass it again in 2026 for it to take effect. Another that bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d prevailed in New York.",
      "The Arizona ballot measure gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a near-total abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "The measure expands access to fetal viability \u2014 the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus. Though there\u2019s no defined time frame for viability, doctors say it\u2019s sometime after 21 weeks. It allows abortions after viability if they are necessary to protect the physical or mental health of the mother, or to save her life.",
      "Most abortions happen early in pregnancy. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 93% of them nationally in 2022 were in the first 13 weeks, though that data does not include California and some other states where advocates believe a higher proportion of abortions are performed later in pregnancy.",
      "The Nov. 25 certification of the general election opened the door for legal challenges to laws that conflict with the ballot measure, including a law that requires patients to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before an abortion, with the option to view the image and hear an explanation of what it shows.",
      "Reproductive rights groups signaled then that they would sue over the 15-week abortion ban.",
      "\u201cClearly Planned Parenthood and ACLU and their allies have little regard for the life of an unborn child and the development of an unborn child,\" said Cathi Herrod, president of the socially conservative Center for Arizona Policy. Herrod previosly said the group would seek to intervene where appropriate.",
      "Most Republican-controlled states have banned or restricted access to abortion, and abortion rights groups have pushed back.",
      "In Missouri, Planned Parenthood affiliates sued immediately after a ballot measure there passed seeking to have bans and other abortion-restricting laws invalidated. The circumstances are different there because that state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and no clinics are providing it. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday.",
      "Missouri\u2019s Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey wrote in an opinion that he will enforce some laws restricting abortion despite voter approval of a constitutional amendment widely expected to undo the state\u2019s near-total ban on the procedure."

      "The issue of transgender rights animated the presidential campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep.",
      "Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee\u2019s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future.",
      "Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trump put his fierce opposition front and center.",
      "Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience.",
      "\u201cI am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.\u201d",
      "Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother.",
      "He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth.",
      "Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely.",
      "\u201cTennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,\u201d state attorneys wrote in court filings.",
      "Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley.",
      "The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government\u2019s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young.",
      "\u201cMany of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,\u201d he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it\u2019s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide.",
      "\u201cThere is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,\u201d he said.",
      "The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.",

      "But for a football-loving nation hungry for its first World Cup qualification and an Africa Cup of Nations triumph, the two-week tournament in Nzerekore, almost 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) from the capital of Conakry, had attracted not just adults and youths, but also children.",
      "Chaos had erupted at the crowded and open stadium after fans protested a referee\u2019s penalty call and were throwing stones towards the field, according to witnesses and local media. Security forces reacted to the disturbance with tear gas as fans poured onto the pitch, survivors said.",

      "BEIRUT -- The leader of Syria's most powerful insurgent group toured the seized city of Aleppo on Wednesday in a surprise visit \u2014 the first since the group captured large parts of the city over the weekend as fierce fighting intensifies in the government-led counter-offensive in northern Hama.",
      "Abu Mohammed al-Golani, who heads the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, greeted crowds of supporters near the city's iconic citadel as he smiled and waved in dark green military garb. Surrounded by masked gunmen in flak jackets, men and boys chanted \u201cGod is great\u201d as he walked through the heart of Syria's largest city.",
      "The sudden capture of Aleppo, also an ancient business hub, was a stunning prize for Syrian opponents of President Bashar Assad.",
      "It was the first opposition attack on the city since 2016, when a brutal Russian air campaign retook the northwestern city for Assad after rebel forces had initially seized it. Intervention by Russia, Iran and Iranian-allied militant Hezbollah and other groups has allowed Assad to remain in power.",
      "The latest flareup in Syria\u2019s long civil war comes after forces opposed to Assad ousted his troops from Aleppo and seized towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province, likely exploiting the fact that Assad's main regional and international backers were preoccupied with their own wars.",
      "The offensive is being led by the jihadi HTS as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates.",
      "The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years.",
      "Elsewhere, Syrian authorities said their counteroffensive pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgents said they captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles.",
      "Syrian state SANA news agency on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into Hama as they did over the weekend into Aleppo.",
      "A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria\u2019s civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He has worked for dpa since 2017.",
      "Ali Suleiman, a freelance journalist who was with Alkharboutli when the strike happened but was unharmed, said that a low-flying plane circled overhead before striking at a group of journalists \u2014 which Suleiman said indicated the targeting was deliberate. Alkharboutli was seriously wounded and succumbed to his wounds a short while later as he was being taken in an ambulance back to Idlib.",
      "The insurgents claimed on their Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app that they captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed.",
      "If the insurgents seize the city of Hama and take control of the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite minority and a strategic Russian naval base.",
      "Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cIf we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,\" Pedersen said in an address to the U.N. Security Council. \"Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration, and destruction.\"",
      "About 3,000 displaced people from the Hama countryside and Aleppo made their way to the city of Homs, with many more on the way. Those who arrived and found shelter in schools told The Associated Press that they spent hours in traffic, many struggling to afford surging gas prices.",
      "Nidal Assaf, 38, fled the northern Hama countryside where the insurgents seized several towns and villages. Speaking from a school-turned-shelter in Homs, he said the local residents and the army couldn't handle the attackers, and that he had to flee amid the fighting with his family and tens of relatives.",
      "\u201cPeople eventually had to flee,\u201d he said.",
      "Youssef Choueib said he fled Aleppo to Homs for the third time since 2011. First, he left when rebels last took the city, then after a massive earthquake in 2023 rattled northern Syria and Turkey, and finally now.",

Assad has insisted that Turkey\u2019s withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries.",
      "Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist.",
      "Turkish and Iranian officials met earlier this week, in a bid to reach a solution to de-escalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria, which once backed groups that tried to overthrow Assad, have expressed concern of the conflict's regional impacts, and have backed the president.",

      "IZVORANI, Romania -- The surprise front-runner in Romania\u2019s presidential election insisted to The Associated Press in an interview Wednesday that he is not pro-Russian \u2014 hours before Romania declassified intelligence alleging Moscow ran an online campaign to promote him to voters.",
      "Far-right populist Calin Georgescu could not immediately be reached about the unprecedented intelligence release ordered by President Klaus Iohannis, which alleges a sprawling network of thousands of social media accounts across platforms like TikTok and Telegram that promoted Georgescu content. The intelligence indicated a modus operandi and resources \u201cspecific to a state actor.\u201d",
      "\u201cRomania is a target for aggressive Russian hybrid actions, including cyber attacks and information leaks \u2026 and sabotage,\u201d a document from the Foreign Intelligence Service says. It was not immediately clear from the intelligence release whether Georgescu was aware of the alleged campaign or assisted in it.",
      "Sitting at his desk in an isolated compound north of Bucharest earlier Wednesday, Georgescu told the AP that \u201cI am interested in us being a sovereign and self-sufficient power. Freedom and independence come from the ability to finance yourself, not from being financed by others.\u201d",
      "He said Romania\u2019s Western alliances remain secure providing they \u201cserve the sovereignty of the country and nothing else.\u201d",
      "But his success has left Western allies on edge. In the past, Georgescu \u2014 who declared zero campaign spending \u2014 praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as \u201ca man who loves his country\u201d and called Ukraine \u201can invented state.\u201d Still, he claims not to be pro-Russian.",
      "Georgescu unexpectedly topped the polls in the first round of the Romanian presidential vote on Nov. 24 despite being a huge outsider, plunging the European Union and NATO country into unprecedented turmoil. On Sunday, he will face reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union party in a final vote.",
      "His vision lies in Romania-first policies in a push to become self-reliant in areas such as energy, food, and water. Other key issues he wants to address if he wins the presidency include tackling high poverty rates, organized crime and drug use in schools.",
      "Georgescu is also a self-professed Donald Trump supporter and said the incoming U.S. president \u201cknows what he wants, he loves his people, he put America first, just like I put Romania first ... we have the same ideology.\u201d",
      "Georgescu has courted controversy for describing Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders from the 1930s and 1940s as national heroes. He denies having any connection to extremist organizations and says the quotes were misrepresented.",
      "\u201cI am only for God and my country,\u201d he said. \u201cPeriod.\u201d",
      "Once a member of Romania\u2019s far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, Georgescu left the party in 2022 after being accused by colleagues of being Russia-friendly and critical of NATO.",
      "Romania has played a key role in the U.S.-led military alliance since Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine nearly three years ago. Observers wonder how a Georgescu presidency could affect NATO unity.",
      "\u201cNATO is a defensive organization, but as long as it remains defensive, everything is fine,\u201d the presidential hopeful said. \u201cWe will evaluate and see what is to Romania\u2019s advantage \u2026 Everything, no matter what, must benefit the Romanian people,\" referring to two NATO bases in Romania.",
      "On the war in Ukraine, \u201cit\u2019s a very difficult and grave situation,\" he said. \"And my main position is a strategy of peace. Peace with everyone, regardless of who they are.\u201d",
      "But Lasconi, his opponent in Sunday\u2019s runoff, has cast Georgescu as a threat to democracy and national security who is not fit for high office.",
      "\u201cLet us be very clear, Calin Georgescu is an open admirer of Vladimir Putin. He is openly against NATO and the European Union,\u201d she said a day after the first vote. She added that \"without NATO we are at the mercy of Russia.\u201d",
      "Georgescu's past controversial remarks are wide-ranging and include questioning vaccine safety, calling climate change a \u201cbusiness scam\" and saying \u201cfeminism is an absolute mess.\u201d",
      "Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania\u2019s environment ministry in the 1990s \u2014 as well as black belts in judo and karate. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the United Nations Environment Program.",
      "But he remained a little-known entity until just weeks ago.",
      "Many observers attributed his success to his TikTok account, which now has 5.8 million likes and 531,000 followers. But some experts suspect Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while Romania\u2019s top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates.",
      "In Romania's intelligence release hours after Georgescu's AP interview, the secret services alleged that one TikTok user paid more $381,000 (361,000 euros) to other users to promote Georgescu content. Intelligence authorities said information it obtained \u201crevealed an aggressive promotion campaign\u201d to increase and accelerate his popularity.",
      "Asked by the AP whether he believes the Chinese-owned TikTok can pose a threat to democracy, Georgescu said: \u201cThe most important existing function for promoting free speech and freedom of expression is social media.\u201d",
      "He added that Romania\u2019s political class has \u201cconstantly shown an inferiority complex\u201d toward the West and vowed to change the dynamic.",
      "\u201cEverything I do and will do will be from a negotiation standpoint, in the sense that Romania will stand tall and not on its knees,\u201d he said."

      "Records from the U.S. Bureau of Prisons show that Fabio Ochoa V\u00e1squez was released Tuesday after completing 25 years of a 30-year prison sentence.",
      "Ochoa, 67, and his older brothers amassed a fortune when cocaine started flooding the U.S. in the late 1970s and early 1980s, according to U.S. authorities, to the point that in 1987 they were included in the Forbes Magazine's list of billionaires. Living in Miami, Ochoa ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel once headed by Pablo Escobar.",

      "Ochoa was first indicted in the U.S. for his alleged role in the 1986 killing of Drug Enforcement Administration informant Barry Seal \u2014 whose life was popularized in in the 2017 film \u201cAmerican Made\u201d starring Tom Cruise.",
      "He was initially arrested in 1990 in Colombia under a government program promising drug kingpins would not be extradited to the U.S. At the time, he was on the U.S. list of the \u201cDozen Most Wanted\u201d Colombia drug lords.",
      "Ochoa was arrested again and extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 people as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy. Of those, Ochoa was the only one who opted to go to trial, resulting in his conviction and the 30-year sentence. The other defendants got much lighter prison terms because most of them cooperated with the government.",
      "Richard Gregorie, a retired Assistant U.S. Attorney who was on the prosecution team that convicted Ochoa, said authorities were never able to seize all of the the Ochoa family's illicit drug proceeds and he expects that Ochoa will have a welcome return home.",
      "\u201cHe won't be retiring a poor man, that's for sure,\u201d Gregorie told The Associated Press.",
      "Richard Klugh, a Miami-based attorney for Ochoa, declined to comment.",

      "PARIS -- France\u2019s far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday in a historic no-confidence vote prompted by budget disputes that forces Prime Minister Michel Barnier and his Cabinet members to resign, a first since 1962.",
      "The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed.",

      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte is leading a fresh push for European countries to ramp up defense spending",
      "BRUSSELS -- NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte led a fresh push Wednesday for European countries to ramp up defense spending, a budget shortfall that President-elect Donald Trump used to berate U.S. allies during his first term in office, severely damaging trust.",
      "After Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula a decade ago, NATO leaders agreed to halt the defense cuts that began when the Cold War ended and move toward spending 2% of GDP on their military budgets.",
      "Since Russia launched its full-fledged invasion almost three years ago, the leaders have agreed that the 2% target should be the floor rather than the ceiling for defense spending. On average, U.S. allies combined meet that figure, but around a third of the members still do not individually.",
      "Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, threatened not to defend \u201cdelinquent\u201d countries. NATO is founded on the principle that an attack on any member must be considered an attack on them all. Trump\u2019s remarks undermined confidence that the U.S. could be counted on in a crisis.",
      "\u201cIf you want to keep the deterrence at the present level, 2% is not enough,\u201d Rutte told reporters after chairing a meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. \u201cWe can now defend ourselves and nobody should try to attack us. But I want that to stay the same in 4 or 5 years.\u201d",
      "In July, U.S. President Joe Biden and his NATO counterparts endorsed the biggest shakeup of the way the military alliance would respond to any attack on its territory by Russia since the Cold War. It was meant to deter Moscow from targeting any of the 32 allies.",
      "Under highly secret new plans, NATO intends to have up to 300,000 troops ready to move to its eastern flank within 30 days. The plans lay out which allies would respond to an attack anywhere from the Arctic and Baltic Sea region through the Atlantic and east to the Black Sea.",
      "But senior NATO officials concede that countries might have to spend up to 3% of GDP to execute the security blueprint successfully. A new spending target is likely to be announced next year. Rutte also said NATO might set specific targets for member countries to fill military equipment gaps.",
      "U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy insisted that \u201cthe time to act is now.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in very dangerous times,\u201d he said, singling out Russia and its role in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa, on top of its war on Ukraine. \u201cWe urge all allies across the NATO family to get serious about defense spending.\u201d",
      "On his last visit to Brussels for a NATO meeting, the U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that \u201cthis is a time for every ally to lean in, not lean back.\u201d The United States is by far the organization's most powerful member country.",
      "\u201cA stronger NATO means more capabilities to deter aggression, more effective allies to meet more complex challenges, and the peace and stability that allows our people to pursue fuller lives,\u201d Blinken said.",
      "Rutte also underlined the importance of expanding Europe\u2019s defense industry, with incentives to drive companies to set up more production lines and hire more workers to staff them, as Western support for Ukraine drains armament stocks.",
      "\u201cWe are producing not enough at too high prices, and the delivery is too slow,\u201d he said. \u201cWe cannot have a situation where we just pay more for the same, and we see large kickbacks to the shareholders.\u201d",
      "Rutte urged the allies \u201cto work closely together to make sure that we produce at a much higher rate and acceptable prices.\u201d He noted \u201ca number of countries who are now buying South Korean (equipment) because our own defense companies are not producing at a rate we need.\u201d"

      "The ruling Georgian Dream retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia\u2019s EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia\u2019s help and boycotted parliament sessions.",

      "The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc\u2019s recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a \u201cforeign influence\u201d law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cpursuing the interest of a foreign power,\u201d similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.",
      "The Georgian government\u2019s announcement of the EU accession talks\u2019 suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October\u2019s election as neither free nor fair.",
      "On Monday, the EU reiterated its \u201cserious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.\u201d",

      "The search for the men stalled on Tuesday and Wednesday due to deteriorating weather conditions on Aoraki, also known as Mount Cook, with heavy rain and snow forecast. Walker earlier hoped efforts would resume Thursday but said conditions on the day were unsafe.",
      "Aoraki is 3,724 meters (12,218 feet) high and is part of the Southern Alps, the scenic and icy mountain range that runs the length of New Zealand\u2019s South Island. A settlement of the same name at its base is a destination for domestic and foreign tourists.",
      "The peak is popular among experienced climbers. Its terrain is technically difficult due to crevasses, avalanche risk, changeable weather and glacier movement.",
      "More than 240 deaths have been recorded on the mountain and in the surrounding national park since the start of the 20th century."

    "story": [
      "Over the past dozen years, Syrian militant leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has worked to remake his image and the insurgency he commands",
      "BEIRUT -- Over the past dozen years, Syrian militant leader Abu Mohammed al-Golani has worked to remake his public image and the insurgency he commands, renouncing longtime ties to al-Qaida and consolidating power before emerging from the shadows.",
      "Now al-Golani, 42, seeks to seize the moment yet again, leading his fighters in a stunning offensive that has put them in control of Syria\u2019s largest city, reigniting the country's long civil war and raising new questions about President Bashar Assad\u2019s hold on power.",
      "The surge and al-Golani's place at the head of it are evidence of a remarkable transformation. Al-Golani's success on the battlefield follows years of maneuvering among extremist organizations while eliminating competitors and former allies.",
      "Along the way he moved to distance himself from al-Qaida, polishing his image and his extremist group's de-facto \u201csalvation government\u201d in an attempt to win over international governments and the country\u2019s religious and ethnic minorities.",
      "Putting himself forward as a champion of pluralism and tolerance, al-Golani's rebranding efforts sought to broaden his group's public support and legitimacy.",
      "Still, it had been years since Syria\u2019s opposition forces, based in the country's northwest, made any substantial military progress against Assad. The Syrian president's government, with backing from Iran and Russia, has maintained its control of about 70 percent of the country in a stalemate that had left al-Golani and his jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, out of the spotlight.",
      "But the rebels' descent on Aleppo and nearby towns, alongside a coalition of Turkish-backed armed groups dubbed the Syrian National Army, has shaken up Syria\u2019s tense detente and left the war-torn country\u2019s neighbors in Jordan, Iraq, and Lebanon worried about this flareup spilling over.",
      "Al-Golani\u2019s ties to al-Qaida stretch back to 2003 when he joined extremists battling U.S. troops in Iraq. The native of Syria was detained several times by the U.S. military, but remained in Iraq. During that time, al-Qaida usurped likeminded groups and formed the extremist Islamic State of Iraq, led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.",
      "In 2011, a popular uprising against Syria's Assad triggered a brutal government crackdown and led to all-out war. Al-Golani's prominence grew when al-Baghdadi sent him to Syria to establish a branch of al-Qaida called the Nusra Front. The United States labeled the new group as a terrorist organization. That designation still remains in place and the U.S. government has put a $10 million bounty on him.",
      "As Syria's civil war intensified in 2013, so did al-Golani\u2019s ambitions. He defied al-Baghdadi\u2019s calls to dissolve the Nusra Front and merge it with al-Qaida's operation in Iraq, to form the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS.",
      "Al-Golani nonetheless pledged his allegiance to al-Qaida, which later disassociated itself from ISIS. The Nusra Front battled ISIS and eliminated much of its competition among the Syrian armed opposition to Assad. In his first interview in 2014, al-Golani kept his face covered, telling a reporter for Qatari network Al-Jazeera that he rejected political talks in Geneva to end the conflict. He said his goal was to see Syria ruled under Islamic law and made clear that there was no room for the country's Alawite, Shiite, Druze, and Christian minorities.",
      "In 2016, al-Golani revealed his face to the public for the first time in a video message that announced his group was renaming itself Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and cutting its ties to al-Qaida.",
      "\u201cThis new organization has no affiliation to any external entity,\u201d he said in the video, filmed wearing military garb and a turban.",
      "The move paved the way for al-Golani to assert full control over fracturing militant groups. A year later, his alliance rebranded again as HTS as the groups merged, consolidating al-Golani\u2019s power in northwest Syria\u2019s Idlib province.",
      "Afterward HTS clashed with independent Islamist militants who opposed the merger, further emboldening al-Golani and and his group as the leading power in northwestern Syria, able to rule with an iron fist.",
      "With his power consolidated, al-Golani set in motion a transformation that few could have imagined. Replacing his military garb with shirt and trousers, he began calling for religious tolerance and pluralism. He appealed to the Druze community in Idlib, which the Nusra Front had previously targeted, and visited the families of Kurds who were killed by Turkish-backed militias.",
      "In 2021, al-Golani had his first interview with an American journalist on PBS. Wearing a blazer, with his short hair gelled back, the now more soft-spoken HTS leader said that his group posed no threat to the West and that sanctions imposed against it were unjust.",
      "\u201cYes, we have criticized Western policies,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to wage a war against the United States or Europe from Syria, that\u2019s not true. We didn\u2019t say we wanted to fight.\u201d"

      "The talks are taking place between South Sudan's government and opposition groups that were not part of the 2018 agreement that ended a five-year civil war in which more than 400,000 people died. Dubbed Tumaini, which is Swahili for hope, the talks began in May and the sides signed a \u201ccommitment declaration\u201d for peace.",
      "They subsequently stalled, after South Sudanese President Salva Kiir sacked the previous government delegation to the talks. A new team was then appointed to represent the government side but it was unable to travel to Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, on two subsequent occasions.",
      "No reasons were given for the sackings and travel delays. Last month, Kiir said the talks in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, were not meant to replace the 2018 peace deal but to address and integrate the concerns of holdout groups.",
      "While the 2018 peace agreement is yet to be fully implemented, South Sudan has postponed elections, scheduled for December 2024 to 2026. The elections are to be the first in South Sudan since its independence in 2011.",
      "The postponement was over pending registration of voters, a process that faced financial shortages amid an economic crisis that has seen civil servants go for more than a year without salaries.",
      "Oil export constitute the main source of revenue and a damaged pipeline in neighboring Sudan, where a civil war is underway, has tampered with oil exports from South Sudan.",
      "In the talks so far, the two sides have also protested against a new law that allow for detentions without arrest warrants, saying they went against human rights.",

      "Kuol Manyang Juuk, from the government side, urged the parties to set aside their differences. \u201cWe are not here to start the talks from scratch; we are here to build on what has been accomplished,\u201d Kuol said."

    "story": [
      "Mexican soldiers and marines have seized over a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids in the north in what officials are calling the biggest catch of the synthetic opioid in the country's history",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican soldiers and marines have seized over a ton of fentanyl pills in two raids in the north, with officials calling it the biggest catch of the synthetic opioid in the country\u2019s history.",
      "The raids came after a sharp drop in fentanyl seizures in Mexico earlier this year, and days after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico unless those countries cracked down on the flow of migrants and drugs across the border.",
      "Experts say the timing may not be a coincidence.",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the Mexican government has been managing the timing of fentanyl seizures,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo. \u201cBut under the pressure by Donald Trump, it appears President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration is willing to the increase the capture of drug traffickers and drug seizures that Washington is demanding.\u201d",
      "Saucedo said it's clear the Mexican government \"doesn't see fentanyl as one of its own problems, and fighting it isn't its priority,\u201d He added there would only be big busts \u201cwhen there is pressure from Washington.\u201d",
      "Mexico\u2019s top security official said soldiers and marines late Tuesday spotted two men carrying guns in the northern state of Sinaloa, home to the drug cartel of the same name.",
      "They chased the men, who ran into two houses. In one house soldiers found about 660 pounds (300 kilograms) of fentanyl, and in the other a truck packed with about 1,750 pounds (800 kilograms) of the drug, mostly in pill form.",
      "\u201cIn Sinaloa, we achieved the biggest seizure in history of fentanyl,\u201d Public Safety Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch wrote in his social media accounts. Several guns were also seized and two men were arrested.",
      "President Sheinbaum said Wednesday that \u201cthis is an investigation that had been going on for some time, and yesterday it bore fruit.\"",
      "But that claim contrasts with the seemingly random nature of the bust, which started when a military patrol \u201cnoticed the presence of two men carrying what appeared to be guns.\u201d",
      "In the past, Mexican security forces have sometimes used the story of following armed men running into houses as a pretext to enter homes without search warrants. In at least one case, the government version was disproved by security camera footage.",
      "The latest haul was striking because fentanyl seizures in Mexico had fallen dramatically in the first half of the year. At some points during the summer, under former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, federal forces reported seizures amounted to as little as 50 grams (2 ounces) per week.",
      "Figures for the first half of 2024 show that Mexican federal forces seized only 286 pounds (130 kilograms) of fentanyl nationwide between January and June, down 94% from the 5,135 pounds (2,329 kilograms) seized in 2023.",
      "The synthetic opioid has been blamed for about 70,000 overdose deaths annually in the United States, and U.S. officials have tried to step up efforts to seize it as it comes over the border, often in the form of counterfeit pills made in Mexico from precursor chemicals largely imported from China.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador always denied that fentanyl is even produced in Mexico, though experts \u2014 and even members of his own administration \u2014 acknowledge that it is.",
      "And if Mexico doesn't go after those fentanyl production facilities, then they will still be churning out similar quantities in the future.",
      "\u201cIt's a very very big seizure,\u201d Saucedo said. \u201cBut if they don't dismantle the labs, this kind of production will continue.\u201d",
      "Also Wednesday, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing the reward for the top leader of another cartel, Nemesio Oseguera, from $10 million to $15 million.",
      "Oseguera, known by his nickname \u201cEl Mencho,\u201d leads the Jalisco cartel, which like Sinaloa, is heavily involved in the manufacture and distribution of fentanyl and methamphetamines.",

      "A special spotlight is now shining on their little-noticed skills: UNESCO inscribed the zinc roof restoration techniques on its list of Intangible Cultural Heritage on Wednesday.",
      "\u2033The restoration of a roof involves removing the old pieces of zinc, measuring and custom-cutting new pieces using a Parisian folding machine, and assembling and fixing the pieces onto the roof,\u2033 UNESCO said in its citation. \u2033With nearly 80 percent of the roofs in Paris covered in zinc, the city is a living archive of these skills that shape the unique identity of its urban landscape.\u2033",
      "Most of the roofers are men, most are young. They often like heights, architecture, and working outdoors.",
      "Fantine Dekens, 21, is a climber who worked as a bartender but wanted a profession that took her outside and high up. She has been working as a roofer since 2021.",
      "\u2033There is a sort of romanticism around the roofs of Paris that attracted me,\u2033 she told the Associated Press.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s super to be outdoors. But there is a physical reality that you can\u2019t ignore. It\u2019s often very cold, or very hot, the things to carry are heavy,\u2033 she said. \u2033You can\u2019t do this trade eternally.\u2033",
      "Roofers are hoping the UNESCO recognition will inspire others to join their ranks and improve their working conditions.",
      "The profession is short of workers with the specialized skills for preserving the zinc roofs that have been a distinctive feature of Paris since the 19th century Haussmann era, from balconied apartment buildings along tree-lined avenues to historic churches that dot the French capital.",
      "\u2033It\u2019s a recognition for our trade, but for me, it\u2019s only useful if it is accompanied by a reflection on why there are so few roofers,\u2033 she said.",
      "Using welding techniques from the 1800s, they measure each new sheet of zinc so it fits the shape of the roof just right. Then they mount the often slippery roofs to affix the sheets to their new home.",
      "\u2033There\u2019s a very poetic side when you\u2019re up high,\u2033 she said. \u2033I feel very free in my movements. We take naps during our breaks. Often we sing, we shout. No one is watching us. And we can observe all of Paris at the same time. It\u2019s pretty incredible.\u2033",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014-",

      "For the artistic and cultural elites of the West African nation of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- For the artistic and cultural elites of Senegal, the monthlong Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Arts is a celebratory moment.",
      "Every two years, hundreds of artists, curators and art lovers from across the world descend on the West African capital to attend the event, which was founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government and has over the decades become one of the most important showcases on the continent.",
      "Pop-up exhibitions are held in hundreds of venues, from stylish five-star hotels to local art galleries. Roads are even more crowded than usual, with traffic jams stretching out for miles along the Corniche, the city\u2019s picturesque seaside boulevard. Every night, there are music concerts, fashion shows, talks with artists and movie screenings held against the backdrop of palm trees and to the soundtrack of popping champagne bottles.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t until this year that the local artisans in the Soumbedioune crafts market, just off the Corniche and at the doorstep on the Medina working-class neighborhood, realized what the Biennale was.",
      "For years, \u201cwe saw the OFF signs, but we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\" said Ndiouga Dia, a 48-year-old leatherworker from Soumbedioune, referring to a series of events organized in parallel to the official government program, scattered all over the city. \u201cOnly the artists knew among themselves what was going on.\u201d",
      "Craftsmanship is deeply rooted in the country\u2019s culture. Senegal, like most African nations, has little capacity for industrial production, and traditionally much of its economy has relied on locally produced goods. For centuries, craftsmen played a central role in Senegalese social life, sculpting religious statues and ceremonial masks, sewing boubous (traditional colorful wide-sleeved robes), molding pottery and weaving baskets.",
      "But these days, their role is in decline. As living costs rise, many Senegalese opt for cheaper, often Chinese products. And those that can afford it buy Western clothes and furniture to mark their social status.",
      "So when two designers approached Dia, who is also the community leader of the Soumbedioune artisans, with a proposal for a joint exhibition, he didn't hesitate for a second.",
      "It felt good to be noticed and included, Dia said.",
      "Designers Kemi Bass\u00e8ne and Khadim Ndiaye asked five artisans \u2014 a sculptor, a painter, a jeweler, a leatherworker and a upholsterer \u2014 to interpret the theme of \u201chippo.\u201d",
      "They chose the theme because it was easily recognizable across Africa, they said, bringing together people from different nations who live next to the water.",
      "The exhibition, held in the central square of Soumbedioune, surrounded by artisanal boutiques and restaurants selling thieboudienne, the most famous Senegalese dish, has been a hit among locals. There are hippo earrings and a hippo necklace; a giant wooden sculpture of a sleeping hippo; and a hippo-shaped bag.",
      "Papise Kant\u00e9, a 45-year-old sculptor who created two wooden hippo statues for the exhibition, said it allowed him to tap into a more creative part of his work, instead of just producing objects that he intended to sell.",
      "\u201cI have been sculpting since I was a young child,\" said Kant\u00e9, who comes from a long line of sculptors. \u201cEvery artist wants to get better.\u201d",
      "But it also gave his work recognition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s because of the Biennale that people know my work,\" he said. If you participate in the Biennale, he added, \u201cyou are proud.\"",
      "Bass\u00e8ne, the curator, grew up in Medina, next to Soumbedioune, but is now based in Paris. He said he wanted to bridge the divide between arts and crafts.",
      "\u201cThis is the first time in the history that artisans, especially those who are custodians of traditional craftsmanship, are invited to the Biennale,\u201d Bass\u00e8ne said. \u201cFor craftsmen in Africa, there is a natural progression towards the world of modern design.\u201d",
      "It was \u201cnormal,\u201d he said, to include artisans in the Biennale \u201cif we wanted to try to decolonize a little.\u201d",
      "This year's Biennale is being held as Senegal is undergoing profound political change, with the newly elected authorities charting a more self-reliant and pan-African course.",
      "Last month, the governing party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in legislative elections. Its win granted President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign to improve living conditions for ordinary Senegalese \u2014 including greater economic self-reliance, revamping the fishing industry, and making maximum use of natural resources.",
      "The theme of this year's Biennale has been \u201cThe Wake,\u201d alluding to the emancipation of the African continent from its remaining dependence on former colonial powers.",
      "The new government of Senegal has \u201ca transformational agenda,\u201d said Bass\u00e8ne. \u201cI think that what we have experienced politically will impact all the social sciences and all art.\"",

      "Mexico has decided to increase its still strikingly low daily minimum wage by 12% next year",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico announced Wednesday that it will increase its still strikingly low daily minimum wage by 12% next year.",
      "But because the Mexican peso has dropped by 18% in value over the last year, the increase actually marks a slight drop in constant dollar terms.",
      "The three-party minimum wage commission, made up of government, labor and business representatives, announced the increase Wednesday. It will take effect starting Jan. 1 2025.",
      "The new daily minimum wage will be about 279 pesos, or about $13.75. The 2024 wage of 249 pesos per day was worth $14.25 when it was announced in December 2023, but in that time the peso has dropped in value against the U.S. dollar, from 17.20 then to around 20.30 now.",
      "Domestic inflation in Mexico is currently running around 4.75%, so Wednesday's announcement could work out to a real-term increase of about 7%, unless inflation heats up.",
      "That is still only about $1.71 per hour, compared to a U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. However, many U.S. states have minimum wage rates that range from $10 to $16 per hour.",
      "Because living costs are higher along Mexico's northern border with the United States, the official minimum wage is higher there. For 2025, it will be set at around 420 pesos, or $20.70 per day."

    "story": [
      "UNESCO has inscribed ethnic Slovak na\u00efve paintings from a village in Serbia on its list of intangible cultural heritage",
      "KOVACICA, Serbia -- Nearly a century ago, two farmers in an ethnic Slovak village in northern Serbia started painting to pass the time during the long winter months. This week, their art is being inscribed on UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list.",
      "The farmers' paintings and those of others from the village of Kovacica are what is known as na\u00efve art \u2014 a form that depicts everyday scenes, landscapes, village life and farm surroundings with a childlike simplicity.",
      "With their bright colors and folk motives, the self-taught na\u00efve painters of Kovacica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northeast of Belgrade, Serbia's capital, have developed a unique tradition among the country's ethnic Slovak minority.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve art in Kovacica began in 1939 when Martin Paluska and Jan Sokol started painting,\u201d explained Ana Zolnaj Barca, the head of the Gallery of Na\u00efve Art in the village. \u201cThey were farmers with only four grades of elementary school.\u201d",
      "Paluska and Sokol initially painted scenes they saw on postcards, such as Venetian gondolas or wild animals, explained Zolnaj Barca. But their art really bloomed over time, when they turned to their own surroundings rather than far-away lands, she said.",
      "The village's na\u00efve art gallery, established in 1955, now holds the works of nearly 50 recognized artists and hosts some 20,000 visitors each year.",
      "Among its most famous artists is Zuzana Chalupova, who often painted children and whose work was featured on millions of UNICEF postcards. Another Kovacica artist, Martin Jonas, depicted farmers with oversized hands and feet but small heads \u2014 meant to symbolize their hard-working life.",
      "And though the Kovacica style of na\u00efve paintings originated in the village, it has since spread far beyond the area.",
      "\u201cAn identifying factor, the practice is a means of transmitting the cultural heritage and history of the Slovak community in Serbia,\u201d UNESCO said in its citation.",
      "Serbia\u2019s government said Tuesday that the UNESCO decision to inscribe Kovacica's na\u00efve paintings confirms the Balkan nation\u2019s \u201cpromotion of cultural diversity.\u201d",
      "For gallerist and expert Pavel Babka, na\u00efve art represents a treasure chest of traditional ways and customs \u2014 he points to a painting in his gallery showing a girl in traditional Slovak multi-layered skirt being sent off to church alone for the first time.",
      "Another painting in Babka's gallery features a horse-drawn cart and a yellow house dating back to Austro-Hungarian times, testifying of the long presence of the ethnic Slovak community in what is today Serbia.",
      "Contemporary na\u00efve artists, Babka said, often also seek inspiration in the tales of the past and \u201cwould rather paint a horse than a tractor.\u201d",
      "Artist Stefan Varga, 65, agrees. He said he paints images based on the \u201cstories my grandmother told me from when she was a little girl.\"",
      "Those times weren't easy but they were \u201csimple and beautiful,\u201d he said.",
      "Varga\u2019s paintings feature cheerful, red-cheeked villagers in traditional clothes, bright colors, farm animals and huge pumpkins. The main characteristics of na\u00efve painting are \u201cjoy and purity, the purity of heart and colors,\" he said.",
      "\u201cNa\u00efve painters usually use simple colors,\u201d said Varga. They \u201cuse the simplest way to say what they want to say so everybody can understand them, whether they are Chinese, Japanese, English or Serb.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "South Korea\u2019s opposition parties moved to impeach the president over the shocking and short-lived declaration of martial law that drew heavily armed troops to encircle parliament",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s opposition parties moved Wednesday to impeach the president over the shocking and short-lived declaration of martial law that drew heavily armed troops to encircle parliament before lawmakers climbed walls to reenter the building and unanimously voted to lift his order.",
      "Impeaching Yoon Suk Yeol would require the support of two-thirds of parliament, and at least six justices of the nine-member Constitutional Court would have to endorse it to remove him. The motion to impeach, submitted jointly by the main liberal opposition Democratic Party and five smaller opposition parties, could be put to a vote as early as Friday.",
      "Yoon\u2019s senior policy advisers and Defense Minster Kim Yong Hyun offered to resign as the nation struggled to make sense of what appeared to be a poorly conceived stunt. The Democratic Party submitted a separate motion to impeach Kim, who allegedly recommended the martial law declaration to Yoon.",
      "In his speech announcing the abrupt order Tuesday night, Yoon vowed to eliminate \u201canti-state\u201d forces and continued to criticize the Democratic Party's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. But martial law lasted only about six hours, ending after the National Assembly voted to overrule Yoon and his Cabinet formally lifted it before daybreak Wednesday.",
      "Democratic Party lawmakers, who hold a majority in the 300-seat parliament, called on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "Yoon's martial law declaration \"was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn\u2019t abide by any requirements to declare it,\u201d a party statement said. The order \u201cwas originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\u201d",
      "Impeaching him would require support from 200 National Assembly members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats. But they could seek additional votes from Yoon\u2019s ruling conservative People Power Party.",
      "The 190-0 vote that rejected martial law included the votes of 18 lawmakers from the PPP, according to National Assembly officials. Party leader Han Dong-hun and Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon, also a member, criticized Yoon's martial law declaration.",
      "If Yoon is impeached, he will be stripped of his constitutional powers until the Constitutional Court rules. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, who holds the No. 2 position in the South Korean government, would take over presidential responsibilities. Han issued a public message pleading for patience and calling for Cabinet members to \u201cfulfill your duties even after this moment.\u201d",
      "The Constitutional Court has only six incumbent justices following three retirements. That means all six must approve the impeachment motion for it to succeed. The court includes justices appointed after Yoon took office, so the Democratic Party is expected to speed up the process of exercising its right to recommend two of the three new justices.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration, the first of its kind in more than 40 years, harkened back to South Korea\u2019s past military-backed governments when authorities occasionally proclaimed martial law and other decrees that allowed them to station soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles on streets or at public places such as schools to prevent anti-government demonstrations. Until Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, such scenes of military intervention had not been seen since South Korea achieved a democracy in the late 1980s.",
      "After Yoon\u2019s declaration, troops carrying full battle gear, including assault rifles, tried to keep protesters away from the National Assembly as military helicopters flew overhead and landed nearby. One soldier pointed his assault rifle at a woman who was among protesters outside the building demanding that the martial law be lifted.",
      "It wasn\u2019t clear how the 190 lawmakers were able to enter a parliamentary hall to vote down Yoon\u2019s martial law decree. Opposition leader Lee Jae-myung and National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik were seen climbing over walls. As troops and police officers blocked some from entering, they didn\u2019t aggressively restrain or use force against others.",
      "No major violence was reported. The troops and police personnel were later seen leaving the grounds of the National Assembly after the parliamentary vote to lift the martial law. Woo said: \u201cEven with our unfortunate memories of military coups, our citizens have surely observed the events of today and saw the maturity of our military.\u201d",
      "Under South Korea\u2019s constitution, the president can declare martial law during \u201cwartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\u201d that require the use of military force to restrict the freedom of press, assembly and other rights to maintain order. Many observers question whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "A presidential official said Yoon decided to impose martial law to resolve a political deadlock and did it in the middle of night to minimize its effect on the economy. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue.",
      "Some experts say Yoon clearly violated the constitution. While martial law allows \u201cspecial measures\u201d to restrict individual freedoms and the authority of agencies and courts, the constitution does not permit the functions of parliament to be restricted.",
      "But in following Yoon\u2019s declaration on Tuesday, the South Korean military proclaimed that parliamentary activities were suspended and deployed troops to try to block lawmakers from entering the National Assembly.",
      "Park Chan-dae, the Democratic Party\u2019s floor leader, called for Yoon to be immediately investigated on charges of rebellion over the way he deployed troops to the parliament. While the president mostly enjoys immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "In Seoul, the streets were busy Wednesday, like a normal weekday.",
      "Tourist Stephen Rowan, from Brisbane, Australia, who was touring Gyeongbokgung Palace, said he was not concerned. He heard about calls for the president\u2019s resignation and expected demonstrations.",
      "\"I would have been concerned if martial law had stayed enforced,\u201d he said.",
      "Natalia Slavney, research analyst at the Stimson Center\u2019s 38 North website, which focuses on Korean affairs, said Yoon\u2019s imposition of martial law was \u201ca serious backslide of democracy\u201d that followed a \u201cworrying trend of abuse\u201d since he took office in 2022.",

      "In 2019, a Chicago federal judge rejected a motion to dismiss the indictment against Firtash, who has argued that the U.S. has no jurisdiction over crimes in India. However, the judge ruled that it does, because any scheme would have impacted a Chicago-based company.",
      "American aviation company Boeing, based in Chicago, has said it considered business with Firtash but never followed through. It is not accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "He was arrested in Austria in 2014 and then freed on 125 million euros ($131 million) bail, kicking off the ongoing legal saga. A Vienna court initially ruled against extradition on the grounds that the indictment was politically motivated.",
      "A higher court in February 2017 rejected that reasoning as \u201cinsufficiently substantiated\u201d and ruled that Firtash could be extradited. Austria\u2019s Supreme Court of Justice upheld that ruling in 2019.",
      "The country\u2019s justice minister at the time approved the extradition, but a Vienna court judge ruled it could only take place after a decision on a defense call to reopen the case.

      "Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world\u2019s most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump rolls on",
      "NEW YORK -- Bitcoin has topped the $100,000 mark as a massive rally in the world's most popular cryptocurrency sparked by the election of Donald Trump rolls on.",
      "The milestone comes just hours after the President-elect signaled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry when he said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election Nov. 5. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from $69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. Just two years ago, bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "How long bitcoin will stay above the $100,000 mark is uncertain. It fell back to just under $102,000 early Thursday. As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players have welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.",
      "Trump made a move in that direction Wednesday when he said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry, penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. But he\u2019s also faced criticism from industry players in the process, like the chief legal officer of Robinhood, who described Gensler\u2019s approach toward crypto as \u201crigid\u201d and \u201chostile.\u201d Gensler will step down when Trump takes office.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The Spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before the election \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.",
      "\u201cI would say, keep it simple. And don\u2019t take on more risk than you can afford to,\u201d said Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, adding that there isn\u2019t a \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d to know for certain what comes next.",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\u201d which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections"

      "The three-party minimum wage commission, made up of government, labor and business representatives, announced the increase Wednesday. It will take effect starting Jan. 1 2025.",
      "The new daily minimum wage will be about 279 pesos, or about $13.75. The 2024 wage of 249 pesos per day was worth $14.25 when it was announced in December 2023, but in that time the peso has dropped in value against the U.S. dollar, from 17.20 then to around 20.30 now.",

      "That is still only about $1.71 per hour, compared to a U.S. federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. However, many U.S. states have minimum wage rates that range from $10 to $16 per hour.",
      "Because living costs are higher along Mexico's northern border with the United States, the official minimum wage is higher there. For 2025, it will be set at around 420 pesos, or $20.70 per day.",

      "Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta says it will build a $10 billion artificial intelligence data center in northeast Louisiana",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The largest artificial intelligence data center ever built by Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta is coming to northeast Louisiana, the company said Wednesday, bringing hopes that the $10 billion facility will transform an economically neglected corner of the state.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry called it \u201cgame-changing\u201d for his state's expanding tech sector, yet some environmental groups have raised concerns over the center's reliance on fossil fuels \u2014 and whether the plans for new natural gas power to support it could lead to higher energy bills in the future for Louisiana residents.",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is expanding its existing supercomputer project in Memphis, Tennessee, the city's chamber of commerce said Wednesday. The chamber also said that Nvidia, Dell, and Supermicro Computer will be \u201cestablishing operations in Memphis,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "Louisiana is among a growing number of states offering tax credits and other incentives to lure big tech firms seeking sites for energy-intensive data centers.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department found that there aren\u2019t enough data centers in the U.S. to meet the rising AI-fueled demand, which is projected to grow by 9% each year through 2030, citing industry reports.",
      "Meta anticipates its Louisiana data center will create 500 operational jobs and 5,000 temporary construction jobs, said Kevin Janda, director of data center strategy. At 4 million square feet (370,000 square meters), it will be the company's largest AI data center to date, he added.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we are having a positive impact on the local level,\u201d Janda said.",
      "Congressional leaders and local representatives from across the political spectrum heralded the Meta facility as a boon for Richland parish, a rural part of Louisiana with a population of 20,000 historically reliant on agriculture. About one in four residents are considered to live in poverty and the parish has an employment rate below 50%, according to the U.S. census data.",
      "Meta plans to invest $200 million into road and water infrastructure improvements for the parish to offset its water usage. The facility is expected to be completed in 2030.",
      "Entergy, one of the nation's largest utility providers, is fast-tracking plans to build three natural gas power plants in Louisiana capable of generating 2,262 megawatts for Meta's data center over a 15-year period \u2014 nearly one-tenth of Entergy's existing energy capacity across four states.",
      "The Louisiana Public Service Commission is weighing Entergy's proposal as some environmental groups have opposed locking the state into more fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Meta said it plans to help bring 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy onto the grid in the future.",
      "Louisiana residents may ultimately end up with rate increases to pay off the cost of operating these natural gas power plants when Meta's contract with Entergy expires, said Jessica Hendricks, state policy director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana-based nonprofit advocating for energy consumers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why residential customers in Louisiana need to pay for a power plant for energy that they\u2019re not going to use,\" Hendricks said. \"And we want to make sure that there\u2019s safeguards in place.\u201d",
      "Public service commissioner Foster Campbell, representing northeast Louisiana, said he does not believe the data center will increase rates for Louisiana residents and views it as vital for his region.",

      "Environmental groups have also warned of the pollution generated by Musk's AI data center in Memphis. The Southern Environmental Law Center, among others, says the supercomputer could strain the power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency. Eighteen gas turbines currently running at xAI\u2019s south Memphis facility are significant sources of ground-level ozone, better known as smog, the group said.",

But Obama\u2019s memoir was available through all major outlets and Circana\u2019s tracking for \u201cEras Tour Book\u201d accounts only for its first weekend sales.",

      "She noted that because the hack appeared to be targeting a relatively small group of individuals, only a small number of Americans' phone calls and texts have been compromised. Neuberger added that impacted companies are all responding, but none \u201chave fully removed the Chinese actors from these networks.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo there is a risk of ongoing compromises to communications until U.S. companies address the cybersecurity gaps the Chinese are likely to maintain their access,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "She said that President Joe Biden has been briefed on the findings and that the White House \u201chas made it a priority for the federal government to do everything it can to get to the bottom this.\u201d",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington on Tuesday rejected the accusations that it was responsible for the hack after the U.S. federal authorities issued new guidance.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said.",
      "The embassy did not immediately respond to messages on Wednesday.",
      "White House officials believe that the hacking was regionally targeted and the focus was on very senior government officials.",
      "Federal authorities confirmed in October that hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The number of countries impacted by the hack is currently believed to be in the \u201clow, couple dozen,\u201d according to a senior administration official.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said they believed the hacks started at least a year or two ago.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions.",
      "If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the operation, which has been dubbed Salt Typhoon, and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, experts say.",
      "Neuberger pointed to efforts that have been made to beef up cybersecurity in the rail, aviation, energy and other sectors following the May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.",
      "\u201cSo, to prevent ongoing Salt typhoon type intrusions by China, we believe we need to apply a similar minimum cybersecurity practice,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "The cyberattack by a gang of criminal hackers on the critical U.S. pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel used along the Eastern Seaboard, sent ripple effects across the economy, highlighting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s aging energy infrastructure. Colonial confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems as it scrambled to get the nation's fuel pipeline back online.",

      "A California farm has expanded a recall of raw milk sold in stores and has halted production",
      "A California farm expanded a recall of raw milk sold in stores and halted production after state health and agriculture officials found bird flu virus in more milk samples.",
      "Raw Farm, of Fresno, voluntarily recalled all whole milk and cream products from stores late Tuesday after tests found bird flu virus in \u201cmultiple\u201d retail samples and dairy storage and bottling sites. The recall covers all Raw Farm milk and cream produced between Nov. 9 and Nov. 27.",
      "The California Department of Food and Agriculture quarantined the farm and suspended distribution of raw milk, cream, kefir, butter and cheese products produced on or after Nov. 27.",
      "\u201cCalifornians are strongly encouraged not to consume any raw milk or cream products in their possession or still on store shelves,\u201d officials said in a statement.",
      "The move followed recalls of two lots of Raw Farm products after bird flu was first detected in retail milk on Nov. 21.",
      "No known cases of bird flu virus have been confirmed in people who drank raw milk, health officials said. Pasteurized milk is heat-treated to kill the virus and remains safe to drink.",
      "Pet owners also should avoid feeding Raw Farm products sold nationwide as \u201cpet food topper\u201d or \u201cpet food kefir\u201d to their animals, who can become ill, health officials said. Cats on farms with infected cows have developed brain damage and died after drinking contaminated raw milk.",
      "Bird flu virus, also known as Type A H5N1 avian influenza, was detected for the first time in U.S. dairy cows in March. The virus has been spreading rapidly, particularly in California, where nearly 500 of the more than 700 infected U.S. herds have been detected.",
      "The virus has infected 57 people in the U.S. this year, including 31 in California, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mild illnesses have been seen in dairy and poultry workers who had close contact with infected animals. In two cases, an adult in Missouri and a child in California, no known source of the illnesses have been identified. No cases of bird flu spreading between people have been detected in the U.S.",
      "Health officials have long warned against drinking raw milk because it can contain germs that cause illnesses that range from mild to life-threatening.",
      "Raw Farm\u2019s owner, Mark McAfee, has called for less raw milk regulation. In an Instagram post on Wednesday, farm officials said they were working to restore supply quickly.",
      "\u201cThere are no illnesses associated with H5N1 in our products.

We are working towards resolving this political issue while being cooperative with our government regulatory agencies.\u201d",
      "Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who has been tapped as the nation's top health official, has vowed to allow wider distribution of raw milk.

    "story": [
      "Lawmakers from states with legalized gambling are proposing standards for other states that are considering allowing internet betting",
      "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. -- Lawmakers from states where gambling is legal are proposing standards for additional states that are considering allowing internet gambling, including a tax rate of 15% to 25%, and a ban on credit card deposits.",
      "The National Council of Legislators from Gaming States issued model legislation last week for states that are weighing whether to permit internet gambling. The proposal will be discussed at the group's winter meeting in New Orleans next week.",
      "It is designed to give them a framework around which to build their own legislation while incorporating things that have been working well in other states.",
      "Seven U.S. states currently offer legal online casino games: Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Nevada offers internet poker but not online casino games.",
      "\u201cMany states have been discussing this, but were having a hard time getting it across the finish line,\u201d said Shaun Fluharty, a West Virginia Democratic state delegate who serves as president of the national legislators group. \u201cWe're trying to put together some best practices for them.\u201d",
      "The proposed legislation is modeled closely on laws that have been operating in states including New Jersey, which has been a leader in approving and regulating internet gambling since 2013. David Rebuck, the retired head of New Jersey's Division of Gaming Enforcement, advised the lawmakers\u2019 group on the proposed legislation.",
      "\u201cNinety-five percent of this mirrors what we're already doing in New Jersey, which is good,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's a great start that builds on what is already in place and operational elsewhere.\u201d",
      "It calls for strict oversight of internet gambling to protect consumers and weed out unsavory individuals and companies. The proposal also calls for the establishment of a government agency to regulate online wagering if one does not already exist.",
      "It would limit deposits to $20,000 in any 24-hour period and prohibit the use of credit cards to fund gambling accounts.",
      "A suggested tax rate of 15% to 25% is a starting point for discussions, Fluharty said. That range is above what some states charge, but far less than others, such as Pennsylvania, which taxes online sports betting at 36% and online slot machine games at 54%.",
      "Fluharty said the national average for online gambling tax rates is 19%. West Virginia taxes them at 15%.",
      "\u201cThe thinking was we didn't want to form a barrier to entry into the market with a high tax rate that only the biggest companies could afford,\u201d he said.",
      "Fluharty said Maryland has been trying to enact internet gambling, which made it through the House but not the Senate in April. He also said other states including Ohio and Louisiana have been considering their own online gambling measures. New York lawmakers have been trying to enact online casino gambling with a 31.5% tax rate without success but did allow online sports betting.",
      "Rebuck predicted that more states will give internet gambling a serious look in the new year as budget pressures mount.",
      "\u201cA number of states are being cautious about their budgets, and if they're looking at this as a potential revenue driver, it's pretty significant,\u201d he said.",
      "New Jersey's 13% tax on online sports betting and 15% tax on online casino games brought in over $414 million in tax revenue last year. It has nearly matched that figure through just the first 10 months of this year.",
      "The group's proposal does not attempt to set national standards. Gambling is largely regulated by states, and sporadic attempts to enact nationwide laws on it have gone nowhere in recent years.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly said he favors letting states decide important questions. During his first term as president, Trump did not act to impose nationwide regulations on the gambling industry of which he once was a member, with three casinos in Atlantic City.",

But it has been criticized, including by Labour supporters, for failing to show people how their lives will improve any time soon.",
      "The speech will set out \u201cmilestones\u201d for measuring progress on economic growth, clean energy, reforming childcare and education, bolstering the NHS and cutting crime. It includes a pledge of 13,000 more neighborhood police officers within five years.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \u201cproven leader for common sense regulations.\u201d In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\u201cHe believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. The value of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, passed $100,000 Wednesday. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\u201d Grewal wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\u201d",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019d probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\u201d",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \u201crestore faith in the SEC.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\u201d McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",
      "Crypto industry players welcomed Trump\u2019s victory in the hopes that he would push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for.",
      "Trump himself has launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies."

      "Ten months ago, they knocked off a No. 1 Connecticut 85-66. That was UConn's last loss before winning 13 in a row the way to its second straight national championship.",
      "Five of the Creighton players on the court against the Jayhawks also played against the Huskies, including 7-foot-1 center Ryan Kalkbrenner. The Big East preseason player of the year came back from injury to score 17 points and outperform Kansas big man Hunter Dickinson. Kalkbrenner had 15 points against UConn last February.",
      "\u201cBoth feel great, obviously,\" Kalkbrenner said. \"Both those teams, UConn and Kansas, are elite, high-level programs. We were able to execute the game plan in both games and played at a high level. You feel good about those wins.\u201d",
      "A raucous crowd was involved from the opening tip against KU, the noise level increasing every time Pop Isaacs swished one of his six 3-pointers and Kalkbrenner flushed lob passes for dunks. At the final buzzer, students poured out of the end zone seats onto the court as flames shot out of the goal standards.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t quite had a moment like that in college,\u201d Isaacs said. \u201cI haven't played against the No. 1 team in the country. I've played against No. 2 and No. 3. It was hyped. The students showed up and it was electric out there. That wasn't the first court storming I've been in. It was the biggest one.\"",
      "Isaacs was well familiar with the way Kansas plays defense from the two seasons he played at Texas Tech, and he said that was an advantage. He scored a season-high 27 points.",
      "\u201cI saw the ball go through the basket,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst shot went in. It felt good coming off my hands. I felt I had some really good looks tonight. Like Coach says, I'm a really good shooter when I take the right shots, and I took the right shots tonight for the most part.\u201d",

      "McDermott indicated that beating Kansas meant a little more to him than beating UConn even though the Huskies are a Big East opponent. McDermott grew up in Iowa paying attention to the Jayhawks, and he coached four seasons at Iowa State and never could beat Bill Self and the Jayhawks. In fact, he was 0-10 against KU before Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI've been watching Kansas basketball forever,\" McDermott said. \"Back to coach Williams and then coach Self, they're one of the best. We had some close calls at Hilton when I was at Iowa State where we walked out of Hilton (Coliseum) disappointed we couldn't get the job done against a good Kansas team. To finally beat them when they had a great team and they're ranked No. 1 in the country, it's great for our guys and great for our fans.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Kirk Cousins is set for his return on Sunday to Minnesota, his NFL home from 2018 through 2023",
      "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. -- This was not the homecoming scenario Kirk Cousins would have scripted.",
      "Cousins' return to Minnesota, his NFL home from 2018 through 2023, on Sunday comes as he is hearing speculation about his job security in Atlanta. Cousins has thrown six interceptions with no touchdowns in the Falcons' three-game losing streak. That includes four picks in last week's 17-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, his most in a decade.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the challenge always in pro football to be able to get back up off the mat and get back going,\u201d Cousins said after Wednesday's practice.",
      "A vote of confidence from coach Raheem Morris can't silence suggestions that it's time to give rookie first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. a chance to jump-start the Falcons' struggling offense. Morris said Sunday he didn't consider removing Cousins from the game, and he repeated his support for the veteran on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cGot to go to Minnesota and get a big-time win and Kirk\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Morris said before acknowledging Cousins must bounce back from \u201cobviously a tough game.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou know, realistically, man he is built for this and he\u2019s ready to go,\u201d Morris said.",
      "The losing streak has left the Falcons (6-6) struggling to remain on top of the weak NFC South. They hold the tiebreaker advantage with Tampa Bay (6-6), but need Cousins to end his turnover streak.",
      "Cousins, 36, was expected to be the reliable leader on offense after he signed a four-year, $180 million contract. He will be in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. He said he expects a loud reception from Minnesota's fans.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re great fans, great football fans,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cAs a result I think they\u2019ll make it as hostile as they can for us.\u201d",
      "Cousins ranks fifth in the league with 3,052 passing yards. He has 17 touchdown passes and his 13 interceptions are only one shy of his career high.",
      "Cousins insists he feels strong in his return from last season's torn Achilles tendon. He was critical of his mental mistakes in the loss to the Chargers. He said he rushed some passes, sometimes lacking the necessary velocity on his throws and giving defensive backs the opportunity to step in front of receivers for interceptions.",
      "Atlanta offensive coordinator Zac Robinson also said Cousins' lack of velocity on his throws \u201cjust goes back to, you know, decisiveness, being decisive when you do cut it loose. Certainly those things happen with quarterbacks. There might be times where, you know, you\u2019re not as convicted on a throw. And it shows by the way the football comes out.\u201d",
      "Morris said he still has confidence in Cousins' arm and the mental side to his game.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s done a great job with us, and I have no real qualms about him bouncing back and him being able to play the game the way it needs to be done,\u201d Morris said. \u201cHe\u2019s still an elite processor. He has the ability to make all the throws. He\u2019s shown that throughout the year.\u201d",
      "Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores also said he expects Cousins will shake out of his slump.",
      "\u201cI know the narrative is he had a tough game last week, but he\u2019s played some good football,\" Flores said. \"I think the people in this building know what Kirk can do. He\u2019s a very, very good quarterback.\u201d",
      "Added Flores: \u201cHe\u2019s a bounce-back type of guy, as we all know. I\u2019m expecting his best, the best version of Kirk, the best version of that offense. It\u2019s going to be a major challenge for us.\u201d",
      "Atlanta's offensive production has dipped while the veteran quarterback\u2019s turnovers have been on the rise. The Falcons were held to under 20 points in each of their three straight losses.",
      "\u201cHave to just believe that tough times don\u2019t last, tough people do,\u201d Cousins said. \u201cYou have to keep pushing.\u201d",

      "Western Kentucky, Boise State, Miami and Georgia will be going for sweeps.",
      "Since 2000, there have been 78 same-season rematches in the FBS, with 43 sweeps and 35 splits, according to Sportradar.",
      "The rematch that will attract the most eyeballs is the SEC game. Georgia, then ranked fifth in The Associated Press Top 25, knocked off then-No. 1 Texas 30-15 in Austin on Oct. 19. Both teams have downplayed the rematch angle this week.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be a challenge, but we\u2019re definitely up for it,\u201d Georgia safety Dan Jackson said.",
      "Texas running back Quintrevion Wisner said no two games are alike and that he's excited about the matchup.",

      "The picks, with Associated Press Top 25 rankings and lines on FBS games from BetMGM Sportsbook:",
      "This will be the teams' second meeting in seven days. Western Kentucky won 19-17 at home on a late field goal last week, ending Jacksonville State's eight-game win streak. The Gamecocks are in the championship game in their second season as an FBS member.",
      "Pick: Jacksonville State 27-24.",
      "Winner is virtually assured of getting the Group of Five bid for the College Football Playoff. Rebels won 10 games for the first time in 40 years but are 0-7 all-time against Boise State, including a 29-24 loss in Las Vegas on Oct. 25.",
      "Pick: Boise State 29-26.",
      "Army QB Bryson Daily is running for 135 yards per game, best in the conference, and 5.7 per carry. In last week's loss to Memphis, Tulane gave up 236 yards rushing and a season-high 11 runs of 10-plus yards, and its offense managed just 57 on the ground, 166 under its average.",
      "Pick: Army 31-24.",
      "Neither team was expected to be here \u2014 especially the Sun Devils, who were the preseason pick to finish last in the conference. A close game could be decided by a big play. That favors Arizona State. Cam Skattebo picks up yards in chunks; the Cyclones are prone to giving up long runs.",
      "Pick: Arizona State 30-27.",
      "The teams have split four meetings over the last four seasons. Miami's 30-20 win on Oct. 19 is part of the RedHawks' current seven-game win streak following a 1-4 start. Miami QB Brett Gabbert has thrown for 16 TDs against three interceptions during the win streak.",
      "Pick: Miami (Ohio) 28-21.",
      "The winner gets an automatic CFP bid and first-round bye; the loser almost certainly gets an at-large berth. Texas will be looking for a better start after losing 30-15 in October. The Bulldogs turned three early Texas turnovers into 17 points and led 23-0 at half. Wisner, the Texas RB, has 344 yards over his last two games.",
      "Pick: Texas 33-27.",
      "Ragin' Cajuns' QB Ben Woodridge is the conference's highest-rated passer and leads an offense that has been held under 400 yards just once. Marshall QB Braylon Braxton is a dual threat who led the Herd back from a 17-point deficit to clinch a spot in the title game with a double-overtime win over James Madison last week.",
      "Pick: Louisiana-Lafayette 38-31.",
      "The first meeting of these teams since the 1995 Rose Bowl is for the Big Ten's automatic CFP bid and first-round bye. An at-large almost certainly goes to the loser. Penn State's James Franklin, 1-13 against top-five opponents, gets another chance on the big stage. Ducks look ready to get physical after running for 222 yards and five TDs and recording 10 sacks against Washington.",
      "Pick: Oregon 30-21.",
      "The three-loss Tigers can play as if they have nothing to lose because they weren't even supposed to be in this game. Syracuse's upset of Miami got them in.

      "Both teams are coming off wins on Thanksgiving. The Packers lost at home to the Lions a month ago and need this victory to have a chance at winning the NFC North. Detroit survived a close call last week thanks to Chicago\u2019s clock mismanagement. The Lions can\u2019t slip up with streaking Philadelphia right behind them for the No. 1 seed in the NFC. They are 5-1 against the spread in their past six games vs. Green Bay. The Packers are 1-6 ATS in their past seven games in Detroit. The road team has won the past four games in this series.",

      "A miserable season for the Jaguars keeps getting worse. Trevor Lawrence returned from an injury only to suffer a concussion on a late hit. The team is heading toward another top draft pick. They picked No. 1 overall in 2021 and 2022. The Titans are only slightly better. QB Will Levis has shown improvement over the past four games after returning from a shoulder injury.

      "The Panthers pushed the Chiefs to the final seconds before losing and were a fumble away from beating the Buccaneers in overtime last week. Bryce Young has improved since returning from his benching and rookie coach Dave Canales has the team playing better than its record. The Eagles are a legitimate Super Bowl contender behind MVP candidate Saquon Barkley, a loaded offense and a stingy defense. They can\u2019t afford a letdown with hopes of catching the Lions for the No. 1 seed in the NFC.",

They lost to Jameis Winston and the Browns in snow-filled Cleveland in Week 12. Winston was at his best and worst in a Monday night loss to Denver. T.J. Watt and Pittsburgh\u2019s defense will be ready for him. The Browns are 4-10 ATS in their past 14 games and 1-19 straight up in their past 20 games in Pittsburgh.",

They\u2019re 8-4 ATS this season and 1-1 as home favorites. Kyler Murray has 1,037 yards passing, 195 yards rushing, seven TD passes and one interception for a 102.9 passer rating in his past four home starts vs. Seattle.

      "The Chargers have lost six straight to the Chiefs, including a 17-10 loss at home on Sept. 29. Jim Harbaugh has built a tough, physical team that\u2019s in position to make the playoffs. The two-time defending champion Chiefs are barely winning games, with five going down to the final play. They should\u2019ve lost last week but the Raiders botched the clock. Justin Herbert and the rest of Los Angeles\u2019 offense need to get on track after winning a game without an offensive TD. The Chiefs have been vulnerable on defense lately.",

It\u2019s rare to see a team with a .333 winning percentage favored on the road against an opponent with a better record. That\u2019s the Burrow effect. It helps to have Ja\u2019Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, too. The Cowboys have shown fight in consecutive wins over the Commanders and Giants.

      "LONDON -- London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, the gilded concert venue known for an annual \u201cRule Britannia\u201d singalong, is preparing to host a different kind of spectacle: Sumo wrestling.",
      "Camera shutters clicked furiously and reporters \u201cahhhed\u201d in delight Wednesday as wrestlers Daisuke Kitanowaka and Akira Fukutsuumi demonstrated a sideways stamp and put on an exhibition of heavyweight grappling to promote a tournament scheduled for next October.",
      "It marks only the second time an elite five-day tournament will be held outside Japan. The first was in 1991 at the same venue.",
      "Organizers are hoping to whip up the kind of excitement that was generated three decades ago, when the deeply ritualistic sport attracted sell-out crowds and a national television audience.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just an event here at the hall,\u2019\u2019 said James Ainscough, chief executive of the Royal Albert Hall. \u201cIt became a national moment. People talked about it in the workplace. You could see kids acting it out each day in playgrounds the length and breadth of the country. So it\u2019s a huge honor and a huge matter of excitement to welcome it back in 2025.\u2019\u2019",
      "A variety of factors, including a series of sumo wrestling scandals, the financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, delayed the sport\u2019s return to London. But organizers believe the time is right because sumo is having a bit of a moment.",
      "Two Netflix series have introduced audiences to the intricacies of the sport, which has roots stretching back 1,500 years. Earlier this year, Hanshin Contents Link opened a sumo hall in Osaka, Japan\u2019s third-largest city, that entertains foreign tourists with explanatory exhibitions and actual bouts.",
      "Organizers of the London event say they hope to show Japan\u2019s rich culture as well as its traditional sport that pits two huge men clad in very little against each other in a test of strength and technique.",
      "On hand Wednesday was the winner of the previous U.K. tournament, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, nicknamed \u201cbulldog\u2019\u2019 by British fans in 1991. Now the chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, he reminisced about how the only thing that made him really nervous was preparing for a victory speech in English.",
      "Japan\u2019s ambassador to the U.K., Hiroshi Suzuki, also made an appearance, a reflection of the event's importance to the nation. Organizers promised that spectators also would see exhibitions of Kabuki theater and other Japanese traditions.",
      "But the main attraction were the wrestlers.",
      "Kitanowaka and Fukutsuumi gamely tried to show off their sport. Clad in their mawashi, or ceremonial aprons, they faced off on a mat in front of several dozen journalists. The big men slammed into each other with an \u201coomph\u201d as flesh slapped flesh. A grunt or two broke the silence.",
      "No sweat was evident. It was over in a flash.",
      "Then they went outside, dropping their robes and exposing their flesh to the frosty November air as they entered and exited a classic London black cab for photographers.",
      "Nothing seemed to bother them. Not the cold. Not the demands to stand this way or that. As the concert hall loomed behind them, they did their best to be sumo diplomats.",
      "\u201cSumo has a wonderfully intriguing collection of culture and ritual and sport and excitement,\u2019\u2019 Ainscough said. \u201cAnd to bring sumo back to the Royal Albert Hall again doesn\u2019t just create a sporting moment, it creates a moment where we can learn and be inspired by another culture and another set of principles to live by. It\u2019s a moment where we can all grow closer together.\u2019\""

      "The Capitals fell to 4-2-1 since captain and leading goal-scorer Alex Ovechkin was sidelined by a broken left fibula. They fell behind early and failed to make it five comeback victories in a row, despite Logan Thompson making 29 saves and Nic Dowd scoring his seventh goal of the season.",
      "Blackwood was dominant at the other end, turning aside quality chances and keeping Washington off the scoreboard on three power plays. Tyler Toffoli scored with one minute left in the first period, and the Sharks won their third in a row.",
      "Rookie Macklin Celebrini picked up the secondary assist on Eklund's OT winner to extend his point streak to five games. The top pick in the draft has four goals and four assists during this stretch.",
      "Sharks: They were far more prepared from the drop of the puck, and that paid off with Toffoli's goal. Coach Ryan Warsofsky's young, rebuilding team built some good habits that should benefit them in the long run.",
      "Capitals: On a positive note, they did not allow four or more goals, as they have in the past three games. But they also lost their recent scoring touch, failing to adjust to the shots Blackwood was stopping with some ease.",
      "With 2:17 left, Celebrini drew a 4-minute double-minor penalty for high-sticking on Tom Wilson to put the Sharks on the power play. That carried over into overtime, and Eklund scored on the 4-on-3 advantage.",
      "The Sharks have won eight of their past 11 games in Washington.",
      "The Sharks continue their road trip Thursday at Tampa Bay, while the Capitals visit Toronto on Friday.",

      "Athletic directors at Iowa State and SMU are in a turf war over the latest College Football Playoff rankings, leading to a \u201cstay off my lawn\" moment on social media.",
      "The background: SMU, at 11-1 and riding a nine-game winning streak into the Atlantic Coast Conference title game, was slotted at No. 8 in Tuesday night's latest ranking. Iowa State, meanwhile, is at 16th and playing for the title of the Big 12, which appears set to receive only one bid in the 12-team field that comes out Sunday.",
      "Cyclones AD Jamie Pollard doesn't like that, and made his feelings clear on X, formerly known as Twitter. He pointed out that SMU hasn't played Clemson, Syracuse, Georgia Tech or Miami \u2014 four of the ACC's top seven teams \u2014 and lost at home to BYU of the Big 12.",
      "\u201cLooks like your lawn may be artificial,\u201d Pollard wrote in a post directed to SMU's AD, Rick Hart.",
      "Hart mowed down Pollard with a response of his own that started with \u201crespect you, but bad take.\u201d",
      "He compared nonconference schedules \u2014 SMU's was better \u2014 and pointed out the Mustangs have trailed for only about six minutes of their last nine games.",
      "\u201cI could go on ... Stay off my lawn!\u201d he posted.",
      "Iowa State appears to be in a win-or-else mode, while SMU's fate is a little less clear.",
      "If the Mustangs lose to No. 17 Clemson, the CFP selection committee will have to decide how much to penalize a team that made a title game, while others in contention did not. The choice could, for instance, pit SMU against Alabama, which is ranked 11th and is the last team in this week's projected bracket.",
      "Of course, some of these differences will be settled on the field Saturday. Pollard, the Iowa State AD, conceded as much by opening his salvo to Hart with this olive branch: \u201cRick, beat Clemson Saturday and I will respect your ranking,\u201d he said.",

      "Having already announced last month that she was coming out of retirement, Vonn will race lower-level FIS downhills and super-Gs on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, in Copper Mountain, Colorado, U.S. Ski Team head coach Paul Kristofic told The Associated Press.",
      "Vonn needs some decent results to improve her long-dormant ranking so she can enter World Cup races this season under a new wild card rule.",
      "\u201cObviously her history speaks for itself and she\u2019s definitely the most decorated speed skier out there and has done amazing things throughout her career,\u201d Kristofic said Wednesday. \u201cSo it will be really, really fun and interesting to see what she can do.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s likely that many of the current World Cup racers will be competing alongside Vonn at Copper Mountain.",
      "Vonn is a three-time Olympic medalist, including a downhill gold at the 2010 Vancouver Games.",
      "Her 82 World Cup race victories stood as the record for a woman until that total was eclipsed in January 2023 by fellow American Mikaela Shiffrin, who is still active and is now up to 99 wins \u2014 more than any Alpine ski racer in the history of the sport.",
      "Vonn\u2019s last competition came in February 2019, after she dealt with a long series of injuries throughout her career.",
      "There were broken arms and legs, torn knee ligaments, concussions and more.",
      "Just this April, years after leaving the World Cup circuit, she had surgery for a partial knee replacement.",
      "During training at Copper Mountain with the rest of the U.S. team, Kristofic said Vonn's performance was \u201creally promising.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s getting better every time she goes out on the hill. It\u2019s been a lot of work to catch up after five years away. But she\u2019s motivated and pushing hard and I think really enjoying it, too,\u201d he said.",
      "Can Vonn be competitive right away?",
      "\u201cI think it will be a building process,\u201d Kristofic said. \u201cThe full race intensity is something that\u2019s difficult to replicate. But I think if she stays healthy and continues to improve the way she is, I think she will be competitive.\u201d",

      "Kevin Kisner is the next lead analyst for NBC Sports",
      "Kevin Kisner would not have guessed his stock was starting to rise as his golf game was starting to age.",
      "A year ago, he had finished out of the top 200 on the PGA Tour for the first time in 10 years as he struggled to find his form when NBC called and asked if he'd like to try his hand in the broadcast booth for The Sentry at Kapalua.",
      "On Wednesday, NBC Sports announced Kisner would be the lead analyst for its portfolio of golf coverage that includes two majors and the Ryder Cup.",
      "What makes Kisner with his homespun outlook and South Carolina drawl a good fit to follow Paul Azinger and Johnny Miller?",
      "\u201cI've wondered that myself,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cI think I offer a different perspective that is more player-centric. I'm not going to give you fluff because I've got an analyst's job. I'll tell it like it is. I'm not going to hinder my relationship with players, but I'll tell you if you hit a bad shot or make a bad decision.\u201d",
      "NBC had what amounted to a game of musical chairs since splitting with Azinger after the 2023 Ryder Cup outside Rome. Kisner, Brandel Chamblee of Golf Channel, Luke Donald, Paul McGinley and Brad Faxon all had stints in the chair next to lead announcer Dan Hicks. The network did not want to rush to fill the role permanently.",
      "The music stopped on Kisner.",
      "\u201cKevin always shared frank and honest opinions about the game of golf during our various conversations through the years,\u201d said Tommy Roy, the lead golf producer for NBC. \"Those kinds of opinions and his engaging personality make Kiz a great fit for our broadcast team. He knows these players, he knows this game, and the audience will get to hear more of those opinions and that personality this season.\u201d",
      "Kisner is not done with his own game. With just over $29 million in career earnings, he is using a one-time exemption from the PGA Tour career money list to be exempt for 2025.",
      "He is a four-time winner, including a World Golf Championship title at the Match Play and two other appearances in the championship match. He played in the Presidents Cups in 2017 and 2022 and was an assistant this year at Royal Montreal.",
      "The plan is for him to work 10 tournaments, which would include the U.S. Open and British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and The Players Championship. He is likely to play at least two events during the Florida swing that NBC broadcasts.",
      "He still considers himself a player and has seen signs that his swing is getting to where it was.",
      "\u201cThey were so supportive of that, and that's why I was willing to negotiate with them,\u201d Kisner said. \u201cThey want me there for the big events that I'm not exempt into, and they've been accommodating if I do get in. It's a great deal for me. NBC loves the idea that the weeks CBS is covering golf I'm playing, and hopefully playing great.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s fond of saying about golf, \u201cThis ain\u2019t no hobby.\u201d Even so, he likely will be in a far more prominent role in the NBC booth than inside the ropes next year.",

      "Aaron Rodgers figures his football resume speaks for itself",
      "Aaron Rodgers figures his football resume speaks for itself.",
      "So the New York Jets' quarterback doesn't feel the need to use the final stretch of this season to prove his value to the team and that he should be back next season. In fact, it's a notion the four-time NFL MVP finds \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf they want me to stay, fantastic,\u201d Rodgers said Wednesday. \"If it takes these five games, maybe they don\u2019t know what I bring to the table.",
      "\u201cBut that being said I\u2019d love to play really friggin' well the last five games.\u201d",
      "Rodgers, who turned 41 on Monday, has struggled with his production and health while the Jets have limped to a 3-9 start.",
      "He has dealt with leg injuries \u2014 a sprained ankle, a sore knee and a tweaked hamstring \u2014 for much of the season. But he came out of the bye-week break feeling the healthiest he had in weeks. Still, he was inconsistent in a 26-21 loss to Seattle and couldn't lead New York on a winning drive on its final possession.",
      "That had some speculating that the Jets could bench Rodgers in favor of Tyrod Taylor to perhaps spark the offense. Instead, interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said he was sticking with Rodgers as the starter as long as he's healthy, and the quarterback said during his weekly appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Tuesday his goal is to finish the season on the field \u2014 despite the team's woeful record.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you do when you\u2019re a professional and the most important ability you can have is availability, which I wasn\u2019t available last year,\u201d Rodgers said Wednesday, referring to going down with a torn Achilles tendon four snaps into his Jets debut. \u201cSo I\u2019d love to play the games and I love playing football. I\u2019m hyper-competitive and I love to be out there with the guys.\u201d",
      "He refused to use the injuries as an excuse for his subpar performance this season, saying he feels good enough to play if he's on the field. While Rodgers has thrown for 2,627 yards and 19 touchdowns with eight interceptions, his 6.3 yards-per-pass attempt is the lowest of his career as a starter.",
      "Rodgers said a few weeks ago that he thought he'd like to play next year, but recently amended that to say he wasn't sure. He said health would be a major factor \u2014 and if he did decide to play in 2025, the Jets would be his first choice.",
      "There's doubt as to whether the Jets will want him back as they rebuild with a new general manager and coach next season after the firings of Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh. Rodgers said some people have told him they hope he'll return, but \u201cnot the people who are making those decisions.\u201d",
      "That drew some laughs, but Rodgers said there will certainly be conversations \u2014 eventually \u2014 to determine his next move.",
      "\u201cI just redid my house here in Jersey,\u201d Rodgers said. \"My goal was to play a few more years here, but we\u2019ll see. I\u2019d like to be healthy, I\u2019d like to end on my feet and then I\u2019d like to play well and I\u2019d like to feel like I\u2019m wanted back. If not, again, I will not be offended. I won\u2019t be upset. I\u2019ll be so thankful, either way whatever happens here.",
      "\u201cBut I've got to be healthy mentally, physically, and then there\u2019s got to be interest on both sides. And if that\u2019s not the case, then I\u2019ll look at other options. But first, I\u2019ll think about whether I\u2019d actually want to play or not, but it usually takes a good month to get away from it, which I\u2019ll do the first month and then we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d",
      "During his appearance on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show,\u201d Rodgers highlighted the Detroit Lions \u2014 who were 3-13-1 in Dan Campbell's first year as coach in 2021 and are now tied with Kansas City for the best record in the NFL at 11-1 \u2014 as a team that benefited from patient and supportive ownership.",
      "After practice Wednesday, Rodgers was asked about those comments and whether he thinks the Jets have been similarly supportive.",
      "\"Is that a rhetorical question?\u201d he responded before explaining he was just citing an example. He added that he also saw support and a lack thereof at times during his 18 years in Green Bay.",
      "When asked if he felt there was support from Jets ownership, Rodgers said: \u201cI\u2019d have to look. I don\u2019t follow a lot of stuff. I\u2019d have to ask you guys: Has there been a lot of public, supportive comments?\u201d",
      "A reporter responded by pointing out the Jets' coach and GM firings.",
      "\u201cYeah,\" Rodgers said, \"so there's your answer.\u201d",

      "Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Oregon and Ohio State are all on track to earn playoff invitations, and those five schools also are atop the team recruiting standings. It represents one more example of how the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten have separated themselves from all the other leagues.",
      "Steve Wiltfong, vice president of recruiting and the transfer portal for On3, said it\u2019s apparent why those programs continue recruiting so well.",
      "\u201cFirst and foremost, those are the programs with the most resources,\u201d Wiltfong said. \u201cThey\u2019re the programs that are having the most success on the field and in the NFL draft.\u201d",
      "The order of those top classes remains in flux. The identity of the No. 1 class according to composite rankings of recruiting sites compiled by 247Sports may not be determined until Friday because of the uncertainty surrounding a couple of top-10 prospects.",

      "Most top recruits already committed to a school well before the signing period, continuing a trend that took effect from the time a December signing date was added in 2017 to the traditional February signing period. This year, that early signing period was moved up a few weeks so that it would take place before the transfer window opens Monday.",
      "This signing period also comes in the era of collectives and name, image and likeness opportunities allowing prospects to profit off their brand.

It's about what's the most money I can get. That's unfortunate, but it's the world we live in. You have to be able to adapt, and you have to be able to realign and be prepared.\u201d",

      "Oregon's class now includes three of the nation's top six cornerback prospects in Offord, Brandon Finney and Dorian Brew.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \u201cproven leader for common sense regulations.\u201d In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\u201cHe believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The commission oversees U.S. securities markets and investments and is currently led by Gary Gensler, who has been leading the U.S. government\u2019s crackdown on the crypto industry. Gensler, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, announced last month that he would be stepping down from his post on the day that Trump is inaugurated \u2014 Jan. 20, 2025.",
      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. The value of bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, passed $100,000 Wednesday. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\u201cWe appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\u201d Grewal wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\u201d",
      "Congressman Brad Sherman, a California Democrat and a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee, said he worries Atkins would not sufficiently regulate cryptocurrencies as SEC chair.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019d probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThe opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\u201d",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",
      "His work as an SEC commissioner started in 2002, a time when the fallout from corporate scandals at Enron and WorldCom had turned up the heat on Wall Street and its government regulators.",
      "Atkins was widely considered the most conservative member of the SEC during his tenure at the agency and known to have a strong free-market bent. As a commissioner, he called for greater transparency in and analysis of the costs and benefits of new SEC rules.",
      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",
      "U.S. Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Atkins has the experience needed to \u201crestore faith in the SEC.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m confident his leadership will lead to clarity for the digital asset ecosystem and ensure U.S. capital markets remain the envy of the world,\u201d McHenry posted on X.",
      "Atkins already has some experience working for Trump. During Trump's first term, Atkins was a member of the President\u2019s Strategic and Policy Forum, an advisory group of more than a dozen CEOs and business leaders who offered input on how to create jobs and speed economic growth.",
      "In 2017, Atkins joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization.",

      "The milestone comes just hours after the President-elect signaled a lighter regulatory approach to the crypto industry when he said he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to be the next chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Bitcoin has soared to unprecedented heights since Trump won the election Nov. 5. The cryptocurrency has climbed dramatically from $69,374 on Election Day and rose as high as $103,713 Wednesday, according to CoinDesk. Just two years ago, bitcoin dropped below $17,000 following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "How long bitcoin will stay above the $100,000 mark is uncertain. It fell back to just under $102,000 early Thursday. As with everything in the volatile cryptoverse, the future is impossible to predict. And while some are bullish on future gains, other experts continue to warn of investment risks.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know.",
      "Cryptocurrency has been around for a while now. But, chances are, you\u2019ve heard about it more and more over the last few years.",
      "In basic terms, cryptocurrency is digital money. This kind of currency is designed to work through an online network without a central authority \u2014 meaning it\u2019s typically not backed by any government or banking institution \u2014 and transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, although other assets like ethereum, tether and dogecoin have also gained popularity over the years. Some investors see cryptocurrency as a \u201cdigital alternative\u201d to traditional money, but the large majority of daily financial transactions are still conducted using fiat currencies such as the dollar. Also, bitcoin can be very volatile, with its price reliant on larger market conditions.",
      "A lot of the recent action has to do with the outcome of the U.S. presidential election.",
      "Trump, who was once a crypto skeptic, has pledged to make the U.S. \u201cthe crypto capital of the planet\u201d and create a \u201cstrategic reserve\u201d of bitcoin. His campaign accepted donations in cryptocurrency and he courted fans at a bitcoin conference in July. He also launched World Liberty Financial, a new venture with family members to trade cryptocurrencies.",
      "Crypto industry players have welcomed Trump\u2019s victory, in hopes that he would be able to push through legislative and regulatory changes that they\u2019ve long lobbied for \u2014 which, generally speaking, aim for an increased sense of legitimacy without too much red tape.",
      "Trump made a move in that direction Wednesday when he said he intends to nominate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins was an SEC commissioner during the presidency of George W. Bush. In the years since leaving the agency, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation. He joined the Token Alliance, a cryptocurrency advocacy organization, in 2017.",
      "Under current chair Gary Gensler, the SEC has cracked down on the crypto industry, penalizing a number of companies for violating securities laws. But he\u2019s also faced criticism from industry players in the process, like the chief legal officer of Robinhood, who described Gensler\u2019s approach toward crypto as \u201crigid\u201d and \u201chostile.\u201d Gensler will step down when Trump takes office.",
      "One crypto-friendly move the SEC did make under Gensler was the approval in January of spot bitcoin ETFs, or exchange trade funds, which allow investors to have a stake in bitcoin without directly buying it. The Spot ETFs were the dominant driver of bitcoin's price before the election \u2014 but, like much of the crypto\u2019s recent momentum, saw record inflows postelection.",
      "History shows you can lose money in crypto as quickly as you\u2019ve made it. Long-term price behavior relies on larger market conditions. Trading continues at all hours, every day.",
      "At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, bitcoin stood at just over $5,000. Its price climbed to nearly $69,000 by November 2021, during high demand for technology assets, but later crashed during an aggressive series of rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. And the late-2022 collapse of FTX significantly undermined confidence in crypto overall, with bitcoin falling below $17,000.",
      "Investors began returning in large numbers as inflation started to cool \u2014 and gains skyrocketed on the anticipation and then early success of spot ETFs. But experts still stress caution, especially for small-pocketed investors. And lighter regulation from the coming Trump administration could mean less guardrails.",
      "\u201cI would say, keep it simple. And don\u2019t take on more risk than you can afford to,\u201d said Adam Morgan McCarthy, a research analyst at Kaiko, adding that there isn\u2019t a \u201cmagic eight ball\u201d to know for certain what comes next.",
      "Assets like bitcoin are produced through a process called \u201cmining,\u201d which consumes a lot of energy. Operations relying on pollutive sources have drawn particular concern over the years.",
      "Recent research published by the United Nations University and Earth\u2019s Future journal found that the carbon footprint of 2020-2021 bitcoin mining across 76 nations was equivalent to the emissions from burning 84 billion pounds of coal or running 190 natural gas-fired power plants. Coal satisfied the bulk of bitcoin\u2019s electricity demands (45%), followed by natural gas (21%) and hydropower (16%).",
      "Environmental impacts of bitcoin mining boil largely down to the energy source used. Industry analysts have maintained that clean energy has increased in use in recent years, coinciding with rising calls for climate protections"

      "\u201cI\u2019m actually very optimistic this time around,\u201d Bezos said on stage during a wide-ranging interview at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York. \u201cHe seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. If I can help do that, I\u2019m going to help him.\"",
      "\u201cWe do have too many regulations in this country,\u201d Bezos added.",
      "The comments follow Bezos' October decision to prohibit The Washington Post, which he owns, from endorsing a presidential candidate, a move that led to tens of thousands of people canceling their subscriptions and protests from journalists with a deep history at the newspaper.",
      "At the time, Bezos wrote in an op-ed in the newspaper saying editorial endorsements create a perception of bias at a time when many Americans don\u2019t believe the media, and do nothing to tip the scales of an election.",
      "On Wednesday, he said he would try to talk Trump \"out of the idea\u201d that the press is the enemy.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve probably grown in the last eight years,\u201d he said to journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin. \u201cHe has, too. This is not the case. The press is not the enemy.\u201d",
      "Trump had railed against Bezos and his companies, including Amazon and The Washington Post, during his first term. In 2019, Amazon argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract. The Biden administration later pursued a contract with both Amazon and Microsoft.",
      "In another part of the interview, Bezos said he doesn't expect Elon Musk, who has been tasked with cutting regulations in the upcoming Trump term, to use his power to hurt his business competitors. Bezos owns Blue Origin, a rival to Musk's SpaceX."

The tour shattered sales and attendance records and created such an economic boom that even the Federal Reserve took note.",

      "Swift has long been known for leaving Easter eggs for her fans to pinpoint and decipher, a quirk that quickly took on a life of its own during the tour as eagle-eyed devotees began analyzing the possible meaning of her outfits, surprise songs and subtle lyric swaps. The buzz has been so large that multiple mobile apps were launched so fans could guess and track all the various changes. There\u2019s even a game that gives out prizes for correctly predicting various particulars of a show, including what color guitar Swift uses while playing \u201cLover.\u201d",
      "\u201cImagine your favorite sports team,\u201d Bohne said. \u201cThey\u2019re still a team, but they\u2019re not going to play any games for the foreseeable future. That\u2019s going to leave a hole for some folks.\u201d",
      "Swift herself appeared to struggle that the end was near while performing at her 100th Eras show in June at Liverpool.",
      "\u201cThis is the very first time I\u2019ve ever acknowledged to myself and admitted that this tour is gonna end in December,\u201d she said, stressing that \u201cthis tour has really become my entire life.\u201d Late last month, in Toronto, she briefly broke down at the thought of the tour's impending end.",
      "Swift kicked off the Eras tour in Glendale, Arizona, the first of many sold-out stadiums as the tour progressed first in the U.S. and later into South America, Asia, the United Kingdom and Canada.",
      "By the end of 2023, it had become the first tour to ever gross over $1 billion and saw hundreds of millions of dollars spent on merchandise. She is likely to bring in over $2 billion by the time the tour wraps on Dec. 8, according to concert trade publication Pollstar.",
      "Throughout the tour, Swift was named Time Magazine\u2019s Person of the Year. Apple Music named her its artist of the year and Spotify revealed she was 2023\u2019s most streamed artist globally. She dropped a box office-topping concert film and helped send NFL viewership skyrocketing when she began dating Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Toward the end of the tour, she released a coffee table book.",
      "And if that wasn\u2019t enough, she released re-recordings of her Nashville-era 2010 record, \u201cSpeak Now \u201d and 2014's record \u201c1989,\u201d as well as released her 11th studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s perfect in these times to have somebody like Taylor to kind of give us distraction, give us inspiration, give us hope,\u201d said Ralph Jaccodine, an assistant professor at Berklee College of Music and a former concert promoter who has worked with Bruce Springsteen and others. \u201cAnd this is a woman that owning it, she\u2019s come a long way. And now she can talk about artist rights and women\u2019s rights and equality. And really, just her work ethic is relentless.\"",
      "Even the word \u201cera\u201d has become ubiquitous, with fans and casual observers using the term to explain both frivolous and transformative phases \u2014 are you in your \u201cvillain era\u201d or a \u201chealing era\u201d?",
      "\u201cI think this tour really solidified her position as a legend,\u201d said Kayla Wong, an influencer who runs the popular Swift-focused Instagram account @headfirstfearless. \u201cWhether or not you like her music, whether or not you think she\u2019s talented, the numbers really speak for themselves. The tour broke so many records and was such a global phenomenon for so long that I think she\u2019s achieved a level where it\u2019s undeniable as to how everlasting her impact is.\u201d",
      "Yet the tour did experience its own dark moments. In Brazil last year, one concertgoer \u2014 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides \u2014 passed out and later died of heat exhaustion. In July, British police charged a 17-year-old with murder over a stabbing attack during a Taylor Swift-themed summer holiday dance and yoga class that left three little girls dead. News outlets reported that Swift met with some of the survivors backstage in London.",
      "And in August, all three of Swift's concerts in Vienna were called off after officials announced arrests over an apparent plot to launch an attack on an event in the city. Tens of thousands of Swifties from around the world had traveled to Vienna for the shows.",
      "\u201cHaving our Vienna shows cancelled was devastating,\u201d Swift later wrote in a statement. \u201cThe reason for the cancellations filled me with a new sense of fear, and a tremendous amount of guilt because so many people had planned on coming to those shows.\u201d",
      "Through the hardships and celebrations, Swift's connections to her fans has only ballooned and deepened throughout the tour. After the Vienna cancellations, many fans flocked to the streets to sing Swift's songs and placed friendship bracelets \u2014 which also became an iconic feature of the shows \u2014 on a nearby tree.",
      "Over the past two years, the fandom has welcomed new audiences \u2014 both old and new.",
      "\u201cI feel like years ago, we were kind of all the same age and fans for the same reason,\u201d Wong said of Swifties. \u201cNow the fandom has people from all kinds of backgrounds, all ages, all different reasons for following her in the first place.\u201d"

      "Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta says it will build a $10 billion artificial intelligence data center in northeast Louisiana",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The largest artificial intelligence data center ever built by Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta is coming to northeast Louisiana, the company said Wednesday, bringing hopes that the $10 billion facility will transform an economically neglected corner of the state.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry called it \u201cgame-changing\u201d for his state's expanding tech sector, yet some environmental groups have raised concerns over the center's reliance on fossil fuels \u2014 and whether the plans for new natural gas power to support it could lead to higher energy bills in the future for Louisiana residents.",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is expanding its existing supercomputer project in Memphis, Tennessee, the city's chamber of commerce said Wednesday. The chamber also said that Nvidia, Dell, and Supermicro Computer will be \u201cestablishing operations in Memphis,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "Louisiana is among a growing number of states offering tax credits and other incentives to lure big tech firms seeking sites for energy-intensive data centers.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department found that there aren\u2019t enough data centers in the U.S. to meet the rising AI-fueled demand, which is projected to grow by 9% each year through 2030, citing industry reports.",
      "Meta anticipates its Louisiana data center will create 500 operational jobs and 5,000 temporary construction jobs, said Kevin Janda, director of data center strategy. At 4 million square feet (370,000 square meters), it will be the company's largest AI data center to date, he added.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we are having a positive impact on the local level,\u201d Janda said.",
      "Congressional leaders and local representatives from across the political spectrum heralded the Meta facility as a boon for Richland parish, a rural part of Louisiana with a population of 20,000 historically reliant on agriculture. About one in four residents are considered to live in poverty and the parish has an employment rate below 50%, according to the U.S. census data.",
      "Meta plans to invest $200 million into road and water infrastructure improvements for the parish to offset its water usage. The facility is expected to be completed in 2030.",
      "Entergy, one of the nation's largest utility providers, is fast-tracking plans to build three natural gas power plants in Louisiana capable of generating 2,262 megawatts for Meta's data center over a 15-year period \u2014 nearly one-tenth of Entergy's existing energy capacity across four states.",
      "The Louisiana Public Service Commission is weighing Entergy's proposal as some environmental groups have opposed locking the state into more fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Meta said it plans to help bring 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy onto the grid in the future.",
      "Louisiana residents may ultimately end up with rate increases to pay off the cost of operating these natural gas power plants when Meta's contract with Entergy expires, said Jessica Hendricks, state policy director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana-based nonprofit advocating for energy consumers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why residential customers in Louisiana need to pay for a power plant for energy that they\u2019re not going to use,\" Hendricks said. \"And we want to make sure that there\u2019s safeguards in place.\u201d",
      "Public service commissioner Foster Campbell, representing northeast Louisiana, said he does not believe the data center will increase rates for Louisiana residents and views it as vital for his region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going in one of the most needed places in Louisiana and maybe one of the most needed places in the United States of America,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI\u2019m for it 100%.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have also warned of the pollution generated by Musk's AI data center in Memphis. The Southern Environmental Law Center, among others, says the supercomputer could strain the power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency. Eighteen gas turbines currently running at xAI\u2019s south Memphis facility are significant sources of ground-level ozone, better known as smog, the group said.",
      "Patrick Anderson, an attorney at the law center, said xAI has operated with \u201ca stunning lack of transparency\u201d in developing its South Memphis facility, which is located near predominantly Black neighborhoods that have long dealt with pollution and health risks from factories and other industrial sites.",
      "\u201cMemphians deserve to know how xAI will affect them,\u201d he said, \u201cand should have a seat at the table when these decisions are being made.\u201d",

      "ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Richard Andre Newman thought he would live the rest of his life in his quiet, leafy neighborhood in suburban Virginia. He was born and raised in Bren Mar Park, where children ride their bikes and neighbors wave hello.",
      "But now, as he\u2019s approaching 60, he\u2019s considering selling his Fairfax County home and moving away. That\u2019s because he\u2019s getting a new neighbor: Plaza 500, a 466,000-square-foot data center and an adjacent electrical substation to be built a few hundred feet from townhomes, playgrounds and a community center.",
      "Newman feels helpless to stop it.",

      "The sprawling, windowless warehouses that hold rows of high-speed servers powering almost everything the world does on phones and computers are increasingly becoming fixtures of the American landscape, popping up in towns, cities and suburbs across the United States.",
      "Demand for data centers ballooned in recent years due to the rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence, and local governments are competing for lucrative deals with big tech companies. But as data centers begin to move into more densely populated areas, abutting homes and schools, parks and recreation centers, some residents are pushing back against the world\u2019s most powerful corporations over concerns about the economic, social and environmental health of their communities.",
      "Tyler Ray, a vocal critic of data centers and leader in the fight against the Virginia project, said the incentives offered are not enough to counteract the consequences of building a facility so close to homes.",
      "\u201cAll that we are asking for is, as the county is trying to bring in this data center income, that they are doing it in a way that doesn\u2019t run residents away from their homes,\u201d he said.",
      "In Northern Virginia, more than 300 data centers dot the rolling hills of the area\u2019s westernmost counties. Cyclists who ride the popular Washington & Old Dominion trail are at times flanked by data centers, and the thousands of commuters who head into the nation\u2019s capital each day can see them in the distance from the Metro.",
      "Plaza 500, one of the latest proposals in the area, is encroaching on neighborhoods like never before, said Newman, who heads a homeowners association in the community.",
      "The pitch from Starwood Capital Group, the private investment firm founded by billionaire Barry Sternlicht, to Fairfax County officials promised a significant property tax boost and, in addition to permanent positions in the data center itself, hundreds of temporary construction and electrical jobs to build the facility.",
      "Tyler Ray and his husband moved to the Bren Pointe community in 2022, hoping to balance proximity to Washington with a desire for green space.",
      "But shortly after the couple moved in, Starwood Capital began scoping out a commercial property near their new home as a possible location for the Plaza 500 project.",
      "When Ray and his neighbors learned of the proposal, they held protests, attended regular county meetings and drew media attention to their concerns to try and stop the development. But their efforts were largely unsuccessful: the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in September said all newly proposed data centers must adhere to stricter zoning rules, but the Plaza 500 project would be grandfathered in under the old rules.",
      "Ray worries that more data centers in the area could compromise the already stressed power grid: Over 25% of all power produced in Virginia in 2023 went to data centers, a figure that could rise as high as 46% by 2030 if data center growth continues at its current pace. Some estimates also show a mid-sized data center commands the same water usage every day as 1,000 households, prompting concerns over the cost of water. Ray also frets over air quality, as the massive diesel generators that help power the data centers\u2019 hardware send plumes of toxic pollutants into the atmosphere.",
      "A spokesman for the firm declined to respond to questions for this story.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how a general resident, even someone who has been engaging intently on an issue,\u201d Ray said, \u201chas any chance to go up against the data center industry.\u201d",
      "For local governments, attracting data centers to their municipalities means a financial boon: Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in 2024 that Virginia\u2019s existing data centers brought in $1 billion in tax revenue, more than the $750 million in tax breaks given to the tech companies that own them in 2023.",
      "For average-sized facilities, data centers offer a small number of direct jobs \u2014 often fewer than 100 positions. Google announced recently that its two data centers in Loudoun County, which has about 440,000 residents, created only around 150 direct jobs. But data center advocates argue that the number of indirect jobs like construction, technology support and electrical work make the projects worthwhile. In that same announcement, Google said their investment spurred 2,730 indirect jobs.",
      "Kathy Smith, the vice chair of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors, voted in favor of the Plaza 500 proposal because, in her estimation, data center growth is inevitable in the region, and Fairfax County should reap the benefits.",
      "\u201cI have a responsibility to step back from what we do and look at the big picture,\u201d Smith said. \u201cData centers are not going away.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, in Morrow County, Oregon, Amazon Web Services has built at least five data centers surrounding the 4,200-person town of Boardman, nestled among vast stretches of farmland flecked with mint patches and wind turbines, next to the Columbia river.",
      "Last year, AWS, which is owned by Amazon, paid roughly $34 million in property taxes and fees stipulated in the agreements after receiving a $66 million tax break. The company also paid out $10 million total in two, one-time payments to a community development fund and spent another $1.7 million in charitable donations in the community in 2023.",
      "That money has been instrumental in updating infrastructure and bolstering services for the roughly 12,000-person county, going toward a new ladder fire engine, a school resource officer, police body cameras, and $5,000 grants for homebuyers among other things.",
      "Still, some residents are skeptical of the scale of tax break deals. Suspicions started years ago, when three formerly elected officials allegedly helped approve data center deals while owning a stake in a company that contracted with AWS to provide fiber optic cables for the data centers. In June, they each paid $2,000 to settle an ethics complaint against them.",
      "Those officials are no longer in office. But some remain wary of the relationships between the company and local officials, and raised eyebrows at one of the latest data center deals which gives AWS an estimated $1 billion in tax breaks spread over the 15 years to build five new data centers.",
      "Former county commissioner Jim Doherty described a meeting with AWS officials soon after he was elected to office at an upscale restaurant in Boardman, where large windows opened onto the Columbia River.",
      "The AWS representatives asked what Doherty wanted to accomplish as a commissioner. \u201cThey said, \u2018Tell us what your dreams are. Tell us what you need. Tell us what we can do for you,\u2019\u201d Doherty recalled. Other former officials have described similar interactions. Doherty said AWS didn\u2019t ask for anything in return, but the exchange left him uneasy.",
      "\u201cWe engage with stakeholders in every community where we operate around the world, and part of that outreach is to better understand a community\u2019s goals,\u201d said Kevin Miller, AWS' Vice President of global data centers. \u201cThis helps AWS be a catalyst for communities to achieve those goals, and reflects our ongoing commitment to being good neighbors.\u201d",
      "Doherty and another former county commissioner Melissa Lindsay said they pushed unsuccessfully in 2022 for AWS to pay more in taxes in new data center negotiations. They also lobbied to hire outside counsel to negotiate on their behalf, feeling outgunned by the phalanx of AWS-suited lawyers.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t want to blow it up. We didn\u2019t want to run them off,\" said Lindsay. \u201cBut there were better deals to be made.\u201d",
      "Boardman Mayor Paul Keefer and Police Chief Rick Stokoe say their direct line to AWS allows them to get the most out of the company.",
      "\u201cThis road right here? Wouldn\u2019t happen if it wasn\u2019t for AWS,\u201d said Keefer, riding in the passenger seat of Stokoe\u2019s cruiser, pointing out the window at construction workers shifting dirt and laying pavement. Both Keefer and Stokoe have been in positions to vote on whether to authorize tax breaks for AWS.",
      "\u201cThese companies would not be here if they weren\u2019t getting some kind of incentive,\u201d Stokoe said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t be any money to talk about.\u201d",

      "A top White House official says at least eight U.S. telecom firms and dozens of nations have been impacted by a Chinese hacking campaign",
      "WASHINGTON -- A top White House official on Wednesday said at least eight U.S. telecom firms and dozens of nations have been impacted by a Chinese hacking campaign.",
      "Deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger offered new details about the breadth of the sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "Neuberger divulged the scope of the hack a day after the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued guidance intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. White House officials cautioned that the number of telecommunication firms and countries impacted could still grow.",
      "The U.S. believes that the hackers were able to gain access to communications of senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures through the hack, Neuberger said.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t believe any classified communications has been compromised,\u201d Neuberger added during a call with reporters.",
      "She noted that because the hack appeared to be targeting a relatively small group of individuals, only a small number of Americans' phone calls and texts have been compromised. Neuberger added that impacted companies are all responding, but none \u201chave fully removed the Chinese actors from these networks.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo there is a risk of ongoing compromises to communications until U.S. companies address the cybersecurity gaps the Chinese are likely to maintain their access,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "She said that President Joe Biden has been briefed on the findings and that the White House \u201chas made it a priority for the federal government to do everything it can to get to the bottom this.\u201d",
      "The Chinese embassy in Washington on Tuesday rejected the accusations that it was responsible for the hack after the U.S. federal authorities issued new guidance.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China,\u201d embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said.",
      "The embassy did not immediately respond to messages on Wednesday.",
      "White House officials believe that the hacking was regionally targeted and the focus was on very senior government officials.",
      "Federal authorities confirmed in October that hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The number of countries impacted by the hack is currently believed to be in the \u201clow, couple dozen,\u201d according to a senior administration official.",
      "The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said they believed the hacks started at least a year or two ago.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions.",
      "If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the operation, which has been dubbed Salt Typhoon, and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, experts say.",
      "Neuberger pointed to efforts that have been made to beef up cybersecurity in the rail, aviation, energy and other sectors following the May 2021 ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline.",
      "\u201cSo, to prevent ongoing Salt typhoon type intrusions by China, we believe we need to apply a similar minimum cybersecurity practice,\u201d Neuberger said.",
      "The cyberattack by a gang of criminal hackers on the critical U.S. pipeline, which delivers about 45% of the fuel used along the Eastern Seaboard, sent ripple effects across the economy, highlighting cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s aging energy infrastructure. Colonial confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems as it scrambled to get the nation's fuel pipeline back online.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A tech billionaire who bought a series of spaceflights from Elon Musk's SpaceX and conducted the first private spacewalk was nominated by President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to lead NASA.",
      "Jared Isaacman, 41, CEO and founder of a credit card-processing company, has been a close collaborator with Musk ever since buying his first chartered flight with SpaceX. He took along contest winners on that 2021 trip and followed it in September with a flight where he briefly popped out the hatch to test SpaceX's new spacewalking suits.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman will replace Bill Nelson, 82, a former Democratic senator from Florida who was nominated by President Joe Biden. Nelson flew aboard space shuttle Columbia in 1986 \u2013 on the flight right before the Challenger disaster \u2014 while a congressman.",
      "Isaacman said he was honored to be nominated and would be \u201cgrateful to serve.\u201d \u201cHaving been fortunate to see our amazing planet from space, I am passionate about America leading the most incredible adventure in human history,\u201d he said via X.",
      "During Nelson\u2019s tenure, NASA picked up steam in its effort to return astronauts to the moon. This next-generation Apollo program \u2014 named after Apollo\u2019s mythological twin sister Artemis \u2014 plans to send four astronauts around the moon as soon as next year. The first moon landing in more than half a century would follow.",
      "NASA is counting on SpaceX to get astronauts to the lunar surface via Starship, the mega rocket launching out of Texas on test flights.",
      "The space agency already relies on SpaceX to fly astronauts to and from the International Space Station along with supply runs. Boeing launched its first crew for NASA in June, but the Starliner capsule encountered so many problems that the two test pilots ended up stuck at the space station. They\u2019ll catch a ride home with SpaceX in February, after more than eight months in orbit. Their mission should have lasted eight days.",
      "Also on NASA's plate right now: exploring the solar system. Robotic missions to the moon and beyond continues with a NASA spacecraft en route to Jupiter\u2019s watery moon Europa and the Mars rover Perseverance collecting more rock and dirt samples.",
      "Facing tight budgets, NASA is seeking a quicker, cheaper way of getting these Martian samples to Earth than the original plan, which had swollen to $11 billion with nothing arriving before 2040. As with human spaceflight, NASA has turned to industry and others for ideas and help.",
      "Musk congratulated Isaacman via X, describing him as a man of \u201chigh ability and integrity.\u201d",
      "The fighter jet-piloting Isaacman, whose call name is Rook, short for rookie, has described himself as a \u201cspace geek\u201d since kindergarten.

    "summary": "The District of Columbia is alleging in a lawsuit that Amazon secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods in the city",
    "story": [
      "The District of Columbia is alleging in a lawsuit that Amazon secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods in the city",
      "The District of Columbia sued Amazon on Wednesday, alleging the company secretly stopped providing its fastest delivery service to residents of two predominantly Black neighborhoods while still charging millions of dollars for a membership that promises the benefit.",
      "The complaint filed in District of Columbia Superior Court revolves around Amazon\u2019s Prime membership, which costs consumers $139 per year or $14.99 per month for fast deliveries \u2014 including one-day, two-day and same-day shipments \u2014 along with other enhancements.",
      "In mid-2022, the lawsuit alleges, the Seattle-based online retailer imposed what it called a delivery \u201cexclusion\u201d on two low-income ZIP codes in the district \u2014 20019 and 20020 \u2014 and began relying exclusively on third-party delivery services such as UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, rather than its own delivery systems.",
      "Amazon says it made the change based on concerns about driver safety.",
      "\u201cThere have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages\u201d in the two ZIP codes and the company made the change to \u201cput the safety of delivery drivers first,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a prepared statement.",
      "\u201cWe made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers,\u201d Nantel said. \u201cThe claims made by the attorney general, that our business practices are somehow discriminatory or deceptive, are categorically false.\u201d",
      "The District of Columbia's attorney general\u2019s office alleged the company never told Prime members in the two ZIP codes about the change even though they experienced slower deliveries as a result. Amazon also did not tell new customers about the exclusions when they signed up for Prime memberships, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cAmazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide,\u201d District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb said in a statement, referencing the two areas in the city where Amazon is accused of excluding its speediest deliveries.",
      "\u201cWhile Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" Schwalb said.",
      "The lawsuit says Amazon has nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the two ZIP codes, a number that represents nearly half of the population. Prime members in those neighborhoods have ordered more than 4.5 million packages in the past four years, and are more likely to rely on Amazon since they have fewer services and retail stores nearby, the city said. The area is also a notorious food desert.",
      "The district says that in 2021, before Amazon implemented its delivery \u201cexclusion,\u201d more than 72% of Prime packages in the impacted ZIP codes were delivered within two days. But last year, it was only 24%, according to the complaint.",
      "Meanwhile, the district's lawsuit says Prime members who lived in other parts of the city received two-day deliveries 75% of the time. Amazon was also improving its delivery speeds nationwide.",
      "When some customers in the city complained about the slower deliveries, Amazon concealed the true reason for the delays and \u201cdeceptively implied\" that the delays \"were simply due to natural fluctuations in shipping circumstances, rather than an affirmative decision by Amazon,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "District officials are asking the court to issue an order prohibiting Amazon from \u201cengaging in unfair or deceptive practices.\u201d They also want the company to pay restitution or damages to affected Prime members, as well as civil penalties.",
      "This isn't the first time Amazon has been accused of offering slower deliveries to some places where Black people make up most of the households.",
      "In 2016, American news outlet Bloomberg published an investigation that said Black residents of cities like Atlanta and Chicago were about half as likely as white residents to live in neighborhoods with access to Amazon's same-day delivery service.",
      "Local news website DCist reported a year later that Amazon's restaurant delivery service - which the company shut down five years ago - had excluded some neighborhoods in Washington, including one of the ZIP codes mentioned in the district's lawsuit.",
      "Nantel said Amazon is \u201calways transparent\u201d with its customers \u201cduring the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive.\u201d",
      "Since 2022, nearly 1.5 million Prime-eligible products were delivered in two days or less to Prime customers residing in the two ZIP codes, the company said.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019d like to do, and have offered, is to work together with the attorney general and their office in an effort to reduce crime and improve safety in these areas,\u201d Nantel aid. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the safety of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed Wednesday represents the second major legal battle between Amazon and the District of Columbia which also filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company."

      "China has announced a ban on exports to the United States of gallium, germanium and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications",
      "BANGKOK -- China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after the Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications.",
      "The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology.",
      "China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof.",
      "\u201cChina has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China\u2019s technological progress,\" Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday.",
      "\"I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,\u201d Lin said.",
      "China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite.",
      "Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report.",
      "The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials.",
      "China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology.",

      "Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security.",
      "China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China\u2019s fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology.",
      "Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology.",
      "The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, \u201cabuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies.",

      "The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources.",

      "U.S. officials are urging telecommunication companies to boost network security following a Chinese hacking operation that gave officials in Beijing access to the private texts and phone conversations of Americans",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal authorities on Tuesday urged telecommunication companies to boost network security following a sprawling Chinese hacking campaign that gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans.",
      "The guidance issued by the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is intended to help root out the hackers and prevent similar cyberespionage in the future. Officials who briefed reporters on the recommendations said the U.S. still doesn't know the true scope of China's attack or the extent to which Chinese hackers still have access to U.S. networks.",
      "In one sign of the global reach of China's hacking efforts, the government's warning was issued jointly with security agencies in New Zealand, Australia and Canada, members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, which also includes the U.S. and Britain.",
      "Dubbed Salt Typhoon by analysts, the wide-ranging cyberespionage campaign emerged earlier this year after hackers sought to penetrate the networks of multiple telecommunications companies.",
      "The hackers used their access to telecom networks to target the metadata of a large number of customers, including information on the dates, times and recipients of calls and texts.",
      "The hackers succeeded in retrieving the actual audio files of calls and content from texts from a much smaller number of victims. The FBI has contacted victims in this group, many of whom work in government or politics, but officials said it is up to telecom companies to notify customers included in the first, larger group.",
      "Despite months of investigation, the true scale of China\u2019s operation, including the total number of victims or whether the hackers still have some access to information, is currently unknown.",
      "The FBI has said some of the information targeted by the hackers relates to U.S. law enforcement investigations and court orders, suggesting the hackers may have been trying to access programs subject to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA. The law grants American spy agencies sweeping powers to surveil the communications of people suspected of being agents of a foreign power.",
      "But on Tuesday, officials said they think the hackers were more broadly motivated, hoping to burrow deeply into the nation's telecommunications systems to gain wide access to Americans' information.",
      "The suggestions for telecom companies released Tuesday are largely technical in nature, urging encryption, centralization and consistent monitoring to deter cyber intrusions. If implemented, the security precautions could help disrupt the Salt Typhoon operation and make it harder for China or any other nation to mount a similar attack in the future, said Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity and one of the officials who briefed reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any illusion that once we kick off these actors they\u2019re not going to come back,\u201d Greene said.",
      "Several recent high-profile hacking incidents have been linked to China and what officials say is Beijing's effort to steal technical and government secrets while also gaining access to critical infrastructure such as the electrical grid.",
      "In September, the FBI announced that it had disrupted a vast Chinese hacking operation that involved the installation of malicious software on more than 200,000 consumer devices, including cameras, video recorders and home and office routers. The devices were then used to create a massive network of infected computers, or botnet, that could then be used to carry out other cyber crimes.",
      "In October, officials said hackers linked to China targeted the phones of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, along with people associated with Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "China has rejected accusations from U.S. officials that it engages in cyberespionage directed against Americans.",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington called the U.S. allegations \u201cdisinformation.\"",
      "China's government \u201cfirmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,\u201d spokesperson Liu Pengyu wrote in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \u201cThe US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.\u201d"

      "Tired of thinking about what gifts to get everyone this year? Artificial intelligence chatbots might help, but don't expect them to do all the work or always give you the right answers.",
      "Anyone scouring the internet for Cyber Monday deals is likely going to encounter more conversational iterations of the chatbots that some retailers and e-commerce sites have built to provide shoppers with enhanced customer service.",
      "Some companies have integrated models infused with newer generative AI technologies, allowing shoppers to seek advice by asking naturally phrased questions like \u201cWhat's the best wireless speaker?\u201d",
      "Retailers hope consumers use these chatbots, which are typically called shopping assistants - as virtual companions that help them discover or compare products. Prior chatbots were mostly used for task-oriented functions such as helping customers track down online orders or return ones that didn't meet expectations.",
      "Amazon, the king of online retail, has said its customers have been questioning Rufus - the generative AI- powered shopping assistant it launched this year - for information such as whether a specific coffee maker is easy to clean, or what recommendations it has for a lawn game for a child's birthday party.",
      "And Rufus, which is available for holiday shoppers in the U.S. and some other countries, is not the only shopping assistant out there. A select number of Walmart shoppers will have access this year to a similar chatbot the nation's largest retailer is testing in a few product categories, including toys and electronics.",
      "Perplexity AI added something new to the AI chat-shopping world last month by rolling out a feature on its AI-powered search engine that enables users to ask a question like \u201cWhat's the best women's leather boots?\" and then receive specific product results that the San Francisco-based company says are not sponsored.",
      "\u201cIt has been adopted at pretty incredible scale,\u201d Mike Mallazzo, an analyst and writer at retail research media company Future Commerce, said.",
      "Retailers with websites and e-commerce companies started paying more attention to chatbots when use of ChatGPT, an artificial intelligence text chatbot made by the company OpenAI, went mainstream in late 2022, sparking public and business interest in the generative AI technology that powers the tool.",
      "Victoria\u2019s Secret, IKEA, Instacart and the Canadian retailer Ssense are among other companies experimenting with chatbots, some of which use technology from OpenAI.",
      "Even before the improved chatbots, online retailers were creating product recommendations based on a customer's prior purchases or search history. Amazon was at the forefront of having recommendations on its platform, so Rufus' ability to provide some is not particularly groundbreaking.",
      "But Rajiv Mehta, the vice president of search and conversational shopping at Amazon, said the company is able to offer more helpful recommendations now by programming Rufus to ask clarifying or follow-up questions. Customers are also using Rufus to look for deals, some of which are personalized, Mehta said.",
      "To be sure, chatbots are prone to hallucinations, so Rufus and most of the tools like it can get things wrong.",
      "Juozas Kaziukenas, founder of e-commerce intelligence firm Marketplace Pulse, wrote in a November blog post that his firm tested Rufus by requesting gaming TV recommendations. The chatbot's response included products that were not TVs. When asked for the least expensive options, Rufus came back with suggestions that weren't the cheapest, Kaziukenas said.",
      "An Associated Press reporter recently asked Rufus to give some gift recommendations for a brother. The chatbot quickly spit out a few ideas for \u201cthoughtful gifts,\" ranging from a T-shirt and a keychain with charms to a bolder suggestion: a multifunctional knife engraved with the phrase \u201cBEST BROTHER EVER.\u201d",
      "After a 5-minute written conversation, Rufus offered more tailored suggestions - a few Barcelona soccer jerseys sold by third-party sellers. But it wasn\u2019t able to say which seller offered the lowest price. When asked during another search for a price comparison on a popular skin serum, Rufus showed the product's pre-discounted price instead of its present one.",
      "\u201cRufus is constantly learning,\u201d Amazon's Mehta said during an interview.",
      "Shop AI, a chatbot that Canadian e-commerce company Shopify launched last year, can also help shoppers discover new products by asking its own questions, such as soliciting details about an intended gift recipient or features the buyer wants to avoid. Shop AI has trouble, however, recommending specific products or identifying the lowest-priced item in a product category.",
      "The limitations show the technology is still in its infancy and has a long way to go before it becomes as useful as the retail industry - and many shoppers - wish it could be.",
      "To truly transform the shopping experience, shopping assistants will \u201cneed to be deeply personalized\u201d and be able - on their own - to remember a customer\u2019s order history, product preferences and purchasing habits, consulting giant McKinsey & Company said in an August report.",
      "Amazon has noted that Rufus' answers are based on information contained in product listings, community Q&As and customer reviews, which would include the fake reviews that are used to boost or diminish sales for products on its marketplace.",
      "The large language model that powers the chatbot was also trained on the company's entire catalog and some public information on the web, Trishul Chilimbi, an Amazon vice president who oversees AI research, wrote in the electrical engineering magazine IEEE Spectrum in October.",
      "But its unclear how Amazon and other companies are weighting different training components - such as reviews - in their recommendations, or how exactly the shopping assistants come up with them, according to Nicole Greene, an analyst at management consulting firm Gartner.",
      "Perplexity AI's new shopping feature allows users to enter search queries such as \u201cbest phone case\" and to receive answers derived from various sources, including Amazon and other retailers, such as Best Buy. Perplexity also invited retailers to share data about their products and said those that do would have an increased chance of having their items recommended to shoppers.",
      "But Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas, suggested in a recent interview with Fortune magazine that he didn't know how the new shopping feature recommended products to customers. But in an interview with the AP, Chief Business Officer Dmitry Shevelenko pushed back on that characterization, saying Srinivas' comment \u201cwas probably taken out of context.\u201d",
      "The context, he said, is that with generative AI technology \u201cYou can\u2019t know in advance exactly what the output will be just based off of knowing what the inputs\u201d are from the training materials.",
      "Shevelenko said retailers and brands need to know they can't have their products recommended in Perplexity's search engine because they're \u201cjamming key words\u201d into their websites or using different techniques to show up better on search results",
      "\u201cThe way you show up in an answer is by having a better product and better features,\u201d he said.",

But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace.",

      "Many economist have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles.",
      "The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% \u2014 compared to 3.9% in 2023.",
      "A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won\u2019t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers.",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d \u2014 and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined.",
      "U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1\u202fbillion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. And on Saturday and Sunday, shoppers spent another $10.9 billion online, up 5.8% over last year.",
      "Adobe reported Monday that as of 6:30 p.m. ET, shoppers had spent $8.7 billion\u202fon the online shopping holiday.

      "Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double digits, while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%.",

      "But she said the truncated season \u2014 there are five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day \u2014 is making it harder for her retail customers to forecast.",
      "In fact, Carere said only four of FedEx\u2019s top 20 holiday e-commerce customers got their shipping predictions correct for the week before the Thanksgiving weekend. And she also noted that while FedEx predicts low single-digit percentage growth in shipping volume each day, she thinks that many retail customers will see a decline for the overall holiday period because of the truncated season.",

      "As temperatures drop into the teens, Minnesotans have embraced sauna culture for warmth and community",
      "EAGAN, Minn. -- As another frigid winter settles over Minnesota with temperatures dipping into the teens, people like Ed Kranz are embracing the cold \u2014 and working up quite a sweat.",
      "Kranz and his wife, Colleen, are among Minnesotans who believe the best way to endure winter is to heat up in saunas and then cool off in their state's icy weather.",
      "On a bone-chilling Sunday morning, they set up a mobile wood-fired sauna from their business, Saunable, near a frozen lake in the Minneapolis suburb of Eagan. After about 10 minutes of sweating in the 185 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius) sauna they moseyed outside into the 15-degree temperatures, lingering around a fire in bathing suits before repeating the process three or four more times. One brave soul dipped into a hole in the frozen lake for a post-sauna cold plunge.",
      "Their hot-and-cold venture is common in Minnesota, where plenty of residents embrace sauna culture for warmth and community. Devotees say they are mingling Old World traditions with newfangled internet-based communities, and making social connections in a society that can feel isolating.",
      "Sauna and cold plunges go together like peanut butter and jelly, said Glenn Auerbach, a self-described sauna evangelist and the founder and editor of SaunaTimes. Auerbach started the website in 2008 to share his thoughts, research and conversations with movers and shakers in the sauna world. He and his interlocutors mull over the nitty-gritty of sauna construction, how to cultivate \u201cgood sauna vibes\u201d and the potential health benefits of the sauna lifestyle.",
      "A typical temperature to achieve the holy trinity of the sauna experience \u2014 heat, steam and ventilation \u2014 is about 180 to 200 degrees F (82-93 degrees C), a temperature that starkly contrasts Minnesota's frigid winter weather.",
      "The craftiest in the sauna community can build a facility for about $10,000, according to Auerbach. Those looking to skip the physical labor can outsource the construction. Sauna's popularity, which enthusiasts say spiked following the COVID-19 pandemic, has brought with it a rise in manufacturers selling saunas for about $30,000 to $40,000.",
      "While sauna's cultural cache may have increased in recent years, the practice long predates the Instagrammable spaces now popping up, Auerbach said.",
      "The smell of cedar wood has been lodged in Justin Juntunen's memory ever since he first stepped into his family's sauna as a child. Juntunen, the founder of Cedar and Stone Nordic Sauna, is a descendant of Finnish immigrants who came to America in the 1880s. They brought with them an appreciation for saunas and the communal values the steam-filled rooms impart to local life.",
      "People in Finland say there are more saunas than cars, Juntunen said. When immigrants like his grandfather came to Minnesota to work in the mines, mills or docks, they would often save up to build a farmhouse. But they would build a sauna first, living in the space while the house was constructed. Later, saunas would serve as informal town centers.",
      "People gossiped in saunas, they gave birth in saunas and they died in saunas, Juntunen said. The public nature of the facilities reflects the egalitarian ethos that infuses Nordic culture, and sauna culture by extension, he added.",
      "\u201cThis is a tradition that\u2019s actually for everyone,\u201d Juntunen said. \u201cMy favorite Nordic proverb is all people are created equal, but nowhere more so than in the sauna.\"",
      "In addition to a desire for in-person experiences following the COVID-19 pandemic, sauna enthusiasts say interest rose after some of the internet\u2019s most famous figures, such as podcasters Joe Rogan and Andrew Huberman, touted it.",
      "\u201cEvery big podcaster in the world discovered that you could jump in cold water and it feels kind of good. And then people click on it online,\u201d Juntunen said.",
      "In this way, technology has been a paradox for sauna culture, he added. Digital media helped sauna culture grow at the same time as saunas were billed as reprieves from the pervasive reach of technology over every facet of daily life.",
      "Either way, almost all of sauna culture's adherents say its rise is inextricably linked to a desire for community.",
      "Those who committed to building their own saunas have hosted friends, neighbors, and former high school hockey teammates over. This has created a new form of post-COVID-19 contagiousness: \u201cGood heat is contagious,\u201d Auerbach said.",
      "This core function of sauna culture spans generations. Juntunen's grandfather would rush to the sauna after work because it was the space where stories were told.",
      "\"It\u2019s a space where storytelling happens, where connection happens or silence happens,\" Juntunen said. \u201cI think that is a really beautiful example of what a sauna truly is.\u201d"

      "Alexander Mashinsky, 58, of Manhattan, entered the plea in New York federal court to commodities and securities fraud.",
      "He admitted illegally manipulating the price of Celsius\u2019s proprietary crypto token while secretly selling his own tokens at inflated prices to pocket about $48 million before Celsius collapsed into bankruptcy in 2022.",
      "In court, he admitted that in 2021 he publicly suggested there was regulatory consent for the company's moves because he knew that customers \u201cwould find false comfort\u201d with that.",
      "And he said that in 2019, he was selling the crypto tokens even though he told the public that he was not. He said he knew customers would draw false comfort from that too.",
      "\u201cI accept full responsibility for my actions,\u201d Mashinsky said of crimes that stretched from 2018 to 2022 as the company pitched itself to customers as a modern-day bank where they could safely deposit crypto assets and earn interest.",
      "U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a release that Mashinsky \u201corchestrated one of the biggest frauds in the crypto industry\u201d as his company's assets purportedly grew to about $25 billion at its peak, making it one of the largest crypto platforms in the world.",
      "He said Mashinsky used catchy slogans like \u201cUnbank Yourself\u201d to entice prospective customers with a pledge that their money would be as safe in crypto accounts as money would be in a bank. Meanwhile, prosecutors said, Mashinsky and co-conspirators used customer deposits to fund market purchases of the Celsius token to prop up its value.",
      "Machinsky made tens of millions of dollars selling his own CEL tokens at artificially high prices, leaving his customers \u201cholding the bag when the company went bankrupt,\u201d Williams said.",
      "An indictment alleged that Mashinsky promoted Celsius through media interviews, his social media accounts and Celsius\u2019 website, along with a weekly \u201cAsk Mashinsky Anything\u201d session broadcast that was posted to Celsius\u2019 website and a YouTube channel.",
      "Celsius employees from multiple departments who noticed false and misleading statements in the sessions warned Mashinsky, but they were ignored, the indictment said.",
      "A plea agreement Mashinsky made with prosecutors calls for him to be sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and to forfeit over $48 million, which is the amount of money he allegedly made by selling his company's token.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 8."

      "Both networks targeted Romanian users. One had only 1,781 followers and supported Georgescu, who was a little-known independent candidate until he set off shockwaves by convincingly winning the first round of voting, beating out the incumbent prime minister. The other networks supported different candidates, Pegum said.",

      "He gained huge traction and popularity in the weeks leading up to the first vote. But experts suspect Georgescu\u2019s online following was artificially inflated while officials hinted that he was given preferential treatment by TikTok.",

      "Super Micro has been among tech companies recently riding a the artificial intelligence wave. In August, Super Micro reported fourth-quarter revenue of $5.31 billion, a more than 143% increase over the $2.18 billion it reported in the same quarter of 2023."

      "BANGKOK -- The U.S. Commerce Department has expanded the list of Chinese technology companies subject to export controls to include many that make equipment used to make computer chips, chipmaking tools and software.",
      "The 140 companies newly included in the so-called \u201centity list\u201d are nearly all based in China. But some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore.",
      "The revised rules were posted Monday on the website of the U.S. Federal Register for publication later this week. They also limit exports of high-bandwidth memory chips to China. Such chips are needed to process massive amounts of data in advanced applications such as artificial intelligence.",

      "\u201cThis is a typical act of economic coercion and non-market practice,\u201d the ministry said in a statement.",
      "Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the move was intended to impair China's ability to use advanced technologies that \u201cpose a risk to our national security.\u201d",
      "The addition of the companies to the \u201centity list\u201d means that export licenses will likely be denied for any U.S. company trying to do business with them.",
      "Washington has been gradually expanding the number of companies affected by such export controls, as the administration of President Joe Biden has encouraged an expansion of investments in and manufacturing of semiconductors in the U.S.",

    "summary": "Scientists and culture experts in New Zealand have begun the first-ever dissection of a spade-toothed whale, the world's rarest whale species",
    "story": [
      "Scientists and culture experts in New Zealand have begun the first-ever dissection of a spade-toothed whale, the world's rarest whale species",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- It is the world\u2019s rarest whale, with only seven of its kind ever spotted. Almost nothing is known about the enigmatic species. But on Monday a small group of scientists and cultural experts in New Zealand clustered around a near-perfectly preserved spade-toothed whale hoping to decode decades of mystery.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how extraordinary it is,\u201d said a joyful Anton van Helden, senior marine science adviser for New Zealand\u2019s conservation agency, who gave the spade-toothed whale its name to distinguish it from other beaked species. \u201cFor me personally, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d",
      "Van Helden has studied beaked whales for 35 years, but Monday was the first time he has participated in a dissection of the spade-toothed variety. In fact, the careful study of the creature -- which washed up dead on a New Zealand beach in July \u2014 is the first ever to take place.",
      "None has ever been seen alive at sea.",
      "The list of what scientists don\u2019t know about spade-toothed whales is longer than what they do know. They don\u2019t know where in the ocean the whales live, why they\u2019ve never been spotted in the wild, or what their brains look like. All beaked whales have different stomach systems and researchers don\u2019t know how the spade-toothed kind processes its food. They don\u2019t know how this one died.",
      "Over the next week, researchers studying the 5-meter (16-foot) -long male at an agricultural research center near the city of Dunedin hope to find out.",
      "\u201cThere may be parasites completely new to science that just live in this whale,\u201d said van Helden, who thrilled at the chance of learning how the species produces sound and what it eats. \u201cWho knows what we\u2019ll discover?\u201d",
      "Only six other spade-toothed whales have ever been found, but all those discovered intact were buried before DNA testing could verify their identification.",
      "New Zealand is a whale-stranding hotspot, with more than 5,000 episodes recorded since 1840, according to the Department of Conservation. The first spade-toothed whale bones were found in 1872 on New Zealand\u2019s Pitt Island. Another discovery was made at an offshore island in the 1950s, and the bones of a third were found on Chile\u2019s Robinson Crusoe Island in 1986.",
      "DNA sequencing in 2002 proved that all three specimens were of the same species \u2014 and that it was distinct from other beaked whales. But researchers studying the mammal couldn\u2019t confirm whether the species was extinct until 2010, when two whole spade-toothed whales, both dead, washed up on a New Zealand beach. But none has been studied before.",
      "On Monday, the seventh of its kind, surrounded by white-aproned scientists who were measuring and photographing, appeared relatively unblemished, giving no clue about its death. Researchers pointed out marks from cookiecutter sharks \u2014 normal, they said, and not the cause.",
      "The dissection will be quiet, methodical and slower than usual, because it is being undertaken in partnership with M\u0101ori, New Zealand's Indigenous people. To M\u0101ori, whales are a taonga -\u2013 a precious treasure -\u2013 and the creature will be treated with the reverence afforded to an ancestor.",
      "Members of the local iwi, or tribe, will be present throughout the dissection and consulted at each turn, allowing them to share traditional knowledge and observe customs, such as saying a karakia -\u2013 a prayer -\u2013 over the creature before the study begins.",
      "\u201cAccording to our beliefs and our traditions, this whale is a gift of Tangaroa, deity of the ocean,\u201d said Tumai Cassidy from the local people Te R\u016bnanga \u014ct\u0101kou. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for us to respect that gift and to honor the whale.\u201d",
      "The iwi will keep the jawbone and teeth of the whale at the end of the dissection, before its skeleton is displayed in a museum. 3D printing will be used to replicate those parts, using a CT scan taken of the whale\u2019s head this week.",
      "\u201cIt all builds a richer picture for that species but also tells us how it interacts with our oceans,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "It\u2019s thought that spade-toothed whales live in the vast Southern Pacific Ocean, home to some of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches. Beaked whales are the ocean's deepest divers for food, and the spade-toothed may rarely surface, adding to its mystery.",
      "The assembled scientists on Monday included a few who had traveled from abroad to see the whale, which was put in refrigerated storage after its discovery.",
      "\u201cWhat we are interested in is not only how these animals died, but how they lived,\u201d said Joy Reidenberg, a comparative anatomist from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York. \u201cIn discovering how they live, we are hoping to find discoveries that we can apply back to the human condition.\u201d"

      "\"People passed the suspect, but he appeared to wait for his intended target,\" Tisch said.",

      "\"The shooter then walks toward the victim and continues to shoot. It appears that the gun malfunctions, as he clears the jam and begins to fire again,\" he said.",
      "The suspect fled on foot into an alley, where a phone believed to be linked to the shooter was recovered, police sources told ABC News.",
      "He then fled on a bike and he was last seen riding into Central Park at 6:48 a.m., police said.",
      "Detectives are working to determine whether the suspect had prepositioned the bike somewhere close by, according to sources.",
      "Police believe a water bottle and candy wrapper left near the shooting scene are linked to the shooter and investigators are running tests to determine if there are any usable fingerprints or DNA, law enforcement sources told ABC News.",

      "The FBI, which has the most sophisticated technology for retrieving usable data from cellphones, is helping with the investigation, the sources said.",
      "Thompson arrived in New York on Monday. Police are interviewing Thompson's colleagues and family about any potential specific threats, Kenny said.",
      "Thompson left his hotel by himself and didn't appear to have a security detail, police said.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 23:20:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Former aides of Tulsi Gabbard, Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, say her views on Russia may have been shaped by consuming Kremlin propaganda.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. intelligence has deemed the Russian news site RT to be a propaganda outlet.",
      "Since becoming President-elect Donald Trump's choice for director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard's rosy posture toward Moscow has prompted some Democratic critics to suggest that she could be \"compromised,\" or perhaps even a \"Russian asset\" -- claims the ex-Hawaii representative and Army officer has forcefully denied.",
      "But former advisers to Gabbard suggest that her views on Russia and its polarizing leader, Vladimir Putin, have been shaped not by some covert intelligence recruitment as far as they know -- but instead by her unorthodox media consumption habits.",
      "Three former aides said Gabbard, who left the Democratic Party in 2022, regularly read and shared articles from the Russian news site RT -- formerly known as Russia Today -- which the U.S. intelligence community characterized in 2017 as \"the Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet.\"",
      "While it was not clear to those former staffers whether or when she stopped frequenting the site, one former aide said Gabbard continued to circulate articles from RT \"long after\" she was advised that the outlet was not a credible source of information.",
      "Doug London, a retired 34-year veteran intelligence officer, said Gabbard's alleged penchant to rely at least in part on outlets like RT to shape her view of the world reflects poorly on her suitability to fulfill the responsibilities of a director of national intelligence.",
      "\"That Gabbard's views mirror Russia's narrative and disinformation themes can but suggest na\u00efvet\u00e9, collusion, or politically opportunistic sycophancy to echo whatever she believes Trump wants to hear,\" London said, adding, \"none of which bodes well for the president's principal intelligence adviser responsible for enabling the [U.S. intelligence community] to inform decision-making by telling it like it is.\"",
      "Alexa Henning, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team, said in a statement to ABC News that \"this is false and nothing but a few former, conveniently anonymous, disgruntled staffers.\"",
      "\"Lt. Col. Gabbard's views on foreign policy have been shaped by her military service and multiple deployments to war zones where she's seen the cost of war and who ultimately pays the price,\" Henning said.",
      "Former congressional and campaign advisers said it was unclear to what extent Gabbard's views were shaped by what she read in RT -- and they emphasized that she would consume news from a wide range of outlets, including left-wing and right-wing blogs.",
      "But over the past decade, Gabbard's views on Russian aggression in Europe have evolved in a particularly dramatic fashion.",
      "In 2014, when Russian troops annexed Crimea, Gabbard -- then a first-term Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii -- released a statement advocating for \"meaningful American military assistance for Ukrainian forces\" and for the U.S. to invoke \"stiffer, more painful economic sanctions for Russia.\"",
      "\"The consequences of standing idly by while Russia continues to degrade the territorial integrity of Ukraine are clear,\" she wrote at the time. \"We have to act in a way that takes seriously the threat of Russian aggression against its peaceful, sovereign neighbor.\"",
      "By 2017, however, her tune had changed. In a lengthy memo to campaign staff laying out her views on foreign policy, a copy of which was obtained by ABC News, Gabbard blamed the U.S. and NATO for provoking Russian aggression and bemoaned the United States' \"hostility toward Putin.\"",
      "\"There certainly isn't any guarantee to Putin that we won't try to overthrow Russia's government,\" she wrote in the memo from May 2017, titled \"fodder for fundraising emails / social media.\"",
      "\"In fact, I'm pretty sure there are American politicians who would love to do that,\" she wrote.",
      "She also condemned the very sanctions she had previously supported, writing that, \"historically, the U.S. has always wanted Russia to be a poor country.\"",
      "\"It's a matter of respect,\" she wrote. \"The Russian people are a proud people and they don't want the U.S. and our allies trying to control them and their government.\"",
      "Gabbard's sentiment in the 2017 memo is \"basically the Russian playbook,\" said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration.",
      "\"It's dangerous,\" said Daalder. \"That strain of thinking is not unique to Tulsi Gabbard, but it is certainly not where you would think a major figure in any administration would like to be, intellectually.\"",
      "By 2022, at the outset of the latest Russia-Ukraine conflict, Gabbard suggested on X that Russia's invasion was justified by Ukraine's potential bid to join NATO, \"which would mean US/NATO forces right on Russia's border\" -- a narrative perpetuated by Russian propaganda channels, including RT, and denounced by the U.S. and NATO as \"false.\"",
      "Gabbard's messaging has at times aligned so closely with Kremlin talking points that at least one commentator on Kremlin state media has referred to her as \"Russia's girlfriend.\"",
      "The U.S. government first called out RT as a propaganda mouthpiece for the Kremlin in the wake of the 2016 presidential election, three years after Gabbard was elected to Congress.",
      "This past September, the State Department wrote that it had evidence that \"RT moved beyond being simply a media outlet and has been an entity with cyber capabilities.\" The U.S. also issued fresh sanctions against executives at RT, including its editor-in-chief, who the U.S. accused of engaging in a \"nefarious effort to covertly recruit unwitting American influencers in support of their malign influence campaign.\"",
      "The Justice Department also indicted two RT employees in September for their alleged role in what the DOJ called a scheme to pay right-wing social media influencers nearly $10 million to \u201cdisseminate content deemed favorable to the Russian government.\"",
      "In the decade since Gabbard arrived in Washington, experts say she has regularly promoted views consistent with those espoused in RT and other Russian propaganda channels.",
      "In its 2017 assessment, for example, the U.S. intelligence community wrote that RT \"has actively collaborated with WikiLeaks\" and \"routinely gives [WikiLeaks founder Julian] Assange sympathetic coverage and provides him a platform to denounce the United States.\"",
      "Gabbard has long been an outspoken supporter of Assange, arguing in a June 2024 appearance on \"Real Time with Bill Maher\" that \"[Assange's] prosecution, the charges against him, are one of the biggest attacks on freedom of the press, that we've seen, and freedom of speech.\"",
      "In Congress, Gabbard also co-sponsored a resolution calling on the federal government to \"drop all charges against Edward Snowden,\" the former contractor for the National Security Agency who supplied WikiLeaks with secret documents in order to expose what he called \"horrifying\" U.S. government surveillance capabilities.",
      "RT frequently reports glowingly on Snowden, who has for more than a decade lived under asylum in Russia.",
      "But it is Gabbard's framing of the Russian invasion of Ukraine that has most galvanized her critics in the national security sphere.",
      "In March 2022, Gabbard posted a video to Twitter -- now X -- sharing what she said were \"undeniable facts\" about U.S.-funded biolabs in the war-torn country, claiming that \"even in the best of circumstances\" they \"could easily be compromised\" -- a debunked theory regularly promoted by RT and other Kremlin propaganda channels.",
      "Experts say RT and other Russian state-controlled news agencies have frequently capitalized on Gabbard's public comments to support the biolab conspiracy theory and other disinformation, recirculating clips in which she repeats the Kremlin propaganda as evidence backing the false claims -- effectively engineering an echo-chamber to magnify their propaganda machine.",
      "Even so, Brian O'Neill, a former intelligence official who helped prepare the president's daily brief, expressed confidence that career intelligence officials can support Gabbard with \"a constant barrage of new information\" that will help shape her understanding of emerging world events.",
      "\"New appointees in such roles always bring preconceptions, but like her predecessors, she will be subject to comprehensive briefings grounded in solid evidence provided by individuals of high integrity and expertise,\" O'Neill said.",
      "\"That said,\" O'Neill cautioned, \"Trump's well-documented hostility and skepticism toward the [intelligence community] will shape the environment she steps into. If she adopts a similar posture, there's a risk she might deprioritize intelligence community input or dismiss inconvenient truths presented to her.\"",

    "summary": "Tulsi Gabbard, Trump\u2019s controversial choice for Director of National Intelligence, could face one of the most bruising Senate confirmation battles.",
    "story": [
      "Gabbard could face the most one of the most bruising confirmation battles.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s choice for director of national intelligence, could face one of the most bruising Senate confirmation battles.",
      "The 43-year-old former congresswoman and onetime Democratic presidential candidate has no intelligence experience, yet would be overseeing 18 intelligence agencies with a $100 billion budget.",
      "Gabbard has been accused by public officials for voicing an anti-American agenda that hurts American interests, including blaming the U.S. for the war in Ukraine and being sympathetic to U.S. adversaries.",
      "In 2017, Gabbard met twice with Syria\u2019s authoritarian leader Bashar al-Assad, who is accused of war crimes against his own people during the Syrian civil war, which killed hundreds of thousands. A few months after the meeting, Gabbard said she was skeptical Assad used chemical weapons, despite overwhelming evidence from the U.S. government that he did.",
      "Gabbard has parroted Russian propaganda multiple times, most notably in a 2022 post on social media, where she claimed Russia attacked Ukraine because of U.S. funded biolabs. The labs are actually public and part of an international effort to stop bioweapons and prevent outbreaks. Russian state TV has even called Gabbard \u201cour girlfriend.\u201d",
      "Gabbard is anti-war and has fiercely criticized Republican and Democratic administrations over military interventions.",
      "For years, she\u2019s fought off claims from high-profile politicians that she\u2019s a Russian asset, with Democrats warning that she\u2019s a national security risk.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. intelligence community has identified her as having troubling relationships with America\u2019s foes, and so my worry is that she couldn\u2019t pass a background check,\u201d Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth said on CNN.",
      "If Gabbard is confirmed for the DNI position, she\u2019d become one of Trump\u2019s top intelligence advisers, controlling what intelligence the president sees and determining what kind of sensitive information is declassified or not.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a powerful position,\u201d said Olivia Troye, a former Trump administration national security official. Gabbard \u201cdoesn\u2019t have any perspective of what it\u2019s like for these intelligence operations that happen across the community\u2026I wonder what it also does for the morale of the community, and I\u2019m concerned about the exodus that may happen.\u201d",
      "Troye added that if Gabbard is confirmed, America\u2019s allies may not share as much information with the U.S.",
      "\u201cForeign adversaries probably celebrate this moment. I think they have succeeded in putting someone that is sympathetic to their causes. I think that is alarming and dangerous,\u201d Troye said. \u201cI think for our European allies and others around the world\u2026they're going to guard their information and realize, okay, we can no longer be a partner with the United States when we are concerned about our own security being compromised and at risk.\u201d",
      "Gabbard was once fiercely critical of Trump\u2019s presidency, saying in 2020 that he was unfit to serve with a long \u201clist of wrongdoings and abuses of power.\u201d",
      "Gabbard served in the House for eight years as a Democrat, sitting on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and serving as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "She endorsed Bernie Sanders for president in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 after her failed presidential campaign. But the once staunch Democrat endorsed and campaigned for Trump this election cycle and told him at a rally in October that she was joining the Republican Party.",
      "Gabbard is expected to appear on Capitol Hill next week for meetings.",

    "story": [
      "Ernst has been floated as a potential replacement for defense secretary.",
      "As Pete Hegseth denies allegations of sexual misconduct in his quest to become the next defense secretary, he continues to make his rounds on Capitol Hill -- including meeting Wednesday with Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a key Republican member of the Armed Services committee and herself a survivor of sexual assault.",
      "Upon leaving the meeting, Hegseth told reporters that he and Ernst had an \"engaging and instructive conversation.\"",
      "\"I appreciate Pete Hegseth's service to our country, something we both share,\" Ernst tweeted moments after their meeting concluded. \"Today, as part of the confirmation process, we had a frank and thorough conversation.\"",
      "ABC News has previously reported Ernst to be on a growing list of candidates emerging to possibly replace Hegseth as Trump's pick to lead the Department of Defense.",
      "When asked Wednesday if there was any chance she was being considered to replace Hegseth, she merely responded, \"Mr. Hegseth is the nominee.\" She was tight-lipped over whether their meeting alleviated any concerns she might have.",
      "Ernst is the first female combat veteran in the Senate. She also has a long record of supporting legislation aimed at addressing sexual assault and harassment in the military, and has been outspoken about her own experiences with sexual assault, rape, and domestic violence.",
      "Notably, Hegseth has said that women should not serve in combat roles in the military, and he continues to face his own allegations of sexual misconduct and impropriety.",
      "Hegseth has denied the sexual assault allegations. On Wednesday, he told the Megyn Kelly show \u201cabsolutely not\u201d in regards to rape accusations, and he denied many of the claims that he mistreated women.",
      "All eyes will be on Ernst as Hegseth's confirmation process plays out. Last month, Ernst told ABC News that an FBI background check into Hegseth would be \"helpful.\"",
      "In an interview with Bloomberg News in 2019, Ernst first disclosed the details of her rape as a college student at Iowa State University, in which she tearfully retold being in a \"physically and sexually abusive\" relationship with someone who raped her.",
      "During her college years, she volunteered at a safe house for battered and abused women and children.",
      "While speaking to Bloomberg, Ernst also alleged that her ex-husband, Gail Ernst, had physically abused her in an incident in which he \"grabbed [her] by the throat\" before he \"threw [her]\" on the ground and \"pounded [her] head.\" Gail Ernst declined to comment on the allegations at the time.",
      "Ernst also claimed to have endured sexual harassment in the military, which she described to Time Magazine in 2014.",
      "\"I had comments, passes, things like that,\" Ernst said. \"These were some things where I was able to say stop and it simply stopped but there are other circumstances both for women and for men where they don't stop and they may be afraid to report it.\"",
      "\"Sexual assault has no place in our military -- or anywhere else -- and it's far past time we take more steps toward preventing and reducing these heart-wrenching crimes,\" Ernst said in a statement after introducing a bipartisan bill in 2021 to prevent military sexual assault.",
      "Ernst was a member of Iowa State University's ROTC program at 20 years old before joining the U.S. Army Reserve. She later served as a company commander of an Iowa National Guard transportation unit in Kuwait.",
      "She spent 23 years in the National Guard and Army Reserve and retired as a lieutenant colonel.",
      "Ernst has been vocal about her support for Trump, despite him also having been accused of sexual assault by multiple women -- which he has repeatedly denied. Ernst was even a contender to be his running mate in the 2016 election.",
      "\"I would encourage women to stand up and say, 'You know what, I'm not going to put up with his nonsense, but I do agree with him on this policy,'\" Ernst said in a 2016 interview with WHO. \"Sometimes we have to look beyond certain aspects of a person and figure out do we agree.\"",
      "She also told Bloomberg that it was \"outrageous to suggest that anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault should therefore be a Hillary Clinton supporter.\"",
      "Ernst became the first woman to represent Iowa in either house of Congress when she was elected to the Senate in 2014."

      "Sadow asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to direct the trial judge overseeing the case to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that local prosecutors are prohibited from interfering with a president's official duties.",
      "\"This is particularly true where, as here, there is compelling evidence of local bias and political prejudice against the President by the local prosecutor, who not only answers to a tiny segment of the American electorate but is acting in clear opposition to the will of the citizens of Georgia as reflected by the recent election results,\" Sadow argued.",
      "Trump and 18 others pleaded not guilty last year to all charges in a sweeping racketeering indictment for alleged efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia. Four defendants subsequently took plea deals in exchange for agreeing to testify against other defendants.",
      "The case has been on pause after Trump and his co-defendants launched an effort to have Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis disqualified from the case over her relationship with a fellow prosecutor. Fulton County Judge Scott McAfee declined to disqualify Willis, but the case has been paused as Trump and his co-defendants appeal the decision.",
      "An oral argument before the Georgia Court of Appeals was initially scheduled for Dec. 5, but was unexpectedly canceled last month without explanation.",
      "Sadow asked the same appeals court to direct McAfee to dismiss the indictment against Trump on the grounds that the prosecution is unconstitutional.",
      "In a similar filing, Trump on Tuesday asked that his criminal hush money case in New York be immediately dismissed because the prosecution disrupts the president-elect's transition and \"threatens the functioning of the federal government.\"",
      "A federal judge last week threw out Trump\u2019s federal election interference case after special counsel Jack Smith moved to the dismiss the case due to the Justice Department's standing policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.",
      "A federal appeals court also dropped Trump from the government\u2019s ongoing appeal of Smith's classified documents case based on the same policy.",

      "Bitcoin has climbed more than 40% since Election Day, when voters opted for a candidate viewed as friendly toward digital currency.",
      "Those gains have far outpaced the stock market. The S&P 500 has increased about 2.4% over that period, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq has jumped 2.6%.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to bolster the cryptocurrency sector and ease regulations enforced by the Biden administration. Trump also promised to establish the federal government's first National Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.",

      "Gensler announced that he plans to resign on Jan. 20, 2025, the date of Trump\u2019s inauguration.",

      "Shares of Coinbase, a top crypto trading platform, have increased more than 70% since Trump\u2019s reelection.",

      "FTX, a multibillion-dollar cryptocurrency exchange co-founded by Sam Bankman-Fried, collapsed in November 2022. The implosion set off a 17-month legal saga that resulted in the conviction of Bankman-Fried for fraud. In April, Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",

      "The former World Wrestling Entertainment co-founder and president could earn a second stint in a Trump Cabinet if confirmed to run the Department of Education next year. While McMahon has experience running a large government organization -- she led the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019 in Trump's first term -- she has not worked in education outside of stints on the board of trustees at Sacred Heart University and serving on the Connecticut state Board of Education more than a decade ago.",
      "According to Trump's Agenda47 policy platform, Trump's top education priorities include eliminating the agency that McMahon would lead and topics that she has championed, like expanding school voucher programs and restoring power to parents in schools. McMahon allies suggest the businesswoman and Trump loyalist will disrupt and reshape the federal agency that's been led by Washington bureaucrats for more than four decades.",

Scott and Jahana Hayes, D-Conn., are both opponents of Trump's longstanding pledge to dismantle the department. Hayes, the 2016 National Teacher of the Year, taught in Connecticut when McMahon was on the board of education. Hayes said she is squarely focused on defending public schools.",

      "That, along with the Republicans taking control of Congress, Hanson said, might have motivated Trump to push forward with his controversial picks.",
      "\"It does raise the question if we are holding people to different standards than we used to,\" he said. \"There has been this notion to shrug it all off, thinking, 'Everyone is corrupt. At least he's open about it.'\"",
      "Edward Queen, a faculty member at Emory University Center for Ethics, said this thinking has been linked to what he said is growing distrust in the American political system.",
      "\"One of the consequences of the decline of trust is that everyone has done 'it' therefore 'it' doesn't matter. And that's disturbing,\" he told ABC News.",
      "At the same time, Hanson said, history shows the public traditionally has been against corruption, cronyism and other questionable behavior by public officials.",
      "\"There are voters in the middle who voted for Trump that would be unhappy for a vote for these troubling nominees,\" Hanson said. \"That will come back to hurt Republicans who may have ridden on his momentum.\"",
      "Jeff Spinner-Halev, the Kenan Eminent Professor of Political Ethics at the University of North Carolina, however, told ABC News that the general public has not kept up with the ins and outs of the confirmation process on Capitol Hill, and the outcry may not be that loud.",
      "\"It will have limited influence,\" he said of the public reaction. \"What will matter if a few senators are concerned about the controversies or competency of the candidate verses how much they care about the wrath of President Trump.\"",
      "The Senate must confirm each Cabinet choice, and while the GOP will have the majority, some Senate Republicans who back Trump also question whether his picks' ethical issues make them impossible to approve, according to Hanson.",
      "\"Putting my shoes in a senator's for a moment, they don't want to walk the plank for a vote,\" Hanson added. \"If they feel that a nominee is too unpopular, they don't want to stick their hand in the air and say 'yes' -- but if they do, he said, they would need to weigh the consequences of looking the other way.\"",
      "He sees the fact that some GOP senators signaled Gaetz wasn't acceptable as proof some standards still exist. For example, Gaetz withdrew his name from the nomination eight days after Trump announced it due to the increased scrutiny and more details about his scandals came to light.",
      "Gaetz said in a social media post that his nomination process would have been \"a distraction.\"",
      "\"No one was really looking to defend this guy, and the message got sent to the president-elect's team that this isn't going to work,\" Hanson said.",
      "\"I do think it is a positive sign because, at some point, lines were crossed. Some candidates are just a bridge too far, and it may be the case with some of the other appointees,\" he added.",
      "Steven Cheung, Trump's choice for White House communications director and campaign spokesman, reiterated his claim that \"voters gave President Trump a mandate to choose Cabinet nominees that reflect the will of the American people and he will continue to do so.\"",
      "\"President Trump appreciates the advice and consent of Senators on Capitol Hill, but ultimately this is his administration,\" he said in a statement after Gaetz withdrew.",
      "Hanson predicted there will continue to be increased scrutiny of Trump's Cabinet picks as Senate confirmation hearings get closer, but he warned that the opposition might have limits.",
      "\"It depends on how much fight will come from Democrats and interest groups that engage with politics. It will be interesting to see what happens because there is plenty of opportunity here for Democrats in the Senate to make a lot of noise,\" he said.",
      "\"We will also be in a situation where there may be only enough clout and power to fight only the most controversial of nominees and let others pass,\" he said.",
      "Spinner-Halev said that Republican senators, in particular, may not want to cross Trump too many times and may just limit their opposition to his picks with the most baggage.",
      "\"One of the worries the Republicans will have is if a person [who is nominated] is incompetent,\" he said. \"The danger for the Trump administration and Republicans general is if these people are incompetent and mess up and then the public notices. This is what happened with George W. Bush and [Hurricane] Katrina where he said [FEMA Director Michael Brown] was doing a 'heck of a job.' That hurt him badly.\"",
      "Queen said there is a possibility that some Republican senators may put ethics before partisanship when all is said and done.",
      "\"It's not unreasonable to assume that there are a number of senators who realize there will be consequences of their choices and their decisions that it will be bad for the country as a whole,\" he said.",
      "In the long term, Hanson said it is unclear if Trump's selections will usher in a new norm of presidential picks who buck ethics and experience standards.",
      "He noted that American history has shown several cycles of reform brought on by demand of a public frustrated with dysfunction and improper behavior, such as in the aftermath of the Nixon administration in the 1970s.",
      "\"Now that they see what is happening, they may be reminded what the Trump presidency was like the first time around,\" he said of Americans who supported him. \"There may be a bunch of people who say this is not what I voted for, and that could affect things tremendously.\"",
      "Spinner-Halev said the future will depend on how informed the public is over the next four years.",
      "\"There is a lot that happens in Washington that's not in the public eye, and I think it's important that the public keeps an eye on the bureaucratic ongoings,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Ballard Partners, whose founder has personal ties to Donald Trump, seems poised to profit from Trump's return to Washington, raising concerns from some ethics experts.",
    "story": [
      "Ballard Partners\u2019 clients include TikTok, Nippon Steel and Amazon.",
      "When government officials in the Dominican Republic desperately sought COVID-19 drugs in July of 2020 -- as the U.S., under the Trump administration, was stockpiling the world's supply of remdesivir -- they turned to a lobbying firm with deep ties to Donald Trump that they had been paying more than $100,000 a month.",
      "\"We have an urgent need for these and [pharmaceutical company] Gilead is requesting WH approval for Gilead to provide these through diplomatic channels to the DR Presidential Palace,\" an official from the Dominican Republic's consulate wrote to veteran lobbyist Brian Ballard.",
      "Within a matter of hours, the solution to the Dominican Republic's problem was in motion, with Ballard directly connecting the official with Anand Shah, then a deputy commissioner at the Food and Drug Association, according to an email filed with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.",
      "\"We have had the privilege of representing the Dominican Republic for several years and have been very pleased with the pro American policies of the government. I hope you might advise on the best way forward to assist on this critical matter,\" Ballard wrote.",
      "The exchange illustrates one example of the kind of services for which foreign and domestic clients flocked to Ballard Partners during Trump's first administration. After nearly two decades in business servicing mainly Florida clients, the firm emerged as a dominant force in Trump's Washington, notching blue-clip clients like Amazon, American Airlines and Uber and earning more than $24 million in federal domestic lobbying in 2020, just four years after opening their first D.C. office.",
      "While the firm's massive growth stalled slightly after Trump left office, the firm appears well positioned to profit from Trump's return to the White House, prompting concerns from some consumer advocacy groups and several ethics experts.",
      "This election cycle, Ballard bundled a total of $1.8 million in campaign contributions for a Trump fundraising vehicle from other donors -- and Trump's chief of staff, Susie Wiles, and his nominee for attorney general, Pam Bondi, both worked at various times as registered lobbyists with the company. Wiles worked at the lobbying firm for eight years -- leaving the firm in 2019 -- and Bondi has been a partner since 2019. After leaving Ballard Partners, Wiles ran Trump's Florida campaign in 2020, worked for Mercury Public Affairs, then served as Trump's campaign manager for this election cycle.",
      "\"It's definitely two of the most important positions in the federal government,\" said Virginia Canter, chief ethics counsel at the progressive watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \"And the fact that they're both coming from the same lobbying firm sends a powerful message: 'If you have interests that need to be protected ... we've got friends.'\"",
      "While administrations from both parties have routinely filled government positions with former lobbyists, Trump's decision to tap two loyalists whose most recent prior job experience was lobbying has prompted concerns about the revolving door of politics and questions about Trump's vow to \"drain the swamp.\"",
      "\"The pitch in the election was that the swamp is too swampy and the working class has been ignored, and corporations have been sending their jobs abroad,\" said Jon Golinger, an advocate at the progressive consumer advocacy group Public Citizen. \u201cWe'll be looking to see whether those issues are prioritized, or whether it's the same old business as usual with new people in charge.\"",
      "\"Susie Wiles and Pam Bondi are highly respected individuals who have proven deeply loyal to President Trump and the American people who just re-elected him,\" said incoming White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in a statement to ABC News. \"Pam, Susie, and all of President Trump's nominees will abide by all ethical obligations in their respective roles.\"",
      "As Trump inched closer to the White House over the last year, Ballard Partners also signed high-profile clients with key stakes affected by federal policy, including Japanese steel giant Nippon Steel, whose merger with U.S. Steel is opposed by both Trump and President Joe Biden, and TikTok, which could be banned if its owner does not sell the app to a non-Chinese entity.",
      "Ballard Partners is also registered as a foreign agent for the Embassy of Japan since last year, making more than $300,000 for their work so far, per government filings. According to Department of Justice disclosures, Ballard has facilitated meetings and phone calls with journalists and lawmakers on behalf of the Japanese embassy.",
      "In October, the Embassy for the Republic of Sudan -- which is embroiled in a civil war between two rival parts of its military government that has displaced more than 8 million people and killed 15,000 -- signed a $50,000-a-month contract with Ballard Partners for assistance with \"communications with U.S. government officials and decision makers,\" according to federal disclosures.",
      "\"If you're a company or a government or another organization, you're hiring Ballard Partners because you think they can open doors for you,\" said Nick Schwellenbach, a senior investigator at the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. \"They're very intertwined at the highest levels with the incoming Trump administration, and they stand to profit significantly.\"",
      "Ballard Partners quickly established itself in Washington during the first Trump administration, after focusing predominantly on lobbying Florida officials, including on behalf of Trump's businesses. Brian Ballard first got to know Trump a few years after Trump purchased the Mar-a-Lago estate that's now his home, when Ballard penned a letter to Trump to praise him about his 1987 bestselling book, \"The Art of the Deal.\"",
      "\"When the president was elected, a lot of corporations we represent in Florida and folks from around the county started to call up and say, 'We don't know folks in the administration' and 'We'd like to get to know some folks in the administration,'\" Ballard told the Tallahassee Democrat in 2017.",
      "Ballard Partners declined a request for comment from ABC News for this story.",
      "Ballard Partners opened up its first D.C. office in 2017, quickly signing clients and making $9.8 million in domestic federal lobbying revenue during that first year, according to disclosures. By 2018, they doubled their revenue to $18.2 million before peaking in 2020 with $24.5 million in revenue from domestic federal lobbying.",
      "The company made $1.8 million lobbying on behalf of the private prison operator Geo Group amid Trump's crackdown on immigration, and made $1.64 million from French wine and spirits maker Pernod Ricard, $860,000 from General Motors, $780,000 from Boeing, $420,000 from Uber, $360,000 from Major League Baseball, and $150,000 from DraftKings, according to financial disclosures.",
      "\"Mr. Ballard, a Republican National Committee finance vice chair and Trump super-donor, had built his firm around his personal connections to President Trump,\" the Democrats on the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability wrote in a 2024 report entitled \"White House for Sale: How Princes, Prime Ministers, and Premiers Paid off President Trump.\"",
      "According to the report, Trump's businesses received millions of dollars from foreign entities located in 20 different countries during Trump's presidency. After the report was published, Trump's son Eric Trump, who helped run the Trump Organization while Trump was president, told ABC News in a statement that the House Democrats' \"narrative is insane,\" citing profits that Trump voluntarily donated to the Treasury Department to offset his business earnings from foreign entities.",
      "Ballard Partners also made millions by working as agents for foreign countries, with deals to represent Turkey and the Turkish bank Halkbank for $125,000 a month while the U.S. Justice Department probed the bank for allegedly violating Iranian sanctions. The lobbying firm made $2 million from Halkbank before dropping the bank as a client after the Justice Department indicted the bank for evading the U.S. sanctions on Iran in 2019. Halkbank has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "In other foreign lobbying, Ballard Partners represented the government of Kosovo while it negotiated with neighboring Serbia; it advocated for lifting U.S. sanctions against Zimbabwe; it sought to improve U.S.-Guatemala bilateral relations; and it represented an exiled Democratic Republic of the Congo opposition leader.",
      "As registered foreign agents, Bondi represented Qatar from 2019 to 2020 for work related to anti-human trafficking efforts, and Wiles represented one of Nigeria's main political parties for two months in 2019.",
      "After reaching its peak revenue of $24.5 million in federal domestic lobbying in 2020, Ballard Partners gradually lost business as the control of power in Washington shifted from Trump to Biden, making approximately $18 million in both 2021 and 2022 as lobbying firms with ties to Biden and his administration flourished.",
      "\"We had a wonderful run, we're going to be here to stay, but it's not going to be the same,\" Brian Ballard told The Hill in 2021.",
      "But with Trump returning to Washington in a matter of weeks, Ballard appears poised to benefit from a second wind -- in part because former lobbyists Wiles and Bondi will occupy top positions in the administration, according to the experts who spoke to ABC News.",
      "\"There's a lot of opportunity here for their former firm and their former clients, even though there are ethics restrictions in place,\" Canter said, regarding federal regulations that prohibit government employees from working on matters involving their former employer or former clients within the past year.",
      "The concern, Canter said, is that the public might not be best served by the arrangement.",
      "\"Corporate interests will take precedence over the public interest,\" she said.",

      "A U.S. Senate subcommittee has held a hearing to question the growing use of airline fees to charge passengers for things like early boarding and better seats",
      "Members of a U.S. Senate subcommittee took aim at airline executives Wednesday for using an expanding menu of fees to charge customers for early boarding, better seats and other comforts that used to be part of the ticket price.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he thinks the federal government should review and perhaps fine the airlines for their use of what he called junk fees.",
      "Blumenthal, the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said seat fees were pure profit for the airlines because they don't have to create new seats or incur other expenses by allowing customers to pick where to sit.",
      "Some senators expressed frustration during Wednesday's hearing when airline executives could not explain how they set the amount of various fees. They said the vagaries of airline pricing make it hard for consumers to budget for trips.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all captives on your airplanes at a certain point. You just say, \u2018You want to pick seat? We\u2019re just going to charge you some random amount more,\u2019\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., said. \u201cIt would be good if you guys could be transparent about what you do and why.\u201d",
      "The fees don't seem to be discouraging anybody. Americans are flying more than ever.",
      "The Transportation Security Administration reported screening nearly 3.1 million travelers at airports around the country on Sunday, a new single-day record. The 15 busiest days in TSA history have all occurred this year, with traffic at airport checkpoints up 5% over 2023.",

      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., sparred with executives of Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines, which paid employees $26 million in bonuses for spotting customers whose carry-on bags were too big to fit under a seat.

      "\u201cIf people want to know why it\u2019s such a terrible experience to fly, this is news for them today,\u201d Hawley told the airlines executives Wednesday. \u201cYour airlines are paying millions of dollars to your employees to harass people who have already paid!\u201d",
      "Frontier Chief Commercial Officer Robert Schroeter and his counterpart at Spirit, Matthew Klein, said ensuring that people follow the rules was a matter of fairness to all passengers.",

      "\u201cOverall, our job is to generate the most revenue we can so we can keep profitable as an airline,\u201d he said.",
      "U.S. airlines raised more than $7 billion from fees on checked bags last year, with American Airlines and United Airlines leading the pack. They scooped up another $1 billion in ticket-change and cancellation fees, although that was about one-third of what they raised before the coronavirus pandemic, when the biggest airlines dropped change fees.",
      "Exact figures on other types of fees are hard to determine, but the Senate panel reported last week that United, American, Delta Air Lines, Frontier and Spirit collected a combined total of more than $12 billion in seat fees between 2018 and 2023. That included charges for things such as more legroom or an aisle seat near the front of the plane.",
      "Airline fees have been a frequent target of criticism by the Biden administration, all the way up to President Joe Biden.",
      "A Transportation Department rule that took effect in October requires airlines to make automatic cash refunds for tickets and fees when flights are canceled.",
      "The airline industry is suing to block another regulation requiring more prominent disclosure of baggage and cancellation fees. An appeals court has blocked that rule, and its fate is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump. Blumenthal asked the five executives to drop the lawsuit. None agreed to do so.",

    "story": [
      "State and federal authorities in Louisiana celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious $330 million conservation project intended to revitalize one of the state's largest swamp ecosystems by reconnecting it with the Mississippi River",
      "GARYVILLE, La. -- Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands.",
      "The 176 square mile (456 square kilometers) Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second largest contiguous forest, a beloved state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds.",
      "Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost.",
      "State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp.",
      "\u201cThis is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be,\u201d said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006.",
      "Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: \u201cThe swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.\u201d",
      "The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 2000 cubic feet per second (57 cubic meters per second) to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 5.5 miles (9 kilometers) diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 45,000 acres (182 square kilometers) of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence \u2014 a natural phenomenon on Louisiana\u2019s fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction \u2014 and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University\u2019s wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added.",
      "\u201cAll of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.\u201d",
      "The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said.",
      "These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there's less healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe whole system has shifted.\u201d",
      "Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project\u2019s anticipated completion in 2028.",
      "Unlike the state\u2019s controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities.",
      "The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 18.5 miles (30 kilometers) levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 9,000 acres (36 square kilometers) of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds towards the diversion program.",
      "\u201cFor every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest\" in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council.",
      "And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you\u2019re going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it\u2019s going to allow the levees to be more effective,\u201d said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation\u2019s Gulf Program senior director. \u201cThis is how we need to be thinking at large about what\u2019s possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature.\""

      "THOMSON, Ga. -- The mayor of a small Georgia town is back in charge after a jury acquitted him of charges that he intentionally left a bottle of gin in a ditch for a state prison work crew.",
      "McDuffie County jurors on Tuesday found Thomson Mayor Benjamin \u201cBenji\u201d Cranford not guilty of furnishing prohibited items to inmates and attempting to commit a felony.",
      "Cranford was later suspended by Gov. Brian Kemp, but his acquittal restores him to office and entitles him to back pay.",
      "No one disputes that Cranford bought a bottle of Seagram's Extra Dry Gin from a liquor store on the afternoon of June 3 and then drove directly across a road and dropped the bottle in the ditch. But while prosecutors alleged the deposit was an intentional act, Cranford's defense lawyers suggested that the bottle fell out of Cranford's white SUV after he opened the door while fiddling with his Bluetooth wireless connection.",
      "Testifying in his own defense, WRDW-TV reports that Cranford told jurors he doesn't remember what happened. He said he probably put one of the two bottles of liquor he purchased in the cupholder in the driver's side door. Cranford said he had probably opened and closed his car door to reconnect the Bluetooth, but said he didn't remember why he drove across the road to do so.",
      "Although there are other ways to reset the connection, Cranford testified that he is \u201cnot tech savvy\" and had always done so by opening and closing his SUV's door.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019ve always done it,\" Cranford testified. \"If that\u2019s the right way or the wrong way, you tell me.\u201d",
      "Cranford testified he was buying gin because a friend told him it would prevent him from getting malaria. The quinine included in tonic water, which is often mixed with gin, can prevent the mosquito-borne disease.",
      "Cranford said he knew no one on the work crew from the Jefferson County Correctional Institution and had no reason to buy alcohol for people he didn't know.",
      "Prosecutors, though, argued that Cranford knew what he was doing.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if there was a specific target for the alcohol \u2014 if it was for one person or all of the inmates,\" Assistant District Attorney Terry Lloyd told jurors, according to WRDW-TV. \u201cBut what is clear is his intent to leave the alcohol in the ditch for the inmates.\u201d",
      "Alvin James, who was driving the inmate work crew bus, testified that passersby have tossed cigarettes, vapes and marijuana to inmates working in roadside cleanup crews before, so he watches carefully. Surveillance video from the liquor store shows Cranford entering and exiting the store, driving across the road, and then driving away, shortly before James pulls up in the bus and emerges to lean over the roadside ditch.",
      "James testified that he found the bottle and photographed it, and when Cranford drove back by, photographed Cranford's license plate. That started the police investigation that led to Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents marching a handcuffed Cranford out of Thomson City Hall before television cameras."

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jerry Nadler says that he will be stepping down as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee next year",
      "WASHINGTON -- Rep. Jerry Nadler announced Wednesday that he will be stepping down as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee next year, avoiding an intra-party fight over a prominent position as the party prepares to confront a second Trump presidency.",
      "Nadler's decision to relinquish control of the powerful committee came a day after fellow Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin announced his bid for the job and quickly amassed support from colleagues.",
      "\u201cI am also proud that, under my leadership, some of our caucus\u2019s most talented rising stars have been given a platform to demonstrate their leadership and their abilities,\u201d Nadler wrote in the letter to Democrats that was obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cThat includes Jamie Raskin, who in just a few terms in Congress has already proven himself to be an exceptional leader and spokesperson for our party\u2019s values.\u201d",
      "The 77-year-old chose to step aside as the Democratic party undergoes an internal reckoning over their losses in the election, which swept Republicans into a trifecta of power in Washington. Many Democrats are eager for generational change and a new approach as President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House.",
      "The decision by Nadler, who is serving his 17th term in Congress, reflects that generational shift. Before he made his decision Wednesday morning, Nadler spent time speaking with staff about what his next step should be. He also made a call to Raskin, which was described as cordial by a person familiar with the conversation who was not authorized to discuss it publicly.",
      "\u201cJerry Nadler is an extraordinary lawyer, patriot and public servant,\u201d Raskin posted on X. \u201cHis dogged defense of civil rights and civil liberties is a great inspiration to our people.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cI am honored and humbled to have his support in the battles ahead.\u201d",
      "Democratic Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries also reached out to Nadler, according to the same person, and offered him an emeritus status on the Judiciary committee, an honorary title that recognizes a member's seniority and service to the chamber. Nadler said he plans to stay on the committee as a senior member and will likely take up a ranking member role on one of the various subcommittees.",
      "But despite the cordial back-and-forth, the timeline of events that led to Raskin's surprise bid and Nadler's swift decision to step down damaged a close friendship between the two men.",
      "Nadler's staff had expected that there would likely be a challenger for the ranking member spot. And a week before Thanksgiving, they heard that Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, was making the rounds, talking to Democratic colleagues about a potential run.",
      "Nadler, who ran the vote counting operation to successfully land Raskin the top spot on the House Oversight Committee, confronted the Maryland lawmaker, who denied he was making a play for the job, according to the same person. Raskin told him that he would soon put out a letter announcing that he would run for the Oversight post again.",
      "Raskin's office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "That letter never came and when Nadler inquired again about it days later, Raskin softened his stance, according to the person, saying that he was hearing from a lot of people that he should run.",
      "On Saturday, reports came out of Raskin pursuing the post before he made it official with a letter to colleagues on Monday.",
      "He wrote that the Judiciary Committee under his leadership would become \u201cthe headquarters of Congressional opposition to authoritarianism\u201d as well as other efforts by Trump and his allies to thwart the Constitution.",
      "It was a stunning turn of events given that over the years Democrats have rarely broken from the seniority system for committee assignments, no matter how long someone has held a position, making the outcome of the race uncertain.",
      "But being the face of the resistance against Trump is not new territory for Raskin who spent the last two years on the House Oversight committee as the most vocal defender of President Joe Biden and his family as they faced a sprawling Republican investigation \u2014 encouraged by Trump \u2014 into their various business affairs.",
      "He also helped draft articles of impeachment against the incoming president for his encouragement of the violent mob on Jan. 6, 2021, and led the impeachment prosecution in the Senate.",
      "\u201cAs our country faces the return of Donald Trump, and the renewed threats to our democracy and our way of life that he represents, I am very confident that Jamie would ably lead the Judiciary Committee as we confront this growing danger,\u201d Nadler wrote at the end of his letter.",

      "DETROIT -- The Michigan Court of Appeals declined to overturn a light jail sentence for a young woman who killed her father by burning him with a dangerous powder when he couldn't drive her to a hair appointment before her 18th birthday party.",
      "Megan Imirowicz, now 21, was sentenced to a year in jail in 2023. She was immediately released because she had already spent roughly 17 months in custody before trial and while awaiting her punishment.",

      "The conservative-majority Supreme Court appeared likely to uphold Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors as it heard the most high-profile case of its term on Wednesday",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court heard the most high-profile case of its term on Wednesday, weighing Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors.",
      "Similar laws have been passed by other conservative-leaning states. Challengers say they deprive kids of treatment they need, while the states defend them as protecting minors from life-changing decisions.",
      "The conservative-majority court appeared ready to uphold Tennessee's law. It comes against the backdrop of escalating pushback to transgender rights, notably from President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the arguments:",
      "In the arguments on Wednesday, five of the court's six conservatives seemed skeptical of the argument that the ban on gender-affirming care for minors is discriminatory.",
      "Two key conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, repeatedly challenged the arguments from lawyers challenging the ban.",
      "Roberts questioned whether judges should be weighing in on a question of regulating medical procedures, an area usually left to state lawmakers. Barrett sounded skeptical of the administration\u2019s argument that the law discriminates because of sex.",
      "Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch was notably silent, asking no questions.",
      "The court\u2019s other three conservatives seemed to favor Tennessee. The three liberals largely backed the challengers, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor highlighting the risks of suicide among kids with gender dysphoria.",
      "The litigation marked only the second time the high court has heard a case that represented a fundamental test of transgender rights.",
      "In a case involving LGBTQ+ rights four years ago, two conservative justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, joined with its liberals to expand protections for transgender workers. Barrett wasn\u2019t on the bench at the time and had no record on transgender rights.",
      "Gorsuch wrote the opinion, which left open claims of discrimination in other situations.",
      "The court isn\u2019t expected to rule for several months. The decision could have direct effects in the 26 states that have passed versions of the bans, and might have ripple effects on other measures that restrict sports participation and bathroom use by transgender people.",
      "Supporters of the health care laws argue the gender-affirming treatments are risky, and the laws protect kids from making decisions before they\u2019re ready.",
      "Challengers say many medical interventions come with some degree of risk, and families should be able to weigh those against the benefits. The arguments in favor of Tennessee\u2019s ban could also be used to back federal restrictions, said Chase Strangio, the ACLU attorney who represented three families challenging the law.",
      "Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said that his state\u2019s arguments would still let each state set its own policy."

      "Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta says it will build a $10 billion artificial intelligence data center in northeast Louisiana",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The largest artificial intelligence data center ever built by Facebook\u2019s parent company Meta is coming to northeast Louisiana, the company said Wednesday, bringing hopes that the $10 billion facility will transform an economically neglected corner of the state.",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry called it \u201cgame-changing\u201d for his state's expanding tech sector, yet some environmental groups have raised concerns over the center's reliance on fossil fuels \u2014 and whether the plans for new natural gas power to support it could lead to higher energy bills in the future for Louisiana residents.",
      "Meanwhile, Elon Musk's AI startup, xAI, is expanding its existing supercomputer project in Memphis, Tennessee, the city's chamber of commerce said Wednesday. The chamber also said that Nvidia, Dell, and Supermicro Computer will be \u201cestablishing operations in Memphis,\u201d without offering further details.",
      "Louisiana is among a growing number of states offering tax credits and other incentives to lure big tech firms seeking sites for energy-intensive data centers.",
      "The U.S. Commerce Department found that there aren\u2019t enough data centers in the U.S. to meet the rising AI-fueled demand, which is projected to grow by 9% each year through 2030, citing industry reports.",
      "Meta anticipates its Louisiana data center will create 500 operational jobs and 5,000 temporary construction jobs, said Kevin Janda, director of data center strategy. At 4 million square feet (370,000 square meters), it will be the company's largest AI data center to date, he added.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure we are having a positive impact on the local level,\u201d Janda said.",
      "Congressional leaders and local representatives from across the political spectrum heralded the Meta facility as a boon for Richland parish, a rural part of Louisiana with a population of 20,000 historically reliant on agriculture. About one in four residents are considered to live in poverty and the parish has an employment rate below 50%, according to the U.S. census data.",
      "Meta plans to invest $200 million into road and water infrastructure improvements for the parish to offset its water usage. The facility is expected to be completed in 2030.",
      "Entergy, one of the nation's largest utility providers, is fast-tracking plans to build three natural gas power plants in Louisiana capable of generating 2,262 megawatts for Meta's data center over a 15-year period \u2014 nearly one-tenth of Entergy's existing energy capacity across four states.",
      "The Louisiana Public Service Commission is weighing Entergy's proposal as some environmental groups have opposed locking the state into more fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure. Meta said it plans to help bring 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy onto the grid in the future.",
      "Louisiana residents may ultimately end up with rate increases to pay off the cost of operating these natural gas power plants when Meta's contract with Entergy expires, said Jessica Hendricks, state policy director for the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a Louisiana-based nonprofit advocating for energy consumers.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why residential customers in Louisiana need to pay for a power plant for energy that they\u2019re not going to use,\" Hendricks said. \"And we want to make sure that there\u2019s safeguards in place.\u201d",
      "Public service commissioner Foster Campbell, representing northeast Louisiana, said he does not believe the data center will increase rates for Louisiana residents and views it as vital for his region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going in one of the most needed places in Louisiana and maybe one of the most needed places in the United States of America,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI\u2019m for it 100%.\u201d",
      "Environmental groups have also warned of the pollution generated by Musk's AI data center in Memphis. The Southern Environmental Law Center, among others, says the supercomputer could strain the power grid, prompting attention from the Environmental Protection Agency. Eighteen gas turbines currently running at xAI\u2019s south Memphis facility are significant sources of ground-level ozone, better known as smog, the group said.",
      "Patrick Anderson, an attorney at the law center, said xAI has operated with \u201ca stunning lack of transparency\u201d in developing its South Memphis facility, which is located near predominantly Black neighborhoods that have long dealt with pollution and health risks from factories and other industrial sites.",
      "\u201cMemphians deserve to know how xAI will affect them,\u201d he said, \u201cand should have a seat at the table when these decisions are being made.\u201d",

      "Trump's brief call was more celebratory than a prescriptive policy agenda, according to those attending the private GOP retreat, encouraging the senators to confirm his Cabinet nominees as they launch an agenda of tax cuts, deportations and other priorities.",
      "\"It was a love fest,\" said Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo. \u201cThere was a real sense of unity in the room.\u201d",

      "Thune detailed a potential two-part strategy that would have senators working on an initial legislative package \u2014 energy, border security and defense priorities \u2014 that could be approved in the first 30 days of the new administration.",
      "Next, Thune explained that the senators would turn to tax cuts \u2014 reviving the expiring tax cuts from Trump's first term \u2014 which is expected to take longer, dragging into the year.",
      "The new Congress convenes Jan. 3, when lawmakers are sworn into office, and the Senate expects to quickly begin holding confirmation hearings for Trump\u2019s top Cabinet nominees \u2014 some of whom are already running into resistance.",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A former police detective in Kansas who died in an apparent suicide as he was about to stand trial on civil rights violations for allegedly sexually assaulting and terrorizing vulnerable women for decades wasn't supposed to have a gun while he was under house arrest.",
      "Police found Roger Golubski dead on his back porch Monday morning after a neighbor reported hearing a gunshot, and there were no indications of foul play, the Kansas Bureau of Investigation said in a statement. The judge\u2019s order allowing Golubski to be under house arrest said he could not \u201cpossess a firearm, destructive device, or other weapon.\u201d",
      "Golubski's death \u2014 just as jury selection was to begin at the federal courthouse in Topeka \u2014 raised questions about why the 71-year-old wasn't behind bars, and how a gun came to be at his home in Edwardsville, outside Kansas City, Kansas.",
      "\"We will look into how he obtained the firearm as a part of the death investigation,\u201d said Melissa Underwood, a bureau spokeswoman.",
      "Golubski, once a highly regarded detective in Kansas City, was charged in 2022 with six felony counts of violating the civil rights of women and girls. Prosecutors say he sexually abused them and sometimes threatened to throw them or their relatives in jail if they didn't comply.",
      "The trial was to focus on two women. One said Golubski began sexually abusing her when she was in middle school. The other said he began abusing her after her twin sons were arrested. Prosecutors said seven other women were planning to testify that Golubski abused or harassed them as well. Advocates for the women believe there are other victims who have either died or are afraid to come forward.",
      "Prosecutors say that Golubski, who was white, victimized Black women and girls in some of Kansas City\u2019s poorest neighborhoods.",
      "Golubski\u2019s prosecution followed hundreds of abuse cases across the country where officers lost their badges after allegations of sexual assault.",
      "After Golubski's death, the judge dismissed the case at the request of prosecutors.",
      "Prosecutors wanted Golubski jailed almost immediately. They asked to have him taken into custody two days after a federal grand jury indicted him in September 2022.",
      "But U.S. Magistrate Judge Rachel Schwartz rejected their request, concluding that while the allegations were \u201cshocking,\u201d Golubski was not the risk he was when the alleged abuse occurred years ago.",
      "An attorney for Golubski described him as \u201csick and infirm,\u201d saying he needed medical care for diabetes and to recover from quintuple bypass heart surgery. Golubski was undergoing kidney dialysis three times a week, and his trial was scheduled around those treatments.",
      "Golubski's accusers believe he had too much freedom under house arrest. Some of them were especially angry after they saw video of him at a Culver\u2019s restaurant following a medical appointment in January. Schwartz tightened conditions on Golubski\u2019s house arrest after that, but didn't order him detained.",
      "\u201cThe perception of people, rightly or wrongly, and regardless of the law, is that had they been in front of the court under similar circumstances, they probably would have been detained,\u201d Cheryl Pilate, an attorney for some of Golubski\u2019s accusers, said Tuesday.",
      "Barry Grissom, who served as the top federal prosecutor in Kansas from 2010 to 2016, said Golubski\u2019s longtime ties to the Kansas City area \u2014 something cited by the magistrate \u2014 argued against detention. Schwartz ordered Golubski to stay at home except for religious services and medical care. He was not allowed to get a passport.",
      "\u201cHe hadn\u2019t been found guilty \u2014 you know, it hadn\u2019t been proved \u2014 so he still, like anybody, was presumed innocent,\u201d Grissom said.",
      "That's unclear.",
      "Sean O'Brien, a University of Missouri-Kansas City law professor, said officers would have searched Golubski's home when his house arrest started, but added that \u201cit's not like they were surveilling his house 24/7.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut, you know, once he\u2019s there \u2014 you know, people coming and going \u2014 anybody could have brought a gun to him or maybe the search wasn\u2019t that thorough,\u201d O'Brien said.",
      "Golubski worked for decades for the Kansas City police department before retiring from there in 2010. He then worked for the Edwardsville police, leaving that department in 2016.",
      "Edwardsville Chief Rance Quinn said in an email Tuesday that the department issues firearms to its officers and those in good standing are allowed to store them outside the department. The firearm can become a gift to an employee who retires, but Golubski did not get such a gift upon leaving in 2016, Quinn said.",
      "Quinn said none of the department's firearms were missing Monday morning and that \"the firearm found on scene was not the make/model of firearm used by the Edwardsville PD.\u201d",
      "In Kansas City, police officers buy the firearms they'll use on duty from a list of approved weapons and, if they cover the cost themselves, keep them after leaving the department, said spokesperson Nancy Chartrand. It was not immediately clear whether Golubski did that.",
      "Christopher Joseph, Golubski's lead attorney, said in an email Tuesday that he'd expected to meet Golubski in Topeka on Monday morning and go to the courthouse, some 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of Golubski's home in Edwardsville. Golubski hadn't skipped a court appearance before Monday.",
      "\u201cI was in regular contact with Roger, including over the weekend,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cI saw no warning signs. His defense team was confident about the prospect of acquittal.\u201d",
      "Joseph said Golubski himself did not believe he could get a fair trial because of media coverage of his case and that he only learned Monday morning that Golubski was despondent over that coverage.",
      "\u201cRoger\u2019s death should not be considered an admission of guilt,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cInstead, it should be a warning about the power of the media to pick a narrative and present it as truth.\u201d",
      "Golubski was at the center of a string of lawsuits and criminal allegations that led the Wyandotte County prosecutor\u2019s office to begin a $1.7 million effort to reexamine cases he worked on during his 35 years on the force.",
      "One double murder case Golubski investigated resulted in the exoneration of a man wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for 23 years, and government payments totaling $14 million to the man. A criminal justice organization run by rapper Jay-Z is suing to obtain police records.",
      "Pilate said only a small subset of Golubski's victims were willing to come forward and that his trial would have represented \u201cjust a first step toward accountability\u201d for local police and government officials.",

      "Chief Justice John Roberts, who voted in the majority in a 2020 case in favor of transgender rights, questioned whether judges, rather than lawmakers, should be weighing in on a question of regulating medical procedures, an area usually left to the states.",
      "\u201dThe Constitution leaves that question to the people\u2019s representatives, rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor,\u201d Roberts said in an exchange with Strangio.",
      "The court\u2019s three liberal justices seemed firmly on the side of the challengers. But it\u2019s not clear that any of the conservatives will go along.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor pushed back against the assertion that the democratic process would be the best way to address objections to the law. She cited a history of laws discriminating against others, noting that transgender people make up less than 1% of the U.S. population, according to studies. There are an estimated 1.3 million adults and 300,000 adolescents aged 13 to 17 who identify as transgender, according the UCLA law school's Williams Institute.",
      "\u201cBlacks were a much larger part of the population and it didn\u2019t protect them. It didn\u2019t protect women for whole centuries,\u201d Sotomayor said in an exchange with Tennessee Solicitor General Matt Rice.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said she saw some troubling parallels between arguments made by Tennessee and those advanced by Virginia and rejected by a unanimous court, in the 1967 Loving decision that legalized interracial marriage nationwide.",
      "Quoting from the 57-year-old decision, Jackson noted that Virginia argued then that \u201cthe scientific evidence is substantially in doubt and, consequently, the court should defer to the wisdom of the state legislature.\u201d",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, who wrote the majority opinion in 2020, said nothing during the arguments.",
      "The arguments produced some riveting moments. Justice Samuel Alito repeatedly pressed Strangio, the first openly transgender lawyer to argue at the nation's highest court, about whether transgender people should be legally designated as a group that\u2019s susceptible to discrimination.",
      "Strangio answered that being transgender does fit that legal definition, though he acknowledged under Alito\u2019s questioning there are a small number of people who de-transition. \u201cSo it's not an immutable characteristic, is it?\u201d Alito said.",
      "Strangio did not retreat from his view, though he said the court did not have to decide the issue to resolve the case in his clients' favor.",
      "There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court\u2019s marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like \u201cChampion God\u2019s Design\u201d and \u201cKids Health Matters,\u201d while the other side proclaimed \u201cFight like a Mother for Trans Rights\u201d and \u201cFreedom to be Ourselves.\"",
      "Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.",
      "The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law urged the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that \u201csex plays an unmistakable role\u201d in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate.",
      "The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same.",
      "Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but allows the same drugs to be used for other purposes.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the administration's top Supreme Court lawyer, called the law sex-based line drawing to ban the use of drugs that have been safely prescribed for decades and said the state \u201cdecided to completely override the views of the patients, the parents, the doctors.\u201d",
      "She contrasted the Tennessee law with one enacted by West Virginia, which set conditions for the health care for transgender minors, but stopped short of an outright ban.",
      "Rice countered that lawmakers acted to regulate \u201crisky, unproven medical interventions\u201d and, at one point, likened the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments to lobotomies and eugenics, now thoroughly discredited but once endorsed by large segments of the medical community.",
      "Rice argued that the Tennessee law doesn\u2019t discriminate based on sex, but rather based on the purpose of the treatment. Children can get puberty blockers to treat early onset puberty, but not as a treatment for gender dysphoria.",
      "\u201cOur fundamental point is there is no sex-based line here,\u201d Rice said.",
      "While the challengers invoked the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relied on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states.",
      "The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise.",
      "The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority.",
      "The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it.",
      "If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it. That's the course Prelogar and Strangio pushed for on Wednesday, though there did not seem to be much support for it.",
      "Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association.",
      "But Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh all highlighted a point made by Tennessee in its legal briefs claiming that health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom found that the medical treatments \"pose significant risks with unproven benefits.\u201d",
      "If those countries \u201care pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" Kavanaugh said, why should the Supreme Court question Tennessee's actions?",
      "None of those countries has adopted a ban similar to the one in Tennessee and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar said.",
      "Kavanaugh, who has coached his daughters\u2019 youth basketball teams, also wondered whether a ruling against Tennessee would give transgender athletes \"a constitutional right to participate in girls' sports.\u201d",
      "Prelogar said a narrow decision would not affect the sports issue.",

      "The 13 new senators \u2014 nine Republicans and four Democrats \u2014 came to the Statehouse on Wednesday to meet, give five-minute introductory speeches, get their committee assignments and pick their seats. The session doesn't start for 40 more days.",

      "Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, says he'll run for Michigan governor in 2026 as an independent because \u201cthere are a lot of people in this country who are tired of both\u201d the Democratic and Republican parties",
      "DETROIT -- Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, says he will run for Michigan governor as an independent in 2026.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that there are a lot of people in this country who are tired of both parties and tired of the system,\" Duggan said in an interview Tuesday. \u201cAnd so I want to offer people a choice.\u201d",
      "Duggan, 66, is credited by many for leading Detroit after it emerged from bankruptcy to become a thriving, more vibrant city. He formally announced his intentions in a video released Wednesday morning but discussed his future before that with The Associated Press. He hopes to succeed popular Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is term-limited under Michigan law.",
      "The mayor\u2019s decision comes in the midst of a reckoning for Democrats in Michigan, one of a handful of swing states that helped propel former President Donald Trump to victory in November. The Democratic Party, which only two years previously had claimed a majority in both houses of the Legislature for the first time in decades, suffered setbacks at the ballot box that left state Democrats scrambling for explanations and a path forward.",
      "Still, few would have anticipated the mayor of the state\u2019s largest city and biggest Democratic stronghold abandoning his party altogether.",
      "Duggan said he felt he could govern more effectively as an independent.",
      "\u201cYou have a (state) legislature that\u2019s almost evenly divided that makes the stakes of each issue become magnified,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has gotten harder and harder to address things as the partisan climate has gotten more toxic.\"",
      "Duggan also could be looking to avoid what is shaping up as a crowded Democratic primary field. Among the potential contenders are Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist III and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson.",
      "U.S. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who relocated to Michigan in 2022, has also sparked speculation about a potential Democratic gubernatorial bid. When asked by the AP on Nov. 3 about a potential candidacy, Buttigieg left the door open.",
      "On the Republican side, prospective candidates include Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former state Attorney General Mike Cox, former state Rep. Tom Leonard and U.S. Rep. John James. Tudor Dixon, the Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2022, is also considering another run.",
      "Michigan Democratic Party Chair Lavora Barnes said in a statement that the potential Democratic primary field for governor is \u201cincredibly strong\u201d and that the party looks forward to ensuring it holds onto the office. Gov. Whitmer\u2019s office declined to comment Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThis changes the dynamic of the campaigns for governor,\u201d said Adolph Mongo, a Detroit-based political commentator and former political consultant. \u201cThere have been rumblings from folks that we need a third party, a real one.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a gutsy move. This is a good move,\u201d Mongo continued. \u201cIt hurts the Democratic Party. There\u2019s no question that he is going to take a ton of Democrats with him. It\u2019s also going to free up those moderate Republican who are not buying MAGA.\u201d",
      "Democrat Mark Bernstein, a regent at the University of Michigan, also says running as an independent will allow Duggan \u201cto lead free from partisan entanglements that have paralyzed Lansing for a long time.\u201d",
      "\u201cVoters do not care about political parties. They care about results and Mayor Duggan gets results,\u201d Bernstein said.",
      "\u201cI do believe that many voters, like me, feel homeless, right now,\u201d Bernstein continued. \u201cMany Republicans feel estranged from the Republican Party and many Democrats feel alienated by the Democratic Party.\u201d",
      "Republican and former Michigan Lt. Gov. Brian Calley said on X that Duggan checks the boxes of being a \u201ccredible, independent candidate with the ability to raise money.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there are huge advantages of having a political party behind you,\u201d Calley wrote. \u201cAnd being a target of the left and the right will be intense. 2026 is already very interesting.\"",
      "A Duggan run as an independent, while it further fractures a state Democratic Party still reeling from Trump's win in November, could win over voters looking outside the party for answers.",
      "There is precedent. Then-U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema from Arizona made the move in 2022 to independent. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin did the same last spring. Several states have elected independent governors since 1990, Duggan noted, including Angus King in Maine, now a U.S. senator.",
      "But an independent has never served as Michigan governor and third-party candidates typically don\u2019t fare well in elections for the state\u2019s top seat. Libertarian Party candidate Mary Buzuma received a scant 0.9% of the vote in 2022.",
      "Duggan must collect between 12,000 and 60,000 signatures from registered Michigan voters, ensuring at least 100 signatures from registered voters in at least seven of the state\u2019s 13 congressional districts.",
      "\u201cIf you think the two-party system is serving you well, you can vote for your Republican or Democratic candidate,\u201d Duggan said. \"But if you think the only way we can really change the quality of life in Michigan is a different way, I\u2019m going to give people the alternative, an independent who is going to go to Lansing and work with responsible leadership in both parties.\u201d",
      "Last month, Duggan announced that the coming year would be his last as Detroit's mayor. His current term ends in January 2026. Duggan said he then plans to \u201dgo to communities across the state that have been forgotten and sit in neighborhood restaurants and farmhouses and city centers and listen to people.\"",
      "Duggan spent about eight years as chief executive of the Detroit Medical Center. He served three years as Wayne County prosecutor and 14 years as deputy county executive.",
      "He was the top vote-getter in Detroit\u2019s 2013 mayoral primary despite running a write-in campaign due to a ballot challenge. Duggan, who is white, was elected in November 2013 to lead mostly Black Detroit which that summer was taken into the largest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history by a state-appointed manager.",
      "Long-term debt of $18 billion or more and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual budget deficits left Detroit broke and nearly broken. Crime was high and neighborhood blight was rampant. Unemployment and poverty rates were among the nation\u2019s highest.",
      "Taking office in January 2014, Duggan ran the city but initially had no control over spending. By that December, Detroit had emerged from bankruptcy with about $7 billion in debt erased or restructured.",
      "Over the past decade, Detroit routinely has had balanced city budgets and surpluses. Violent crime is down and neighborhoods mostly are cleaner. Detroit\u2019s population even increased slightly in 2023. It was the first uptick since the 1950s when 1.8 million people called the city home.",

      "Tarrio is serving a 22-year prison sentence related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Donald Trump supporters. A jury convicted him and other Proud Boys leaders of seditious conspiracy for a plot to stop the peaceful transfer of presidential power from Trump to Joe Biden after the 2020 election.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson will decide the case against Lamond after hearing testimony without a jury.",
      "On Monday, the judge said Tarrio was waiting for the outcome of last month\u2019s presidential election before deciding whether to testify at Lamond\u2019s trial. President-elect Trump, who repeatedly has vowed to pardon people convicted of Capitol riot charges, suggested he would consider pardoning Tarrio.",

Copeland testified on Wednesday that it would have helped investigators to know that Tarrio had privately confessed to Lamond. The Proud Boys leader also publicly admitted on social media and on a podcast that he had burned the banner.",

      "PALERMO, Calif. -- Two children were in \u201cextremely critical condition\u201d Wednesday after being shot at a tiny religious K-8 school in Northern California and the gunman died at the scene, apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot, police said.",
      "The gunman may have targeted the Feather River School of Seventh-Day Adventists in Palermo because of its religious affiliation, but isn't believed to have had a prior connection to the victims or the school, Butte County Sheriff Kory L. Honea said. He didn\u2019t explain further.",
      "\u201cWhether or not this is a hate crime or whether or not it\u2019s part of some sort of larger scheme at this point I don\u2019t have enough information to provide an answer to that,\u201d he said.",
      "The wounded children, boys ages 5 and 6, are kindergarteners at the school and are being treated at a trauma center in the Sacramento area, officials said.",
      "\u201cI am thankful that they\u2019re still alive, but they\u2019ve got a long road ahead of them,\" Honea said.",
      "The shooting occurred shortly after 1 p.m. at the private Christian school with fewer than three dozen students in Palermo, which has about 5,500 people and is about 65 miles (104 kilometers) north of Sacramento.",
      "It was the the latest among dozens of school shootings across the U.S. in recent years, including especially deadly ones in Newtown, Connecticut, Parkland, Florida, and Uvalde, Texas. The shootings have set off fervent debates about gun control and frayed the nerves of parents whose children are growing up accustomed to doing active shooter drills in their classrooms.",

      "The gunman's body was found near the slide and other playground equipment on the grounds of the school, which abuts ranchland where cattle graze. A handgun was found nearby, Honea said.",
      "Honea said they were trying to contact the shooter\u2019s family before releasing his name.",

      "Since winning election, President-elect Donald Trump has been talking about immigration, border security and government efficiency",
      "Since winning the election, President-elect Donald Trump has been talking about immigration, border security and government efficiency.",
      "But in California farm country, his comments about water are also getting top attention.",
      "The Golden State grows three-quarters of the country's fruits and nuts and more than a third of its vegetables, largely thanks to a complex network of dams and canals that funnel water to the state's fertile Central Valley.",
      "In recent years, farmers have faced more limits on how much water they can access from this network because of environmental concerns, as well as on how much groundwater they can pump after years of overuse and drought.",
      "Now, farmers are hoping the second Trump administration will ensure more stable water flows to their fields from the federally managed Central Valley Project and a plan for future water supplies. Trump recently posted on his Truth Social platform a criticism of the \u201crerouting of MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER A DAY FROM THE NORTH OUT INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, rather than using it, free of charge, for the towns, cities, & farms dotted all throughout California.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is the number one issue,\u201d said Jason Phillips, chief executive of the Friant Water Authority, which represents more than a dozen irrigation districts serving a large swath of the crop-rich valley. \u201cYou only need labor and you only need the products and the equipment and everything else to grow food if you have water.\u201d",
      "California relies on water supplies from the Central Valley Project and the state-run State Water Project. The federal project provides 5 million acre-feet of water to farms each year and 600,000 acre-feet to cities, as well as water to maintain water quality in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, which provides critical habitat to fish and wildlife.",
      "During the prior Trump administration, government officials issued rules to allow for a greater flow of water to California farms.",
      "The move was blasted by environmental groups. The Biden administration pushed back on those decisions and has been working on new rules aimed at balancing farming with protections for endangered wildlife such as the delta smelt, a tiny fish that is an indicator of the health of California's waterways, and Chinook salmon.",
      "In recent years, California farmers said federal water allocations have been more limited than they feel is necessary after two years of ample rain boosted the state's reservoirs. The state previously grappled with a yearslong drought that in 2022 saw the driest January-to-March period in at least a century, with scientists saying weather whiplash will likely become more common as the planet warms.",
      "That is a big concern of environmentalists and commercial fishermen, who want to see less water diverted to agriculture and more flowing to the delta. Salmon fishing has been banned off the California coast for the past two years because of dwindling stocks, and critics say Trump's prior decisions moving water away from salmon-spawning areas are to blame.",
      "\u201cThey delivered all the cold water behind Shasta Dam. It literally cooked the baby salmon before they were hatched,\u201d said Barry Nelson, policy advisor to the Golden State Salmon Association, a nonprofit focused on restoring California salmon. \u201cMath is a brutal master, and we've hit physical limits on the amount of water we can take from the Bay delta, and the sign of that is the collapse of the ecosystem.\u201d",
      "Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a long-time Trump critic, recently called on California lawmakers to gear up ahead of another Trump presidency to safeguard the state\u2019s progressive policies.",
      "Environmental advocates, however, contend Newsom has not done enough to improve the situation in the delta for fish and wildlife. During Trump's prior administration, Newsom opposed his rules for water flows, filing a legal challenge, but since then put forth his own rules, which Jon Rosenfield, San Francisco Baykeeper's science director, said \u201cwere never that much different.\u201d",
      "Competing demands on California's water have led to numerous battles over who gets how much. Advocates for fishermen, environmental interests and farmers all say more must be done to shore up future water supplies. But what that looks like depends on who is asked, with proposed solutions spanning from more conservation to expanding water storage to technological upgrades.",
      "Aubrey Bettencourt, who oversaw Department of Interior water policy during the prior Trump administration, said she would like to see the system updated to respond to swings in climate rather than setting water releases based on the calendar. One of the issues, she said, is not how much water you get but knowing how much water you will get.",
      "\u201cIt makes it very hard to plan not just as a farmer but as a city manager,\u201d she said. \u201cI would expect an emphasis on restoring operational certainty.\u201d",
      "The incoming Trump administration has discussed a series of economic policies that could also affect agriculture, including tariffs that could wind up affecting some exports and push up input costs for growers, according to a recent Rabobank report.",

      "Hegseth sometimes conveys his conservative Christian outlook in militaristic terms, has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians against Muslims, and evokes the specter of Islamists seeking to impose their faith on non-Muslims.

      "Recent decades have seen the military\u2019s first Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist chaplains. The military has also made accommodations such as allowing Sikhs to maintain their religiously mandated turbans and beards.",

      "He has written of America as a Judeo-Christian nation, portraying the founders as Christians despite what historians say were their diverse religious views. He said Americans of any religion are welcome in a \u201crighteous crusade for human freedom,\" though he often fuses Christian and American identity. \u201cWe Christians \u2014 alongside our Jewish friends and their remarkable army in Israel \u2014 need to pick up the sword of unapologetic Americanism and defend ourselves,\" he wrote in his 2020 book, \u201cAmerican Crusade.\u201d",

      "Some concerns about Hegseth center on his views toward Islam and the religious motivations he cites for supporting Israel.",

      "Hegseth bears a prominent tattoo proclaiming \u201cDeus Vult,\u201d (\u201cGod Wills It\u201d), the Latin phrase attributed to the 11th century pope who called the First Crusade. That launched two centuries of fierce, intermittent warfare between Christian and Muslim armies in and around the Holy Land.",
      "Hegseth wrote in his book that he wasn\u2019t romanticizing the Crusades and but said the \u201cpresent moment is much like the eleventh century.\u201d He called for Christians, Jews and the Israeli army to \u201cpush Islamism back,\" culturally and when necessary militarily.",
      "He defined Islamism as an ideology imposing Islam on others. He contended that moderate Muslims may be peaceful but are either \u201ccomplicit in Islamism\u2019s expansion or impotent to reverse it.\u201d",

      "Robbie Anderson told the BBC he felt \"taken advantage of\" after his house sale fell through despite having the insulation fitted under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon has written to the energy secretary calling for \"decisive action\", while the Department for Housing has said it is consulting with lenders.",
      "Estimates suggest as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's official scheme.",
      "The Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England, saw installations completely subsidised for those on certain benefits.",

      "Industry experts have told the BBC spray foam is an effective insulator if fitted properly, and urgent action is needed to stop panicked homeowners needlessly turning to \"cowboy\" removal companies.",
      "Lenders reject homes with spray foam insulation",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",

      "He and his wife hoped to move to a bigger house in Nottingham, closer to potential secondary schools for their young daughter.",
      "When they put their house on the market this summer, they quickly received an offer at asking price. But Robbie said he was \"shocked\" when the buyers' lenders rejected the property and they pulled out of the purchase.",
      "The work was carried out by a Trustmark-approved installer and Robbie was given documentation including a British Board of Agreement (BBA) product certificate.",
      "But the prospective buyers' mortgage provider said it needed an insurance-backed installation warranty with a minimum of 10 years, despite Robbie having one with the industry standard of two years.",
      "He told the BBC he felt a \"little bit betrayed\" and confused over what to do next, with 12 months remaining on their current mortgage.",
      "The couple are planning to remove the insulation themselves, having been quoted \u00a34,000.",

      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "Geoff Hunt, an independent chartered building surveyor, said open cell spray foam had gained popularity in recent years, bolstered by government initiatives.",
      "But he said mortgage lenders struggle to assess spray foam, leading to \"caution and refusals on higher-risk applications\", for example, where it has been applied directly onto roof tiles.",
      "Properly-installed open cell foam on a sound roof has not been conclusively linked to roof decay, he added, emphasising that it is important for homeowners with this type of insulation not to panic.",
      "'Conned'",
      "Philippa from Wiltshire also had open cell spray foam fitted in her loft in 2021, with the \u00a38,662 cost covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "She recently accepted an offer from first-time buyers on her property, but said Nationwide would not lend to them without further paperwork on the insulation.",
      "She said this \"spooked\" her buyers and they pulled out before she had the chance to supply the additional documents.",
      "Nationwide told the BBC it was \"unable to make a final lending decision\" without documentary evidence that spray foam was installed correctly or a report on the structural integrity of the roof.",
      "Philippa said she cannot afford to remove the insulation and has reduced her asking price to cover the cost on any future buyer\u2019s side.",
      "\"I feel like I've been conned by the government,\" she said, adding that she did not believe spray foam insulation should be available for sale until there is a better understanding of the product.",
      "'Un-mortgageable'",
      "While the Green Homes Grant scheme closed in 2021, spray foam insulation is still available under the Great British Insulation Scheme as the government seeks to improve the energy efficiency of homes and drives towards its 2030 \"net zero\" target.",
      "Rico Wojtulewicz, head of policy at the National Federation of Builders, said he had been trying to raise awareness of potential issues with spray foam insulation for years.",
      "\"Government may view spray foam as an easy solution but an un-mortgageable, unhealthy or damaged home is a worse outcome than requiring greater retrofitting thought or more expensive heating,\" he said.",

      "But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.",
      "Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k.",
      "The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap.",
      "Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.",
      "But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.",
      "From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:37:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Sweden has a reputation for strong gender equality, but some young women are giving up their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct5znz",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",

    "summary": "The nuclear power plant is the first to be built in the UK for 30 years.",
    "story": [
      "Workers have fitted a reactor into the first nuclear power station to be built in Britain for 30 years.",
      "Hundreds of engineers and construction staff worked for several days to lift the 500-tonne steel equipment into place at Hinkley Point C, near Bridgwater, Somerset.",
      "\"It was a huge operation for all the teams involved,\" said Matt Abbott, who led the team installing it. \"This is the heart of the plant.\"",
      "The 13m-long (42.6 ft) unit is one of two reactors which will contain the nuclear chain reaction that will generate enough power for six million homes, when it opens in 2030.",
      "The giant steel cylinder was winched up the side of the reactor building in a 12-hour operation.",
      "It then had to be manoevered along rails through a giant equipment hatch, rotated through 90 degrees and lowered carefully onto a prepared base.",
      "It will stay there for 60 years of nuclear operation, and decades beyond.",
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it \"a major step forward\".",
      "He said: \u201cGetting Hinkley up and running to produce clean power for six million homes will be a win for our long-term energy independence.\"",
      "At least 12,000 people work there, alongside more than 100 cranes. The reactor will power 25m high steam generators, and drive turbines featuring the longest blades ever made.",
      "Yet the project has been delayed by political debates, the Covid pandemic and supply chain problems.",
      "It is now due to open five years later than originally planned. The estimated cost has risen to \u00a346bn from the \u00a318bn predicted in 2017.",
      "Nonetheless, installing the reactor is a significant milestone.",
      "So how does it work, who made it, and when will they switch it on?",
      "How does it work?",
      "The reactor is known as \"the heart of Hinkley\".",
      "It will contain radioactive uranium split by nuclear fission, in a chain reaction which generates a lot of heat.",
      "Temperatures inside will average 300C. Pressure will reach 155 bar, five times more than on a submarine at normal operating depth.",
      "The steel vessel is 25cm thick, 13m (42.6 ft) long, and weighs 500 tonnes.",
      "A closed loop of pressurised water will pass round the reactor, and heat up.",
      "This heat will then be exchanged with a second loop of water, which turns into steam. The steam will drive turbines which generate Hinkley's electricity.",
      "Mr Abbott said: ''We\u2019ve got two of these reactors, and each should power about three million homes. So it\u2019s a massive deal and this is now the start of that journey for us.\"",
      "Who made it?",
      "The reactor took six years to manufacture and was made in France by a company called Framatome, which is owned by EDF, who are building Hinkley Point C.",
      "EDF is owned by the French state.",
      "Creating the reactor was a matter of \"immense pride\" for Framatome employees, according to Mathieu Gaulthier, who leads the company's team in Somerset.",
      "But why did such a central component of Britain's first new nuclear power plant for a generation have to be made abroad?",
      "\u201cThe last nuclear reactor that was built was finished in 1991,\" Ian Henderson, head of Framatome UK.",
      "\"In that time that skill base has disappeared.\"",
      "The firm is now trying to change that.",
      "At a brand new factory in Avonmouth, near Bristol, they are training high-level welders and fitters to the exacting standards of the nuclear industry.",
      "For Hinkley C, they are fabricating tanks and other structures. But on future nuclear projects, they hope to take on more sophisticated jobs.",
      "Mr Henderson explained: \"It's taken quite a few years to build those skills up to where they are today, and we want to keep that going, keep investing.\u201d",
      "When will they switch it on?",
      "In 2007 EDF's French leader Vincent de Rivaz predicted Britons would be cooking their Christmas turkeys on Hinkley power 10 years later.",
      "In fact, 2017 was the year M. de Rivaz left EDF. In Somerset, work had only just begun.",
      "As the first concrete was poured, the company said they would switch it on by 2025.",
      "But that was followed by global pandemic, a war in Ukraine and disruption to global supply chains.",
      "Now, the company expects to begin power generation by \"the end of the decade\".",

      "Its debts became more than the value of its assets, and costs related to a break-in at its Wirral plant added to its woes.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 00:20:31 GMT",
    "summary": "Demand for electric cars is lower than expected, the industry says. What might help to boost sales?",
    "story": [
      "The government is facing a backlash from car manufacturers, who claim that current rules designed to promote electric vehicles are too harsh.",
      "They say consumer demand for electric cars has fallen far short of what was expected, meaning they are struggling to sell enough.",
      "Ford insists this was a factor in its recent decision to cut 800 UK jobs.",
      "Vauxhall's owner Stellantis is to close its van-making plant in Luton - partly, it says, because of the new rules.",
      "So what could be done to encourage more consumers to buy electric?",
      "1. Subsidise the cost",
      "Electric vehicles (EVs) are generally more expensive to buy than their petrol or diesel equivalents. This is partly because they still represent a relatively small proportion of cars being built, so economies of scale \u2013 when the cost comes down the more you build \u2013 have not yet properly kicked in.",
      "The government already offers some subsidies to make EVs cheaper. They attract a low rate of company car tax, for example. Salary sacrifice schemes allow workers to lease cars cheaply through their employers, using their untaxed income, which can offer significant savings.",
      "But since the abolition of the plug-in grant for cars in 2022, there has not been a similar incentive for people who cannot get a car through their company. People within the industry believe that should change.",
      "Automotive journalist Quentin Willson, who now fronts the campaign group FairCharge, thinks the government should consider \u201cinterest free loans on used electric vehicles for lower income drivers and halve the VAT on new cars\u201d. This, he suggests, could be funded by abandoning the current freeze on fuel duty.",
      "2. Make cheaper electric cars",
      "The price of electric cars is coming down, partly due to cheaper battery packs. Despite sharp fluctuations in the value of metals used to make them, such as lithium and cobalt, battery pack prices have fallen by about 70% since 2015.",
      "This has helped reduce the price gap between electric and conventional cars. Earlier this year, Stellantis began offering the electric version of its Frontera model at the same price as the petrol hybrid model.",
      "However, that doesn\u2019t mean it is easy to find a low-budget electric car. There is a shortage of truly cheap options on the market.",
      "That is partly because a number of manufacturers have preferred to focus on more expensive and potentially more profitable models. But as Roger Atkins, founder of the Electric Vehicles Outlook consultancy, puts it, \u201ccars that cost \u00a350,000 to \u00a360,000 are not the kind of cars everyone can buy\u201d.",
      "However, change is around the corner. The Dacia Spring went on sale in the UK a few weeks ago, with a starting price of \u00a314,995. The newly launched Leapmotor T03 costs very little more, while Chinese giant BYD has said it will bring a version of its super-budget Seagull model to the UK next year.",
      "Vauxhall owner to close Luton factory",
      "Ford calls for incentives to buy electric cars as backlash grows",
      "3. Cut out the confusion",
      "The government says the sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030 \u2013 but will it?",
      "Plans to force conventional cars off the market were originally meant to take effect in 2040, under plans introduced by Theresa May's government. But the target was brought forward to 2030 under Boris Johnson, then delayed to 2035 under Rishi Sunak.",
      "People within the industry claim the changing target has sent out mixed messages and confused consumers, leading some people to delay buying an electric car until the situation becomes clearer.",
      "According to Melanie Shufflebotham, co-founder of electric charging guide Zapmap, many drivers are \u201cconfused about dates, concerned on costs and have questions about charging.\u201d She says \u201ca consistent factual communication programme\" is needed, supported by government.",
      "4. Cut VAT on public charging points",
      "Although the cost of using public charging points can vary widely depending on the provider and the charging speed you choose, public chargers are usually more expensive than charging at home.",
      "This is partly due to tax. An EV owner charging a car on their drive will pay 5% VAT on the electricity they consume. But if they use a public charger they will pay 20%. People who are unable to charge at home are left with no choice but to pay the higher rate.",
      "The industry, EV advocates and even a House of Lords committee have called for the public rate to be reduced to 5%",
      "Consultant Roger Atkins claims the current policy is \u201cdivisive\u201d, because it \u201cfavours better-off people who can charge at home on their driveways\u201d.",
      "5. Sort out the public charging network",
      "Read any survey of potential buyers\u2019 attitudes towards electric cars, and concerns about charging infrastructure will be at or near the top. People worry about whether they will be able to find a charger at a busy service station, or in a rural area.",
      "The number of charging points is growing. According to ZapMap, as of October this year, there were 71,459 charging points across the UK, at 36,060 locations. This was a 38% increase on the year before.",
      "But not everyone is happy. Complaints from existing owners struggling to find a charging point, having to queue for a long time or arriving to find it broken are not hard to find.",
      "As more EVs come onto the roads, many more charging points will be needed. The government wants 300,000 in place by 2030 \u2013 but the current rate of expansion is not fast enough to reach it.",
      "Part of the blame appears to lie with local authorities, who are responsible for granting planning permission for new rapid charging hubs. According to Roger Atkins, the process simply takes too long.",
      "Simon Smith, of charging firm Instavolt agrees that red tape is a problem. He thinks that difficulties getting grid connections for rapid charging stations is also a \"critical barrier\" to expanding the network.",
      "\"We need greater support to address planning delays, local council resistance and grid connectivity challenges\", he says."

    "published": "Sat, 30 Nov 2024 01:58:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Once restricted to only big cities, high-end specialty coffee chains are finding new customers across India.",
    "story": [
      "\"It's not just about brewing a good cup of coffee but connecting with customers on a deeper level.\"",
      "It was this one thought that made Harmanpreet Singh leave his family bakery to open a specialty coffee shop in the northern Indian city of Jalandhar.",
      "It was an unexpected decision - coffee has always been popular in southern states, traditionally served strong and frothy in a steel tumbler. But it's still not the first choice of beverage in the vast swathes of north India, where drinking tea is an intrinsic part of the culture.",
      "For Mr Singh, the journey began in 2021 during the Covid-19 pandemic when he saw a growing demand for specialty coffee, particularly among the city's youth and the overseas residents who returned to the country at that time.",
      "Recognising this shift, he moved to the southern city of Bengaluru to learn brewing techniques. \"I studied everything - from the way coffee is served to the role things like decor, cutlery, music and even packaging played in the overall experience,\" he said.",
      "Three months later, Mr Singh put his learnings to test and opened Buland Caf\u00e9 in Jalandhar.",
      "Today, the cafe has 40 outlets across the city and has become a favourite spot for the city's youth, who come here to relax or work over piping cups of coffee.",
      "The beans, roasted in various blends, are sourced from the famed coffee estates of  Karnataka. Mr Singh says he personally trained his staff on how to brew the perfect cuppa and take care of the coffee machine.",
      "\"It's a thriving scene,\" he says.",
      "Mr Singh is among a crop of young entrepreneurs that are benefitting from a wave of specialty coffee consumption in small north Indian towns and cities.",
      "India has had a vibrant cafe culture for years - but it has been largely restricted to big cities where homegrown specialty and international coffee chains dominate the market.",
      "However, post-Covid, several tier-two cities are also seeing a boom in demand for such spaces as people embrace practices like remote working and look for new places to meet their friends and families.",
      "Cafe owners say more Indians are now willing to pay more for coffee that's roasted in smaller batches and customised as per their preferences.",
      "\"Clients have become more knowledgeable about the roasts and are interested in the origins of their coffee,\" says Bharat Singhal, the founder of Billi Hu roasteries.",
      "In fact, more than 44% of the Indian population now drinks coffee, a 2023 report by CRISIL, a marketing analytical company, shows.",
      "While a lot of it comes from home consumption, the growing demand for specialty coffee in small cities plays a big part, says Bhavi Patel, a coffee consultant and dairy technologist.",
      "Roastery owners say the growth is also evident in numbers. \"Subscription based orders have surged by 50% in one year,\" says Sharang Sharma, the founder of Bloom Coffee Roasters. \"Customers have moved from French presses to pour-over or espresso machines, adopting more sophisticated brewing methods.\"",
      "While India is often associated with tea, it also has a long coffee-drinking history.",
      "The culture took shape in the 1900s when Indian Coffee Houses emerged as a hangout spot for the intellectual and elite class. Housed in colonial-styled buildings, these cafes served English breakfasts with steaming hot coffee and offered a space to discuss politics and mobilise support during pivotal periods in history.",
      "A shift occurred in the 1990s when economic reforms opened India to the world, allowing entrepreneurs to open private coffee shops frequented by young peeople, who saw it as a hip experience.",
      "Caf\u00e9 Coffee Day (CCD), which opened in 1996, quickly became one of India\u2019s most popular and widespread coffee chains. At its peak, CCD boasted over 1,700 outlets, serving as a popular gathering spot for students and young adults. But mounting debt, management issues and the untimely death of its founder led to a closure of most of its outlets across India.",
      "In 2012, the arrival of international giant Starbucks spurred the rise of homegrown specialty coffee brands like Blue Tokai Roasters, Third Wave Coffee and Subko Coffee.",
      "Mr Singhal says that while big cities like Delhi, Jaipur, Mumbai, and Bengaluru still dominate the scene, smaller cities are quickly catching up.",
      "However, it's not just changing palettes that's driving consumption. \"Often it's social media,\" Mr Singh says. \"People want good coffee but they also want to be in a space that's trendy and which they can post online.\"",
      "Nishant Sinha from Lucknow city is among those who understood the trend early on.",
      "His Roastery Coffee House offers trendy ambience, free wi-fi and cosy seating options along with an array of coffee roasts. While the beans are sourced from coffee estates in the south, the food is distinctively north Indian.",
      "Others like Jatin Khurana in the northern city of Ludhiana are experimenting with flavours.",
      "At his Urban Buhkkad cafe, Mr Khurana serves the \"Shadi Wali Coffee [the wedding coffee]\" - a wedding favourite in the 1990s, which became famous for its blend of instant coffee, milk, sugar, and a sprinkle of chocolate powder.",
      "But instead of coffee powder, Mr Khurana uses freshly grounded beans, available in different roasts and varieties, to enhance its flavours. \"The idea is to capture the essence of the beverage that many Indians grew up drinking,\" he says.",
      "It's an exciting time to be in the business - but growth comes with its own set of challenges.",
      "\"Demand is growing, but a smaller coffee shop owners tend to cut corners, whether it\u2019s by opting for substandard machines, serving weaker coffee shots, or hiring inexperienced baristas,\" Mr Singhal says.",
      "And running the business is not always profitable given the high price of coffee and the infrastructural costs involved in running such spaces.",
      "When Neha Das and Nishant Ashish opened The Eden\u2019s caf\u00e9 in Ranchi in 2021, they wanted to create a safe and relaxed space for young students to get together in the city.",
      "Today, their hazelnut coffee and cold brews have become a favourite of many.",
      "\"It took some time but longevity requires more than profit,\" Ms Das says.",
      "\"It\u2019s about dedication, crafting local flavours, and understanding customers, even if it means working with slim profit margins for the long haul.\""

    "summary": "Harrods boss manipulated and controlled managers to conceal his crimes, ex-director tells the BBC.",
    "story": [
      "Mohamed Al Fayed manipulated Harrods managers to conceal his crimes, sacking those he could not control, an ex-director has told the BBC.",
      "Jon Brilliant, who worked in Al Fayed's private office for 18 months, says the late entrepreneur plied him with envelopes full of cash - totalling about $50,000 (\u00a339,000)  - to try to compromise and control him.",
      "\u201cHe tried to own you. And ultimately, I got fired because I couldn't be bought,\u201d he says.",
      "Harrods didn't respond to Mr Brilliant's claims. It has previously said that it was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by the abuse allegations, adding that it is a \u201cvery different organisation to the one owned and controlled by Al Fayed\u201d.",
      "Mr Brilliant says he was \u201chorrified\u201d when he first heard the allegations that Al Fayed had abused hundreds of women and says he \u201cbeat himself up\u201d about whether there was anything he should have questioned more.",
      "He told the BBC about surveillance, sackings, and a culture designed to keep top managers from trusting or communicating with one another.",
      "This made it harder for them to do their duty as directors to exercise independent judgement and check Al Fayed\u2019s power - or ask questions which may have revealed more to them about how he was treating women.",
      "\u201cI 100% can see how the management structure and culture was set up to cover it up, mask it from people,\u201d says Mr Brilliant.",
      "Four other former directors have anonymously confirmed elements of this picture.",
      "A US citizen, Mr Brilliant was 36 when he joined the firm in August 2000. He was hired to relaunch the Harrods online business.",
      "He says that shortly before his first business trip to visit Microsoft in Seattle, Al Fayed gave him a brown envelope containing $5,000 (\u00a33,993) in $50 notes.",
      "After the trip he tried to return the full amount. He says Al Fayed refused, asking him, \u201cYou didn't need any entertainment?\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant replied that he did not need it - he had been too busy to visit the cinema or theatre, and someone else had paid for dinner.",
      "Receiving cash ahead of business trips - large-value notes of pounds, francs or dollars depending on his destination - continued over the following six months.",
      "Three senior colleagues suggested to Mr Brilliant at the time that Al Fayed was trying to get him to compromise himself.",
      "Mr Brilliant says they told him: \u201cHe was trying to get you to come back and say \u2018oh, I spent money on drugs or I spent money frolicking, doing something that I shouldn't have been doing,\u2019 and that he would then use that information against you if you should ever turn on him.\u201d",
      "He adds: \u201cI am certainly aware of people who... succumbed to the temptation.\u201d",
      "Mr Brilliant continued trying to return the money, until his family arrived in London and he started looking for a home. With Al Fayed\u2019s consent, he put it towards the purchase of a property.",
      "Al Fayed had form for using envelopes of cash as a tool of power and control. It had caused a scandal in the 1990s after he paid MPs to ask questions in the House of Commons - and then exposed those who had accepted his gifts.",
      "Mr Brilliant believes he was not immune to Al Fayed\u2019s extensive use of bugging and surveillance, carried out by the Harrods owner\u2019s large team of security guards.",
      "\u201cEven when I tell this story to you right now, I get kind of goosebumps and the hair stands up on the back of my neck, realising that my phones were being listened in on,\u201d he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant\u2019s first suspicion that he may have been bugged came in 2002, shortly before he was fired. After a disagreement about the funding of Fulham FC, words from a private phone conversation with someone in the US were quoted back to him in a meeting.",
      "Another former Harrods director, who wanted to remain anonymous, told us he had moved into an Al Fayed-owned property when he started at the store and one of the security team warned him it was bugged.",
      "The director says he and his wife would jokingly say \u201cgood morning\u201d to the security guards who might be listening when they woke up.",
      "He noticed that many directors kept a personal mobile phone as well as a work phone, because they feared the Harrods phone might be bugged.",
      "Mr Brilliant, who has returned to the US, says he was \u201cdumbfounded\u201d when he first heard the BBC investigation.",
      "\u201cI do look back and say, \u2018should I have seen something? Did I miss something?\u2019 And I've gone over it and over it,\u201d he says.",
      "He worked in Al Fayed\u2019s \u201cring of steel\u201d office suite on the fifth floor of Harrods, protected by two sets of security doors. There was a group of administrative assistants who were all young, blonde and attractive - he says.",
      "Mr Brilliant recalls them as \u201cobedient\u201d. He explains: \u201cThere was this notion of \u2018do this, jump, how high should I jump?\u2019 - and really being on the ball. Mohamed demanded a lot of people, and they were serving their role.\u201d",
      "He adds that he now questions whether the women acted in that way because of what may had been happening.",
      "When challenged on whether he should have done more to protect the women he says he asks himself whether he could have.",
      "\u201cI wasn't privy to that amount of information that would otherwise suggest that there was something deeper going on.\u201d",
      "'Frontal lobotomy'",
      "Mr Brilliant says Harrods\u2019 managers were set in opposition to each other and then expected to keep a watchful eye on their rivals.",
      "In addition to his core role, he was given partial oversight of a range of Al Fayed\u2019s interests, including Fulham FC and the Paris Ritz.",
      "\u201cI was asked to oversee people I had no right overseeing,\u201d says Mr Brilliant. In turn, he found that \u201cpeople were looking over my shoulder\u201d.",
      "Information was treated like a \u201ccurrency\u201d and people would jockey to share it to \u201ccurry favour\u201d with the boss, he says.",
      "This has been corroborated by an anonymous director. \u201cThere was no trust between directors,\u201d he told us. \u201cEveryone was on the defensive.\u201d",
      "In his 1997 biography of Al Fayed, journalist Tom Bower described Harrods as a \u201cmedieval court\u201d where executives\u2019 survival depended on \u201cutter loyalty\u201d and \u201ca drip of salacious gossip to sow doubts about rivals\u201d.",
      "Senior managers at Harrods were sacked with such regularity that Mr Brilliant says it was a \u201crunning joke\u201d in the store.",
      "Managers were sacked or quit so frequently that The Sunday Times began to publish a regular count, which reached 48 in 2005 - before a legal letter put a stop to it.",
      "Many dismissals ended in legal action or employment tribunals. Some were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), although Mr Brilliant was not.",
      "But some managers lasted for more than a decade. And to do that, you had to have a \u201cfrontal lobotomy\u201d said Mr Brilliant.",
      "Some, he felt, were compromised and couldn\u2019t speak out. For the others, \u201cI think you had to just do what you were told to do, do it with a smile\u2026 No original thought, no willing to challenge the status quo, just willing to accept.\u201d",
      "The BBC has tried to contact as many long-serving former Harrods directors as possible, but none were willing to give an interview.",
      "Although he only worked there for 18 months, Mr Brilliant said he wanted to speak to the BBC for two reasons.",
      "\u201cOne, if there's anything that I'm able to say or do that shows support for these women who have been horrifically treated, traumatised, I want to do whatever I can.",
      "\u201cSecondly, my hope is that by my willingness to speak out, others will come and speak out themselves.\u201d",
      "If you have information about this story that you would like to share please get in touch. Email MAFinvestigation@bbc.co.uk. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.",

      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "Yasmin - not her real name - came from Iran to study for a master\u2019s degree at a new university in the UK, but she was \"shocked\" to find many of her fellow students had limited English, and only one or two were British.",
      "\"How is it possible to continue this coursework without understanding a British accent or English properly?\" she tells BBC File on 4.",
      "Most students paid other people to do their coursework, she explains, and some would pay people to register their attendance at lectures for them.",
      "Yasmin's experience reflects a growing concern. The University and College Union (UCU) says some institutions are overlooking language skills to receive high fees from overseas students, and one professor tells us 70% of his recent master\u2019s students had inadequate English.",

      "\"You can charge a foreign student as much as they're willing to pay,\" says Ms Stephenson.",
      "Post-graduate fees are not capped either, so a master\u2019s degree at an elite university could cost \u00a350,000.",
      "Because undergraduate tuition fees for domestic students in England have not kept up with inflation, there has been a real-terms cut in university funding, says Ms Stephenson - with international students, in effect, subsidising the below-cost fees of home students.",
      "One whistleblower who worked at an education provider that prepares international students for university, told us agents would target families abroad who had the money to pay.",
      "The whistleblower - who has previously also spoken to the Sunday Times - said: \"We knew that those universities are increasingly desperate and would go along with our plans without much scrutiny into how those students were being found.",
      "\"No independent party is looking at the grades or the examinations. It's the Wild West, in a way.\"",
      "The whistleblower worked for Study Group, one of dozens of providers feeding the UK university system, and taking fees from students in the process.",
      "Based in the UK, Study Group is a registered provider which says it works for more than 50 universities with a network of 3,500 agents in 99 countries.",
      "Study Group strongly disputes the whistleblower's claims, saying overseas students earn their places on merit. It adds that any decision to admit a student on to a course is taken by the university, not Study Group, and rejects the claim that entry criteria are waived for any reason.",
      "It says courses it runs are robustly \"scrutinised by partner universities\".",
      "Yasmin paid \u00a316,000 for her course in international finance at a university in southern England. She later found out that of the 100 students on most of her modules, \"maybe 80 or 90 of them bought assignments\" from so-called \"essay mills\" based overseas. In England it is a criminal offence to complete work for a student which they can pass off as their own.",
      "When Yasmin told her tutor what was happening, he took no action. Yasmin says she now feels her master\u2019s degree has been \"devalued\".",

He tells File on 4 that 70% of his students at master\u2019s degree level over the past five years did not have sufficient English language skills to be on the course.",
      "\"There have certainly been occasions when very simple questions have not been able to be understood by students who I am teaching,\" he says.",
      "The professor told us he has had to adapt his teaching technique, and says students even use translation apps in class. But he insists fault does not lie with international students themselves, who are mostly trying their best, and says the situation varies from subject to subject.",
      "They pass, he says, because courses are often assessed through assignments, rather than exams. Some students use essay mills and pay for others to write their work or, increasingly, use artificial intelligence (AI). Both methods, he says, can defeat current anti-plagiarism software.",
      "UCU\u2019s Jo Grady says it is hardly surprising some students with poor English skills feel they need help from other people, or even use AI to do their work, as an \"act of desperation\".",
      "She says her members tell their managers that enrolling students without good English \"is a bad idea\u2026 they will struggle, and we will also struggle to teach them\". However, she says \"university managers and leaders pursue it regardless, because of the money and income it will bring in\".",
      "Some universities are in financial crisis, says Ms Grady, and have become dependent on high-fee paying overseas students who \"pay eye-watering sums of money\".",

      "She says universities carry out strict checks on those they enrol - including minimum language levels, as set by the UK government.",
      "\"Students will need to be able to afford the fee to study in the UK, but beyond that it\u2019s a question of taking students who apply, and applying a merit-based criteria,\" she says. \"It is absolutely central that this is a system that people trust.\"",
      "Ms Stern says international students are attracted by the quality of the UK's universities and says it would be \"unwise\" to rely on international income to fund domestic education and research, because overseas student numbers could be affected by geopolitics or shifts in exchange rates.",
      "Meanwhile, international student numbers are falling. Data on UK student visa applications from the first half of this year shows there has been a 16% decline in applications, resulting in a loss of income for some institutions. This drop is, in part, being attributed to changes in UK student visa rules preventing most postgraduate students from bringing dependents.",
      "It is contributing to the worst financial crisis for universities since fees were first introduced. Last month, the government regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), estimated that by 2025-26, 72% of universities could be spending more money than they have coming in, and warned that \"rapid and decisive action is necessary\".",
      "The Department for Education told the BBC a reliance on overseas students has been identified as a risk, and many universities will have to change their business models, adding that the government is committed to managing migration carefully."

      "Our rendezvous is in a large underground space and we\u2019re surrounded by three vast screens. It\u2019s fairly dark inside but the sunglasses remain in place during our conversation.",
      "I tentatively ask what they\u2019re for. Are they a shield or for something more prosaic, short-sightedness perhaps?",
      "\u201cThey help me see and they help me not see,\u201d Wintour tells me, somewhat enigmatically. \u201cThey help me be seen and not be seen. They are a prop, I would say\u201d.",

      "Wintour admits that \u201cfor someone who goes to so many shows, you get a little, not jaded, but you get used to the experience\".",
      "Since most visitors to the exhibition will not have had the chance to attend such events, she says they were keen to make sure it felt as though they were actually there.",
      "As the reigning queen of the fashion world, Wintour has had a real front-row seat for decades - often on a delicate gold chair, the kind of furniture that is ubiquitous at the high end catwalk viewings where her invitation is always a dead cert.",
      "In the blurb to the exhibition, Wintour writes that she has \u201cprobably spent a year of my life waiting for fashion shows, which are famously tardy, to begin\u201d.",
      "She tells me the American designer Marc Jacobs once held a runway show that was an hour and a half late, but \u201cwe all yelled at him so much after that, the next season, he not only started the show on time, he actually started five minutes early\u201d.",

      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",

      "Under BBC rules, presenters must reveal what they earn on an external events register, which is published by the corporation every quarter.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 13:14:06 GMT",
    "summary": "Culture editor Katie Razzall explores what the allegations against the MasterChef host mean for the corporation.",
    "story": [
      "Presenter Gregg Wallace is a national figure, who has been in people\u2019s living rooms several times a week for 20 years.",
      "His programmes, most prominently MasterChef, are made by independent production companies.",
      "But his name and face are associated with the BBC, and, as allegations continue to emerge, the corporation is under fire.",
      "It\u2019s the last thing it needs, so soon after other high profile scandals including the disgraced BBC News presenter Huw Edwards.",
      "The BBC has questions to answer about the allegations over what it knew about Wallace\u2019s behaviour on and off set, and - if it was alerted to these types of allegations - what it did about them.",
      "BBC News has been made aware of two occasions when complaints were made. One, by the radio host Aasmah Mir, related to Celebrity MasterChef in 2017.",
      "She says she complained to the production company behind the show and later spoke to the BBC\u2019s Kate Phillips who was then controller for entertainment commissioning. I understand Phillips was later assured that the issue had been addressed.",
      "Another complaint, just a year afterwards, concerned Impossible Celebrities, made by a different production company.",
      "In a letter from 2018 seen by BBC News, Phillips wrote that she had spoken to Wallace for 90 minutes to make clear what the BBC expected of him. She also confirmed in the letter that many aspects of his behaviour were unacceptable and unprofessional.",
      "Six years on, the emerging allegations about Wallace\u2019s conduct raise questions about whether executives - at the production company Banijay and the BBC - reacted appropriately.",
      "But BBC News has not been told whether the BBC executives involved in Wallace\u2019s shows were made aware of any complaints about him after 2018 and the conversation between him and Phillips. If they weren\u2019t, there is some plausible deniability that they thought the issues raised had been sorted.",
      "Then again, that defence may only go so far. There are wider questions about how much a TV executive should probe, if they are aware that rumours have begun to swirl.",
      "Popbitch, the weekly celebrity newsletter that makes its way into the inboxes of most media executives, had run stories involving allegations about Wallace\u2019s language and behaviour in the past, for example. When does the odd gossipy claim about talent misbehaviour become an issue bosses should take a look at?",
      "Should more questions have been asked by the BBC after 2018?",
      "Some have made the point that these types of scandals involving high profile TV presenters only seem to emerge when the media shines a light on them.",
      "It\u2019s only then, it is argued, that executives take action and launch an investigation. The claim is that before journalists get involved, the executives are more concerned with protecting the star, the show and their bottom line.",
      "In light of Huw Edwards, the BBC launched a workplace review into preventing abuses of power. At the time, the BBC chair Samir Shah said there \"continues to be a sense that powerful people 'get away with it'.\"",
      "But for me, how the Wallace claims may have been handled isn\u2019t entirely comparable to the Edwards scandal.",
      "Huw Edwards was employed directly by the BBC, Wallace is contracted by production companies that make his shows and sell them to the BBC.",
      "To put this in context, 326 independent companies made programmes for the BBC in the year 2023/4, accounting for 55% of the BBC\u2019s TV hours.",
      "I have picked up some frustration on the corporate side of the BBC that the corporation is taking criticism for a programme that it doesn't make.",
      "A BBC insider told me it essentially bought a product from a third party and is now being held to account for the actions of staff in a different organisation.",
      "My assessment is that if there were complaints - or claims of bad behaviour on set - the first port of call would have been the production company.",
      "But that defence - that the BBC is at arm's length on this one - only goes so far. Audiences don\u2019t make that distinction. In the end, they associate Wallace with the BBC, not a production company.",
      "The damage rests at the BBC\u2019s door.",

      "The workplace review will aim to look at how to ensure that junior people with less power feel able to speak up, when a presenter is behaving badly. The director general Tim Davie has already said he\u2019d like to ban the word \"talent\" for the BBC\u2019s stars, to help end the hierarchies that can be a part of programme making when powerful, highly paid people with audience recognition are involved.",
      "But, understandably, the review won\u2019t have oversight of the independent sector. These are independent companies responsible for their own codes.",
      "It would however be useful for the review to lay out what BBC processes are triggered when rumours begin to emerge about a particular star and what the BBC expects from its executives and indeed the production companies it buys programmes from.",
      "Philippa Childs, the head of union Bectu, told Radio 4 on Wednesday \"the time has come for the whole industry to come together and accept that there does need to be some independent scrutiny of how broadcasters [and] production companies work, to try and address this endemic problem\".",

    "story": [
      "British-Ghanaian singer Fuse ODG, who recently criticised foreign aid in Africa, has released a music video entitled We Know It\u2019s Christmas, in a rebuttal to the 40th anniversary remake of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas?",
      "The singer/rapper said his latest track is \"not just a song\" but \"a statement\".",
      "The video begins with the Grammy-winning star declaring live on ITV's Good Morning Britain programme that \"African problems need to be solved by Africans\".",
      "It follows Ed Sheeran saying last month that Band Aid had not asked for permission to re-use his vocals from a 30th anniversary version of their track. He then credited Fuse ODG, who had declined the offer to take part in the project, for updating his view of the situation.",
      "Sheeran said: \"A decade on and my understanding of the narrative associated with this has changed, eloquently explained by @fuseodg\".",
      "Fuse ODG had posted: \"I refused to participate in Band Aid because I recognised the harm initiatives like it inflict on Africa.",
      "\"While they may generate sympathy and donations, they perpetuate damaging stereotypes that stifle Africa's economic growth, tourism, and investment, ultimately costing the continent trillions and destroying its dignity, pride and identity.\"",
      "Fuse ODG won a Grammy for his collaborative work on Sheeran's 2017 song Bibia Be Ye Ye. Now his own latest music video features beautiful waterfalls and bustling cities, as well as making nods to famous black leaders including former Ghana president Kwame Nkrumah.",
      "Speaking about We Know It's Christmas (Band Aid Reply), the songwriter said it was intended as \"a reflection of where we\u2019ve come from and where we\u2019re going\".",
      "\"Ten years ago, I made a stand because I believed it was time for Africans to tell their own stories and to redefine the narrative,\" he said.",
      "\"This song is a celebration of that shift. We're no longer waiting for charity; we\u2019re building our own futures,\" he added.",
      "\"This is about empowerment, pride, and showing the world that Africa\u2019s story is far more than poverty and aid.\"",
      "The release is an audiovisual response to the latest incarnation of Do They Know It's Christmas? - a charity song first written in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money for the famine in Ethiopia.",
      "The new \"ultimate mix\" of the Band Aid single blends vocals from several versions of the charity single that have been recorded over the years, so that George Michael duets with Harry Styles, and Chris Martin harmonises with the Sugababes.",
      "Spandau Ballet singer Tony Hadley, who also sang on the original, told BBC Radio 2 that critics like Sheeran \"should shut up, to be honest.\"",
      "\"If you take that route, then nobody does anything to help anybody. So it's just nonsense...",
      "\"Everybody's doing their bit to try and support various charities and we were doing our bit, innocently, to support what was happening in Ethiopia... So what do we do? Do we sit back and do nothing?\"",
      "'Identity crisis'",
      "Speaking to the BBC Breakfast last month, Fuse ODG commented that while the original Band Aid project had been \"touching\" and well-intentioned, the lyrics and connected images were now having a damaging effect and stopping people from visiting Africa.",
      "\"It's been touching seeing the efforts that were put into it initially, the British public and different celebrities coming together to support a good cause, because there was a crisis at the time they needed attending to,\" he said.",
      "\"I have no problem with that, I think that was fantastic, and even just watching it back, I'm even getting emotional.\"",
      "\"But in that act of kindness, in that process of trying to help a crisis, we created another identity crisis,\" he continued.",
      "\"As a child who's now grown up in this era of images like that, Band Aid and initiatives like it have put Africa as a place of famine, a place of poverty, disease-filled.",
      "\"It took away our collective sense of pride and identity. So in the middle of trying to solve a temporary crisis, we've caused another dangerous crisis, which is an identity crisis for a whole continent.\"",
      "He went on to tell BBC Africa that despite having been \"excited\" initially to be invited to take part in the latest rendtion of star-studded charity track, that his over-arching \"mission\" as an artist was to \"realign how the world sees Africa and how Africans feel about themselves\".",
      "\"It hit me that the images that the Band Aid project portrays just did not align with our mission to portray Africa in a positive light.\"",
      "Speaking about the debate, Midge Ure recently acknowledged the criticisms of Band Aid's approach in the modern climate, saying it was \"unfortunate\" that Sheeran had not been contacted about the 2024 mix.",
      "\"I understand the whole thing about the 'white saviour complex',\" he told Radio 2's Jeremy Vine. \"It's not new. We've had this thrown at us for 40 years.\"",
      "However, he said the song was not about portraying Africa in a negative light, but was trying to show the real-life consequences \"of famine, of war, of conflict\".",
      "\"And the result is children who need food, who need medication, who need education, and that's what we deal with.\"",
      "Fuse ODG noted: \"There's also starving children in the UK.\u201d",

    "summary": "Paul McCartney says their success may have been the US needing a lift \"out of sorrow\", but is he right?",
    "story": [
      "In Beatles '64, the new documentary which charts the impact of the band's first US tour and how it catapulted them to global superstardom, Paul McCartney makes a suggestion as to why they achieved so much so quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen we came, it was quite shortly after Kennedy had been assassinated,\" he said.",
      "\"Maybe America needed something like The Beatles to be lifted out of sorrow.\"",
      "Beatles scholars and cultural historians have long remarked upon how much of a lift the band gave to an America in mourning.",
      "But was McCartney right? Was the rise of the world's most famous band partly down to the murder of the 35th president of the United States?",
      "Did The Beatles crack America because Kennedy was killed?",
      "'Unstoppable force'",
      "When The Beatles landed at the recently-renamed John F. Kennedy International Airport on 7 February 1964, it was just 70 days after the the 46-year-old Democrat had been murdered.",
      "Kennedy was shot as his motorcade drove through Dallas, Texas, on 22 November 1963 and his death threw his country into a period of mourning.",
      "Dr Patrick Andelic, assistant professor of American History at Northumbria University, said it was a moment that shook the nation to its core, partially because of JFK's own pop culture persona.",
      "\"In a sense, Kennedy was the first TV president, which was relatively new at this point,\" he said.",
      "\"By the beginning of the '60s, 90% of American families had TVs, so the way news and media was consumed totally changed.\"",
      "He said the president was, like The Beatles, \"young, handsome, witty and energetic, which translated really well to TV\".",
      "\"He embraced television and was well suited to it,\" he said.",
      "\"And that makes the shock and trauma of his death sharper in the aftermath.",
      "\"It was the first killing of a sitting president in 60 years.\"",
      "It was, of course, TV which also helped The Beatles become a phenomenon in their homeland.",
      "Settling on their now final line-up of Paul McCartney, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr in 1962, the Liverpool four-piece had already scored two number one albums in 1963 with Please Please Me and With The Beatles.",
      "When that success was coupled with the famous 1963 Royal Variety Performance appearance during which Lennon asked \"the people in the cheaper seats to clap their hands\" and the rest to just \"rattle their jewellery\" they became a national sensation.",
      "Senior music industries lecturer Dr Holly Tessler, from the University of Liverpool, said it was that show that \"made them stars overnight\".",
      "\"At this point, The Beatles were an unstoppable force in the UK,\" she said.",
      "Fear of failure",
      "The Beatles' youthful exuberance was central to their success, chiming with the legions of British teenagers that had begun to follow them.",
      "Dr Andelic said in America, JFK had a similar appeal.",
      "\"Kennedy projected youth and vitality and in his inaugural address, he spoke of the torch being passed to a new generation of Americans,\" he said.",
      "\"His death cut that short in a shocking way.\"",
      "He said in the aftermath, the nation started \"to look for more positive things, stability and reassurance\".",
      "\"When The Beatles arrive, I think they represented that.",
      "\"They were also young, vital, and [in the footage] of them getting off the plane, they were being silly.",
      "\"So, for a nation shattered by a trauma, The Beatles represented an opportunity to laugh and have fun again.\"",
      "Winning over a portion of America's youth was one thing, but cracking the national market was another.",
      "Many British acts had tried and failed to mirror the transatlantic appeal of their US counterparts, who had seen great chart success in the UK, and crack the American market.",
      "There had been limited success for those that came before The Beatles.",
      "Lonnie Donegan, the titular \"King of Skiffle\", had two top ten hits, while Cliff Richard, then the biggest act in Britain, had only made it into the US top 40 on one occasion.",
      "Spencer Leigh, author of many books on The Beatles, said the trend of British acts failing to \"make it\" in the United States, had seen Capitol, one of the country's biggest record companies, even refuse to distribute The Beatles' music for fear of the same result.",
      "\"Artists from the UK didn't sell well in America and it seemed Capitol looked down its nose at the British work,\" he said.",
      "Capitol's concerns were understandable. The singles Please Please Me, From Me To You and She Loves You had all been released in the US in 1963 and seen limited success, so they were reluctant to put out I Want To Hold Your Hand.",
      "The band's manager Brian Epstein and Capitol's parent company EMI managed to change the label's minds and on Boxing Day 1963, about a month after Kennedy's assassination, the single hit America's stores.",
      "Its impact was huge and by the first week of February, it was at the top of the US charts, a position it would hold for seven weeks.",
      "The success meant more than 3,000 fans and a large press pack were at the airport when the band touched down.",
      "For Spencer Leigh, it was what came next, not what had happened before, that led to their global success.",
      "\"My view is the people screaming for The Beatles at the airport were young and didn't know much about politics,\" he said.",
      "\"For me, the turning point was the Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "'Fleeting at best'",
      "At 20:00 on 9 February 1964, The Beatles made the first of three appearances on the programme, which was one of America's most popular TV variety shows.",
      "The TV channel CBS reportedly received more than 50,000 requests for seats at its 700-capacity studio ahead of the band's visit and those who failed to get their hands on any huddled excitedly around TVs at home.",
      "\"More than 70 million people watched the first one and they performed so well,\" Leigh said.",
      "He said one of the moments that really caught the audience's attention was when cameras panned to each band member, flashing their names on the screen.",
      "\"They put a caption on John Lennon saying 'sorry girls he's married',\" he said.",
      "\"I'm not sure how much [the band] appreciated that.\"",
      "About a month after those first three performances, The Beatles made US chart history by becoming the first act to hold the top five slots simultaneously.",
      "Beatlemania had now gone global and the rest was history.",
      "For Dr Tessler, the notion that America went down with the death of JFK and back up with the arrival of The Beatles is too simplistic.",
      "For her too, it was the Ed Sullivan Show appearances, rather than the assassination aftermath that set The Beatles on the road to pop immortality.",
      "\"I really struggle with the idea that The Beatles owe their US success to JFK being shot,\" she said.",
      "\"Their manager Brian Epstein had already been to America and done the deal to get them on the Sullivan show weeks before Kennedy was killed, and there was so much hype when the band finally landed in the US.",
      "\"America might have wanted a distraction from that feeling of 'what's next' after the assassination, but The Beatles became the story so quickly that the connection to Kennedy was only fleeting at best.\"",

      "\u201cI'm really proud that I took this idea that was made up in this movie - that I was really sexy - and used it to fight a disease where people were getting punished for their sexuality, because I was getting punished for mine,\" she says.",

      "Her artworks are bold and impressionistic, and - in her own words - \u201cvery large\u201d. This, she explains, is partly because she was inspired by an aunt who painted murals on the walls of her house - and partly because she can\u2019t see well enough to paint small.",
      "She says she doesn\u2019t envisage what the final creation will look like as she paints. \u201cI'm just in it so deeply,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's so immersive. It's just wonderful.\u201d",
      "We also talk about online dating - because yes, Hollywood icon and superstar Sharon Stone has been using dating apps, like so many other people trying to find love. She was even temporarily blocked from Bumble after other users thought her profile was fake.",

      "She says she wasn\u2019t convinced by the actions of some of the characters she played. But now, she says: \u201cI think we're getting to a place where women are just playing how a women would actually behave in the circumstance.\u201d",

      "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) final draft guidance on Mounjaro has recommended it starts being given from March, alongside advice on diet and exercise.",
      "It will be offered to people with a body mass index (BMI) of more than 35 and at least one obesity-related health problem - potentially 3.4 million people.",
      "But because of concerns it could overwhelm services, and in particular GPs, NICE has agreed to give the NHS more than a decade to introduce it - an unprecedented move for a medication.",
      "Weight loss injections: How do drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro work?",
      "NICE chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Benger acknowledged it would mean \u201cmany people would have to wait\u201d.",
      "But he said: \u201cWe\u2019ve had to make this difficult decision in order to protect vital NHS services and also to test ways of delivering this new generation of weight-loss medications.\u201d",
      "Patient groups have expressed disappointment at the decision to give the NHS so long.",
      "Questions remain",
      "Only those patients under the care of specialist weight-management services will be offered it initially \u2013 matching the approach taken with a similar weight-loss drug, Wegovy.",
      "But from June, the NHS will start offering it to others.",
      "It is unclear exactly how this will be done \u2013 GP practices are likely to be in charge of referring patients, but questions remain over who will be providing the ongoing support involving diet and exercise and monitoring.",
      "NHS England is expected to publish guidance on this in the new year. It could involve the use of apps or separate services being established to support GPs.",
      "Mounjaro, or tirzepatide, which is made by Eli Lilly, makes you feel fuller so you eat less. In trials, people on it have lost a fifth of their body weight.",
      "Wegovy, also known as semaglutide, which is already available on the NHS, works in a similar way. But that can only be given to those under the care of specialist weight-loss management.",
      "There are around 40,000 people estimated to be in that position.",
      "The drugs can be bought privately. Both medicines are also already available for people with type 2 diabetes \u2013 although semaglutide is marketed as Ozempic for those patients.",
      "The rollout of Mounjaro opens up the option of this new generation of weight-loss drugs to the wider public who are struggling with severe obesity.",
      "To be eligible, patients will also need to have one obesity-related condition, such as diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.",
      "Under the rollout plans, those with the highest clinical need will be prioritised first.",
      "It is estimated around 250,000 will benefit in the first three years.",
      "NICE then plans to evaluate how that is working, before pushing ahead with the wider rollout.",
      "As this is final draft guidance, it is still possible rollout could be delayed if there are any appeals made against the decision. If there is not, the guidance will be rubber-stamped before Christmas, NICE said.",
      "Concerns",
      "Mounjaro, which is given via weekly injections, will cost the NHS \u00a3122 per patient per month, but NICE judged it to be cost-effective given the cost of obesity.",
      "There is a risk that users can put weight back on once they stop using it.",
      "Ministers in Wales will be using the guidance from NICE to inform their rollout.",
      "It is already recommended for use in Scotland \u2013 although the NHS is reportedly struggling with its rollout.",
      "Helen Kirrane, of Diabetes UK, said Mounjaro had a \u201csignificant\u201d role to play in tackling obesity.",

      "Dr Kath McCullough, NHS England\u2019s national specialty adviser for obesity, said weight-loss drugs were an \u201cimportant tool\u201d to help tackle \u201cone of the greatest public health issues facing the NHS\u201d.",
      "She said the phased rollout was needed to protect access to other NHS services that patients rely on.",

It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",

Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",

      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",

      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

      "They are not perhaps the most elegant duo of words, but they get to the heart of what the prime minister wants to set out in a wide-ranging speech on Thursday -  what senior folk in government describe as \u201cmeasurable deliverables\".",
      "In other words, Sir Keir Starmer's \"plan for change\" to be revealed later will include half a dozen understandable, digestible promises and a deadline - the next general election.",

      "Three milestones are for England - more housebuilding and planning reform, speeding up how long it takes to get a routine NHS operation, and improving pre-school education. There will also be a greener energy target for the UK and for putting more police on the beat in England and Wales.",

      "We don\u2019t know what all the targets will be. But BBC Verify has looked at the six key areas Starmer is expected to focus on and assessed what the government has already pledged to do, as well as how likely it is to achieve these goals.",
      "The NHS",
      "The NHS in England has an official target that 92% of patients waiting for planned treatment should be seen within 18 weeks of being referred.",
      "Labour's manifesto pledged this and the government is expected to commit to doing so by 2029.",

      "And to help fund this, Chancellor Rachel Reeves increased the inflation-adjusted day-to-day cash resources of the health department by 3.8% in both 2024-25 and 2025-26 in her Autumn Budget.",
      "However, Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents managers, has warned that achieving the 40,000 appointments and operations target will not be enough, on its own, to hit the broader 92% waiting list target.",
      "\u201cThe NHS needs reform, not just ever more activity,\u201d Mr Taylor said.",
      "The economy",
      "Labour is expected to make a new pledge to increase the amount of money that households have.",
      "In October, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which does the government's forecasts, predicted that real household disposable income (RHDI) per person would rise by around 0.5% per year over this Parliament.",
      "According to calculations by the Resolution Foundation, a think tank focused on living standards, that would be a slightly better performance than the 0.3% average growth in RHDI per person in the previous Parliament.",
      "But it would be worse than every other Parliament for decades.",
      "In its manifesto, Labour pledged to \"secure the highest sustained growth in the G7\u201d: that means the UK, the US, Canada, Italy, France, Japan and Germany.",
      "The latest forecasts from the IMF from October suggest that Canada and the US will have stronger average growth than the UK between 2024 and 2029.",
      "However, it should be stressed that these are only forecasts - and forecasts related to economic growth and incomes are subject to considerable uncertainty.",
      "Crime",
      "We do know that the government will re-commit to its manifesto pledge to hire 13,000 additional neighbourhood police officers, special constables and Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs), who work with officers but do not have all the same powers.",

      "But she also warned that morale in the force is low due to real terms pay cuts in recent years and pointed out that in the federation's last survey 22% of respondents said they were planning to leave within the next two years.",
      "Education",
      "The government is expected to pledge to raise the proportion of children in England who are \u201cready for school\u201d at the age of five, to 75%.",
      "Official data from the Department for Education suggests that in 2023-24, 67.7% of children in England had a \u201cgood level of development\u201d.",
      "This is based on teacher assessments of children\u2019s development at age five.",
      "This was up slightly from 67.2% in the previous year.",
      "The government is in the middle of a major expansion of state-funded childcare.",
      "From September 2025, the government is pledging to deliver 30 hours of government funded childcare a week for under-fives in England, taking on the commitment of the previous government.",
      "However, the Early Years Alliance, which represents nurseries in England, estimates that the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Budget will result in additional annual costs averaging more than \u00a318,600 per provider. That is based on a survey of its members.",
      "The childcare sector warns that, without extra funding to make up for the tax rise, nurseries might withdraw from the free childcare scheme, or some could go out of business.",
      "Housebuilding",
      "Also in line with Labour\u2019s manifesto, Starmer is expected to recommit to building 1.5 million net additional dwellings in England over the course of the Parliament.",
      "At a constant annual rate, that would equate to 300,000 per year,",
      "The most recent official data shows that 221,070 net additional dwellings were delivered in 2023-24, a decline of 6% on the previous year.",
      "The government is bringing in new housing targets for local councils in England, which the previous administration dropped and is reforming planning laws to try to accelerate building.",
      "But many housing experts remain sceptical about the feasibility of Labour\u2019s target given the lack of affordability of new housing, which has put off many buyers and deterred private developers from investing.",
      "Official data also shows that the number of housing projects given the go-ahead by councils in England reached a record low in the final months of the last government, mainly because of a decline in applications from builders.",
      "Clean power",
      "As part of its commitment to substantially decarbonise the UK\u2019s electricity grid by 2030, the government is expected to pledge, in line with its manifesto, to triple the UK\u2019s solar power capacity, double onshore wind capacity and quadruple offshore wind capacity.",

      "He said it illustrated the importance of having reserves in order to be able to fight in a \"war of scale\".",

      "In a speech on reserves at the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank in London, Carns, the minister for veterans and people, said: \"That doesn't mean to say we need a bigger army, but it does mean we must be able to generate depth and mass rapidly in the event of a crisis.",
      "\"The reserves are critical, absolutely central, to that process.",

      "Admiral Sir Tony Radakin added that Russia \"knows the response would be overwhelming, whether conventional or nuclear\".",

      "Carns said the reality of wars such as the one being fought in Ukraine was that they were \"attritional in nature\".",

    "summary": "Scrapping the two-child cap and changes to tax thresholds are among plans for the next financial year.",
    "story": [
      "A vow to scrap the two-child benefit cap and changes to basic and intermediate tax thresholds are among the plans for the Scottish government for the next financial year.",
      "The announcements were made by Finance Secretary Shona Robison as she revealed her tax and spending plans for 2025/26.",
      "Other talking points included an extra \u00a32bn for the NHS and a \u00a3768m investment in affordable homes.",
      "Here are five key takeaways from this year's Scottish Budget.",
      "Two-child benefits cap",
      "The biggest announcement in the budget actually isn\u2019t part of the tax or spending plans for next year.",
      "It was Shona Robison\u2019s \u201crabbit out of the hat\u201d moment of announcing that the Scottish government would move to scrap - or offset, or mitigate - the two-child benefits cap.",
      "That\u2019s a UK-wide policy, imposed by the Department of Work and Pensions on welfare payments such as universal credit and child tax credits - so it will take some time, and will need some help from the UK government.",
      "It\u2019s not yet clear what the mechanism will be, how it will work, or how much it will cost.",
      "The Scottish Fiscal Commission says it was only sent the proposal last week, and that it hasn\u2019t had time to cost it; they call it a \u201cfiscal risk\u201d.",
      "But be in no doubt that this is a big challenge to Labour.",
      "It comes days after an announcement on the winter fuel payment also designed to outflank Anas Sarwar\u2019s party and embarrass the UK administration.",
      "If all goes to plan then the SNP government will start sending out payments to families of the 15,000 children affected in April 2026. One month before the next Holyrood election.",
      "Labour says it's willing to listen to ideas, but points out that there is not a penny in the coming year\u2019s budget to support it.",
      "They will surely need to come up with a more substantial response before that election comes much closer.",
      "Taxes",
      "There were no big changes to the devolved income tax system in this budget.",
      "There was some tinkering with thresholds, which will have a political impact if not a big financial one.",
      "Robison is increasing the thresholds for the basic and intermediate rates - two of the lower rungs in Scotland\u2019s six-band ladder of taxes.",
      "Because Chancellor Rachel Reeves has frozen those thresholds in the rest of the UK, it means Scots earning less than \u00a330,300 will pay less tax than if they lived in England or Wales.",
      "The difference is less than \u00a330 a year, but it allows Robison to say that 51% of Scottish taxpayers pay less.",
      "One bill that will almost certainly be going up is council tax. But with last year\u2019s one-off freeze on local rates coming to an end, it will be down to your local representatives to decide.",
      "Rather than wielding a stick by imposing any sort of cap, Robison instead sought to guilt local authorities into holding down increases, saying that \u201cwith record funding there is no reason for big increases in council tax next year\u201d.",
      "She says there\u2019s an extra \u00a31bn for local government - but it remains to be seen how much of that councillors will be free to allocate, and how much will fall into ring-fenced areas.",
      "Every year the government says it has increased funding for councils, then councils hit back that it\u2019s not enough, and there\u2019s a row over exactly how much money is enough money.",
      "We will no doubt go around in circles on that until budgets at a local and national level are finalised next year.",
      "Spending priorities",
      "The budget totalled more than \u00a363bn, and previously ubiquitous talk of tough decisions and austerity was notably absent. There was a positive tone - like Robison suddenly had some cash to splash on the government\u2019s favourite policies.",
      "John Swinney has made the eradication of child poverty as his top priority, and as ever there is cash in the budget for the flagship Scottish Child Payment.",
      "The cash to mitigate the two-child cap doesn\u2019t feature in this budget - only some money to set up that system, whatever it turns out to look like.",
      "In total, spending on social security is up by \u00a3800m - highlighting a key feature of devolved government, in the SNP\u2019s appetite for big state interventions and welfare safety nets.",
      "You can include in that last week\u2019s announcement about winter fuel payments, which are being partially reinstated from next year.",
      "This week Mr Swinney has also (unsurprisingly) earmarked the NHS as a core priority, and as expected it has a record funding settlement - \u00a321bn, or a third of the total budget.",
      "That includes almost \u00a3200m to cut waiting times and cash for local hospital projects in Edinburgh, Fort William and Airdrie.",
      "There were also billions of pounds for net zero and climate policies - including money from the ScotWind fund, a pot of cash raised by auctioning off plots of the seabed for offshore wind, which Robison had previously feared she might need to use for day-to-day funding.",
      "And there is \u00a3768m for affordable housing, which chiefly goes to reverse a cut made under Humza Yousaf\u2019s administration last year, but does ultimately leave spending higher and will apparently create 8,000 new homes in the coming year.",
      "Growing the economy",
      "A big focus of governments across the UK has been economic growth. Rachel Reeves has put it at the core of everything she is doing as chancellor, as Robison said a thriving economy was \u201can essential requirement\u201d.",
      "The finance secretary had been challenged to match the chancellor\u2019s support for firms in the retail, leisure and hospitality sectors - a 40% relief on business rates.",
      "Scotland has a slightly different system of \u201cnon-domestic rates\u201d, but ultimately Robison said there would be a similar 40% relief for the vast majority of hospitality premises.",
      "Retail and leisure were notably absent (although there is some support for music venues), and we will see how far this shakes out in terms of who does and doesn\u2019t qualify for funding.",
      "The Scottish Hospitality Group has said it is a \u201csignificantly more restricted\u201d offer than that down south, calling it a \u201cdrop in the ocean\u201d.",
      "A motif of Ms Robison\u2019s speech was name-checking her cabinet colleagues as she spoke to each of their portfolio areas.",
      "That felt particularly notable in the case of Kate Forbes - an influential figure as the woman John Swinney brought into government in part to mend fences with business.",
      "She has highlighted more money for town centre regeneration as well as a tripling of investment in the offshore wind supply chain, which it is said will leverage ten times that figure in private investment.",
      "This approach of public cash opening the door to huge flows of private funds is a favourite tactic of Ms Reeves - and indeed is the core purpose of GB Energy.",
      "That UK energy firm is set to have some company when it sets up in Aberdeen, with Ms Robison pledging to establish a hub or offshore wind in the North East.",
      "Politics",
      "The SNP does not have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, and thus needs the help of other parties to pass a budget.",
      "John Swinney has talked about wanting to reach out to opponents and run a collaborative administration.",
      "But there is no chance of a deal with the Conservatives, who want a billion pounds of tax cuts, or Labour, who really just want an election.",
      "That leaves the Greens and the Lib Dems as the most likely dance partners.",
      "Robison quite deliberately nodded to the key asks of both parties. There was funding for ferries, mental health and dentistry for the Lib Dems. The Greens demanded \u00a34.7bn for green policies - and she pledged \u00a34.9bn.",
      "The Greens welcomed some of the measures, but said \u201csignificant further changes\u201d were needed. They are particularly suspicious of the sums on offer for councils.",
      "The Lib Dems welcomed even more of Robison\u2019s announcements, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton reeling off a whole series of measures where he said it was right the government had listened to him.",
      "The draft budget is really the starting point for talks, which won\u2019t come to a head until the first votes at Holyrood in February.",

    "story": [
      "Councils in England facing soaring homelessness costs are urging the government to foot more of the bill, the BBC can reveal.",
      "Local authorities which house people in temporary accommodation generally pay the up-front costs and claim the cash back from central government.",

      "\"So it's getting increasingly expensive in a constrained market to find places that are suitable for people to live at costs that councils can afford.\"",
      "That lack of available accommodation options has meant many councils have had to use more expensive options, such as hotels and bed and breakfasts, to house those in need.",
      "Official government data released last week showed a record 123,100 households were in temporary accommodation at the end of June, a 16% rise on last year.",
      "Matt Downie, chief executive of homelessness charity Crisis, told the BBC: \u201cAs more and more people are pushed into homelessness due to rising living costs and sky-high rents, they have nowhere else to go but to their local council, who too often have nowhere to put them but into expensive temporary accommodation that is often unfit for their needs.\u201d",

      "But the coalition government froze that cap based on 2011 rates and no government has since unfrozen it.",
      "\u201c[Then-Chancellor] George Osborne and his gang decided to pass the buck to local authorities, and try and bear down on the benefits bill at the cost of many other things,\u201d said Hug, who is also the Labour leader of Westminster City Council.",

      "They fear the algorithm used to calculate the targets has not taken into account strains on local infrastructure, land shortages, and a lack of capacity in the planning system and construction industry.",
      "The concerns are shared by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat authorities, according to BBC analysis of 90% of the consultation responses.",
      "Asked whether the government would force councils to meet the targets, Rayner said: \"We are saying that they\u2019re mandatory targets...",

      "\"I often get described as left school at 16 without any qualifications, and there\u2019s so much more to me than being a woman or being working class.\"",
      "Asked if she would still be able to achieve what she has if she was a young person today in the face of struggling public services, stagnating wages and cost-of-living pressures, Rayner acknowledged it would be \"a challenge\" and \"you have to have a bit of luck\".",
      "But she said the government wanted to invest in state education \"so that people have those opportunities that I had\".",

      "About one in five women aged 16 and over in England and Wales have been a victim of stalking at least once, official figures show.",
      "The government said it had worked with broadcaster and activist Nicola Thorp, whose stalker is serving a 30-month jail sentence, in developing the new protections.",
      "Ms Thorp had been unable to find out the identity of her stalker until he appeared in court.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Thorp said the \"right to know\" would have been crucial in relieving the \"psychological impact\" of her experience.",
      "\"Well-meaning police officers felt worried they were going to breach this guy's right to anonymity and GDPR - so he had his identity protected. I felt like a sitting duck - and I started to suspect everybody\".",
      "\"It would have given me some form of power back in my life to know who this man was - but more importantly, who he wasn't,\" she added.",
      "Under the new measures, Stalking Protection Orders - which can ban alleged stalkers from contacting or being within a certain distance of their victims - will be made more widely available, the government said.",
      "The changed approach will see courts able to impose these orders after a conviction even when one was not in place before a criminal trial, in a change to the current system - where one needs to have been issued beforehand.",
      "Offenders will also be prevented from contacting their victims from behind bars, the Home Office said.",
      "If an accused person is acquitted, courts will still be able to apply protection orders on them if there is sufficient evidence indicating they still pose a risk to someone.",

      "Stalking victims failed by police, report finds",
      "Stalking super-complaint launched against police",
      "Phillips, who has been a victim of stalking, added the proposals aims to help people \"feel safe in their environment\".",

      "The independent victims' commissioner for London, Claire Waxman, welcomed the changes - saying the criminal justice system had \"struggled to deal robustly with stalking, leaving \"offenders undeterred and victims at risk\" for too long.",
      "A spokesperson for charity Action Against Stalking said removing anonymity from stalkers means individuals will be held accountable for their \"harmful behaviour\".",
      "\"Victims often feel powerless when their abuser remains anonymous, which can exacerbate feelings of fear and vulnerability,\" said the charity, which is based in Scotland but works across the whole of the UK.",
      "But they said while the proposed measures represent a step in the right direction, their effectiveness will depend on implementation.",
      "\"Adequate resources must be allocated to law enforcement, the criminal justice system, and victim support services. Equally important is public education to reduce stigma and ensure victims feel safe coming forward,\" they added.",

      "A deal that could see the Parthenon Sculptures returned to Greece is \"close\", a former adviser to the country's government has told the BBC.",
      "Prof Irene Stamatoudi said it \"seems negotiations have gone forward\" over relocating the antiquities - also known as the Elgin Marbles - which were taken from Athens more than 200 years ago and are displayed in the British Museum.",
      "It came as Sir Keir Starmer and his Greek counterpart met for talks in Downing Street on Tuesday - though it is unclear whether the Elgin Marbles were discussed.",
      "An official account of the meeting released by No 10 made no mention of it, though Greek's public broadcaster ERT claimed it had been raised in the talks.",
      "A Downing Street spokesperson refused to be drawn over whether or not it had been discussed, saying only: \u201cUnderstandably, the Greek Prime Minister would have raised many issues but... their discussion focused on areas of shared cooperation.\u201d",

    "summary": "Immigration, both legal and illegal, via small boat crossings in the Channel, has ballooned in recent years.",
    "story": [
      "Of all of this new government\u2019s big promises, getting economic growth up and immigration down are the two biggies \u2013 and their early months in office show just how hard achieving either, let alone both, will be.",
      "Economic growth has been stuttery and half-hearted for ages.",
      "And immigration, both legal and illegal, via small boat crossings, has ballooned in recent years.",
      "Now, Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have reached a milestone with a big number attached.",
      "Over the weekend, the number of people who have arrived on small boats since the general election in July exceeded 20,000.",
      "Privately, ministers acknowledge that successfully tackling irregular, illegal migration is absolutely key to how competent or otherwise the government is perceived to be; however fair or otherwise that might be, given the scale of the challenge.",

      "How many people cross the Channel in small boats?",
      "Could Labour 'stop the boats'?",
      "Those pictures of dinghies bobbing around in the Channel are hugely powerful: they represent a geopolitical, diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and political issue all rolled into one.",
      "For some it can be described more bluntly: people breaking into the country, with those with the job of stopping it failing.",
      "As Nick Robinson sets out here after a week of reporting on this for the Today Programme on Radio 4, the huge amount of people desperate to reach the UK and other countries like it is not likely to shrink significantly.",
      "And so the political argument revolves around what can be done to put people off trying.",
      "One thing that does put people off, but politicians have no control over, is the weather.",
      "The boats that are used are incredibly flimsy for a sea journey. I have seen and touched them, when visiting Border Force in Dover. They are made of the same stuff as a bouncy castle.",
      "So it is not surprising that when the weather isn\u2019t great, and in particular when there are plenty of waves, fewer crossings are attempted.",
      "The Home Office classifies each day according to the weather, with those judged to have the most benign conditions on the water called 'red days'.",
      "Between mid October and mid November this year, there was the highest concentration of so-called red days in any month since the big uptick in small boat crossings in 2021.",
      "Of the 31 days between those dates, 26 fell into that category and 6,288 people crossed the  Channel.",
      "In the same period last year there were three red days and 768 arrivals.",
      "But expect to see the Conservatives brand this as a \u2018dog ate my homework excuse\u2019 or words to that effect.",
      "They will argue that the abandonment of the previous government\u2019s plan to send some migrants to Rwanda has meant the removal of a crucial deterrent to potential crossings.",
      "When Yvette Cooper and the shadow home secretary Chris Philp debate this in the Commons on Monday afternoon, we can expect the Rwanda policy to be a big part of the conversation.",
      "Cooper will attempt to, at least, partially itemise where the \u00a3700m spent on the idea went.",
      "She will claim that the cost of the four people who volunteered to go to Rwanda was the equivalent of the total cost of the state education of a single child in England.",
      "The home secretary will instead claim that focused on what is described as the \u2018upstream problem\u2019 \u2013 where smuggling gangs initially recruit people to make the long journeys to the West \u2013 is key.",
      "Last week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.",
      "Philp is expected to argue this deal is thin and the financial commitment is comparable with resurfacing a local road rather than the basis for a game-changing solution.",
      "Many of the arguments will be familiar as will the grapple for plausible, workable solutions - which were out of the grasp of the last government and, while it is early days, appear out of the grasp of the new one too."

    "story": [
      "Sir Keir Starmer has appointed Sir Chris Wormald as his Cabinet Secretary - the head of the civil service and one of the most powerful jobs in government.",
      "Announcing the appointment, the prime minister said he wanted a \"complete re-wiring of the British state\" and that there was \"no-one better placed\" to do that than Sir Chris.",
      "As someone who has worked for the civil service since the early 1990s, Sir Chris has plenty of civil service experience.",
      "Depending on your perspective that either makes him an ideal candidate who understands how to fix the system's problems or an establishment figure, wedded to the status quo.",
      "His appointment was greeted with delight by Lord Jim Bethell, a former health minister who worked with Sir Chris during the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"When the killer zombies invade, I'd like Chris Wormald at my back,\" he posted on social media.",
      "Ex-health secretary Sajid Javid described Sir Chris as \"brilliant and dedicated\" while another former health secretary, Matt Hancock, said he was a \"natural reformer\" who knew \"where the bear-traps are\".",
      "However, another former colleague has been less complimentary.",
      "Dominic Cummings, a senior No 10 adviser during the pandemic, said: \"Today should be a wake-up call to all investors in UK and young talent.",
      "\"The Westminster system is totally determined to resist any change and will continue all the things of the past 20 years that have driven us into crisis.\"",
      "Chris Wormald to become new civil service head",
      "Cabinet Secretary to step down on health grounds",
      "What is the UK Covid inquiry and how does it work?",
      "In May 2016, Sir Chris became the most senior civil servant in the Department of Health and over the next eight years worked with no fewer than seven different secretaries of state from Conservative Jeremy Hunt through to Labour\u2019s Wes Streeting.",
      "In that role, he oversaw important policies and decisions made after Covid emerged. And also \u2013 crucially \u2013 in the years before the virus started spreading, when planning for a pandemic was meant to be taking place.",
      "He has already given evidence on three separate occasions to the public inquiry into the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.",
      "Following one of his evidence sessions, one lawyer for the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice group accused him of providing \"an object lesson in obfuscation, a word salad, so many, many words, so very little substance\".",
      "In November 2023, the Covid inquiry published text messages he exchanged with his then-boss, Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill.",
      "These were sent on 12 March 2020, less than two weeks before the country entered its first national lockdown.",
      "In the messages, Lord Sedwill wrote: \u201cPresumably like chickenpox we want people to get it and develop herd immunity before the next wave. We just want them not to get it all at once and preferably when it\u2019s warm and dry.\u201d",
      "Sir Chris replied: \u201cExactly right. We make the point every meeting, they don\u2019t quite get it.\"",
      "Around that time, the government was forced to deny it had a plan to develop so-called herd immunity by accepting that younger, fitter people would catch the virus.",
      "Asked about this at the time, Sir Chris accepted he had been \u201cvery, very loose\u201d in his language but was, in reality, following scientific advice.",
      "Writing on X following Sir Chris's appointment on Monday, Cummings was fiercely critical of his role at the time.",
      "\u201cMany officials came to me in panic when they realised the cabinet secretary and permanent secretary of the health department in charge of pandemic planning truly believed that the faster everyone got Covid, the better,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cHe is now in charge of the entire system. Plan accordingly!\u201d",
      "Cummings also accused Sir Chris of being \u201cembedded deeply\u201d in the infected blood scandal and repeatedly telling ministers \u201cuntruths about the documents\u201d.",
      "In 2018 Sir Chris did write letters of apology after it emerged two former health ministers were incorrectly told all documents linked to infected blood had been placed in the National Archives, when campaigners later established that was not the case.",
      "Three years later, in 2021, Sir Chris then recused himself from any decisions related to the scandal.",
      "It later emerged that his father Peter, who was himself a Department of Health official from 1978 to 1981, was involved in meetings and decisions related to Britain\u2019s Blood Products Laboratory and had provided written evidence to the infected blood inquiry.",
      "Sir Chris was born in London in 1968 and went to Rutlish School in Merton, the same school former Prime Minister Sir John Major had gone to over 20 years earlier.",
      "He studied at St John's College, Oxford and on graduating almost immediately joined the civil service, starting out as a fast stream trainee in the Department for Education.",
      "Over the next 20 years he rose through the ranks, serving across Whitehall including at the Department for Communities and Local Government and in the office of the then-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg.",
      "Now at the pinnacle of his career, it had been widely-known that Sir Chris was on the final shortlist to be the prime minister's new cabinet secretary, alongside Antonia Romeo, who leads the Ministry of Justice, and Tamara Finkelstein, the top civil servant at the environment department.",
      "Nevertheless his appointment came as a bit of a surprise in Westminster, where there was a feeling that Sir Chris's time had been and gone.",
      "While some civil servants privately share Cummings' assessment of their new boss, those in the health department may welcome the fact that the top job has been given to someone who understands the NHS.",
      "Getting down NHS waiting lists is one of the prime minister's priorities and he may have had this in mind when picking Sir Chris.",
      "Another factor in the selection could be Sir Chris's relatively low media profile.",
      "Bruised by the brief tenure of his well-known chief of staff Sue Gray, the prime minister will hope that Sir Chris largely continues to go under the radar of the wider public's consciousness."

      "For the first time in almost a decade, MPs will vote on Friday on giving terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to have an assisted death. While it\u2019s something that remains illegal in most countries, more than 300 million people now live in countries which have legalised assisted dying.",

      "The proposed bill in England and Wales comes with safeguards supporters say will make it the strictest set of rules in the world, with patients needing the approval of a High Court judge. Critics on the other hand say changing the law would be a dangerous step that would place the vulnerable at risk. They argue the focus should be on improving patchy access to palliative care.",

      "Across the US, assisted dying - which some critics prefer to call assisted suicide - is legal in 10 states, as well as in Washington DC. Oregon was one of the first places in the world to offer help to die for some patients, in 1997, and so has more than 25 years\u2019 experience. It has become the model on which other US assisted dying laws have been framed.",
      "In Oregon, assisted dying is open to terminally ill, mentally competent adults expected to die within six months - and must be signed off by two doctors. Since 1997, 4,274 people have received a prescription for a lethal dose of medication - with 2,847 (67%) deaths.",
      "Two thirds of patients in the state who asked for help to die last year had cancer. Around one in 10 had a neurological condition and about the same proportion had heart disease. Of the 367 patients who took a lethal dose of medication last year, the vast majority (91.6%) said loss of autonomy was a key concern, while others cited:",

      "Oregon is important for supporters of assisted dying in England and Wales as they point out it has remained restricted to terminally ill adults since its introduction. However, opponents say some of the rules have been relaxed. A residency requirement has been lifted, which means it is open to people from outside the state. The number of assisted deaths has also risen substantially over the years.",
      "Canada",
      "Canada is the country often cited by opponents of assisted dying as an example of the so-called \"slippery slope\" - a place where assisted dying has been extended and made available to more people since it was first brought in. Medical assistance in dying (Maid) was introduced in 2016, initially just for the terminally ill.",
      "This was amended in 2021 and extended to those experiencing \"unbearable suffering\" from an irreversible illness or disability. It\u2019s still due to become available to those with a mental illness in three years, despite delays.",
      "Critics say the more the law is widened, the more disabled and vulnerable people will be put at risk. There has also been a dramatic growth in the number of people using Maid. Four in 100 deaths in Canada are now medically assisted, compared to about one in 100 in Oregon.",
      "Kim Leadbeater, the MP who proposed the assisted dying bill in Westminster, says the Canadian system is not what is being debated for England and Wales, where eligibility would be restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Europe",
      "Across Europe, six countries have some form of legalised assisted dying: Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain and Austria. In all of them - unlike the proposals in England and Wales - help to die is not restricted to the terminally ill.",
      "Switzerland was the first country in the world to create a \u201cright to die\u201d when it made assisted suicide legal in 1942. It is one of the few countries which allows foreigners access to help to die via organisations like Dignitas, in Zurich. More than 500 Britons have died at Dignitas in the past two decades, including 40 last year. The lethal medication must be self-administered.",
      "The Netherlands and Belgium both legalised assisted dying more than 20 years ago for patients experiencing unbearable suffering from an incurable illness, including mental health issues. It has since been extended to children - the only European countries to allow this. Both allow euthanasia - or physician-assisted dying.",
      "Most recently, Spain and Austria have legalised assisted dying for both terminal illness and intolerable suffering. In Austria, the drugs must be self-administered, whereas in Spain a medical professional can administer them.",
      "Despite the variation, what\u2019s clear is that eligibility for assisted dying is far wider across Europe than is being proposed anywhere in the British Isles. MSPs at Holyrood are to debate a similar bill covering Scotland as that being voted on at Westminster.",
      "A bill to allow terminally ill adult patients to die if they have 12 months or less to live has nearly passed all its stages in the Isle of Man parliament. The legislation is likely to get Royal Assent next year and the first assisted death on the island could happen in 2027. There is a residency requirement of five years. Jersey has also committed to changing the law to allow assisted dying for the terminally ill.",
      "Australia and New Zealand",
      "In the past few years voluntary assisted dying has become legal across most of Australia. While in New Zealand, patients must be terminally ill and expected to die within six months. That is extended to 12 months for those with a neurodegenerative condition in eligible parts of Australia.",
      "In both countries, patients can self-administer the lethal medication. But it can also be administered by a doctor or nurse, usually via an intravenous injection.",

      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",

      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards.

    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 01:12:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Governments don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay more, argues an expert.",
    "story": [
      "It is the perfect start to a holiday: your plane ticket is cheap, your cabin baggage is safely stowed, the engines are roaring into life - and the pilot has announced that there\u2019s no need to worry about the environmental impact.",
      "This is Jet Zero, a vision where air travel is entirely carbon neutral thanks to new technology and green ventures that offset the environmental impact. The plan was drafted in 2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister, marking a step towards the government\u2019s legal obligation to reach net zero by 2050. The Labour government has since made a similar pledge, and in addition it wants all domestic flights and UK airport operations to reach zero emissions by 2040.",
      "This is no easy feat when you consider the scale of the challenge: one passenger taking an economy-class flight from London to New York generates 309kg of carbon dioxide, which would take roughly a year to absorb via 10 mature trees.",
      "Multiply this on the global scale and the aviation industry would need to plant roughly 100 billion mature trees each year to offset its emissions. For UK emissions alone you\u2019d need a forest almost the size of Wales.",
      "So, just how realistic is the plan to hit Jet Zero by 2050? And what is the knock-on cost for passengers?",
      "Earlier this year, Anthony Browne, who was the aviation minister in the Conservative government at the time, said that he thought any increase in ticket prices would be \u201cmarginal\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe don't think the difference will be noticeable to most consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "But some experts claim that politicians are not being realistic. Sir Dieter Helm, professor of economic policy at the University of Oxford, argues that there \u201cdefinitely would be higher cost\u201d.",
      "\u201cGovernments desperately don\u2019t want to tell people they\u2019re going to have to pay for what they do.\u201d",
      "But ultimately, the cost depends on which methods are employed to cut or reduce emissions.",
      "From sharklets to UltraFans",
      "The previous government said that it aimed reach Jet Zero by focusing on \"the rapid development of technologies\u201d, as well as operational improvements and - among other things - more sustainable fuel types.",
      "This is not an entirely new quest. Aircraft around the world have been steadily getting cleaner since 1969 when the first high-bypass turbofan engines were used on the new Boeing 747 aircraft. In the years since there have been other innovations including sharklets, or upturned wing tips on modern planes that reduce drag and save, on average, 4% of fuel per trip.",
      "More developments are in the pipeline, including a new type of jet engine, developed by Rolls Royce, called the \u201cUltraFan\u201d, which will reduce average fuel consumption by 10%.",
      "\u201cBecause it\u2019s a gearbox, the turbine can run very fast, much more efficiently, the fan can run slower and be much bigger,\u201c explains Simon Burr, a director at Rolls-Royce.",
      "The problem is that, though it was first tested in 2023, it\u2019s unlikely to be available on commercial aircraft until the 2030s because of production lead times - and even then, a 10% improvement is impressive but not a game changer.",
      "Aviation\u2019s CO2 emissions come primarily through jet engines using carbon-rich fossil fuels, which produce CO2 when burned, so there have been attempts to create an alternative type made from renewable biomass and waste resources, known as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).",
      "The first SAF flight ran between London and Amsterdam in 2008 using fuel derived from a mixture of Brazilian babassu nuts and coconuts.",
      "Now the British government says that 22% of all jet fuel from UK aviation has to come from sustainable sources by 2040. But this comes with further challenges.",
      "In the UK, SAF is mainly made from cooking oil, some of which is shipped from Asia, and shipping is responsible for 2% of global CO2 emissions.",
      "Alternative methods of creating SAF require large quantities of electricity as part of the manufacturing process. This would involve a vast amount of renewable energy to make it sustainable.",
      "\"It's very hard, to think there is such a thing as a sustainable aviation fuel,\u201d says Sir Dieter Helm. \u201cThere are aviation fuels that are less polluting than the ones being used at the moment, and you can use elements of biofuel and chip fat and so on.",
      "\"Think about the scale that's required to do it.\u201d",
      "Remapping the sky",
      "There is another more unexpected way that airlines could reduce emissions. That is, making their flight paths more direct to reduce fuel consumption.",
      "Currently most planes fly on routes determined by a network of beacons, many of which were put in place decades ago. As a result they don\u2019t always fly by the shortest route, but \"airspace modernisation\", as it is known, will allow for straighter paths to destinations.",
      "Satellite technology is required to do this: aircraft flying over the Atlantic used to have to fly at least 40 miles apart, but the satellite technology means that aircraft can in theory fly as close as 14 miles apart, allowing more aircraft to fly on the direct flight paths.",
      "The Jet Zero Strategy estimates that this, together with other fuel efficiency improvements, could cut emissions by as much as 15% by 2050.",
      "But the National Air Traffic Services (NATS), which control most flights in and out of England and Wales, caution that these changes are neither easy nor quick. \u201cIt's a very, very complicated thing to do,\u201d warns Chris Norsworthy, director of future planning.",
      "\u201cThe national infrastructure change of this type takes many years. The deployments we've made already are years in the making.\u201d",
      "The electric plane race",
      "Hidden away in a mini aircraft hangar of sorts, just outside Bristol, inventor Stephen Fitzpatrick has spent seven years working on a pioneering aircraft that could be the basis of another solution. His carbon fibre creation, known as VX4, has eight propellers and looks like a giant drone, but what's crucial is that it doesn\u2019t use fuel. Instead it is powered by lithium-ion batteries similar to those in electric cars.",
      "The batteries alone weigh 800kg, which brings the first challenge: the sheer weight limits how far it can fly.",
      "Mr Fitzpatrick says the VX4 will have a range of around 100 miles to begin with. \u201cEach year the batteries that we use will improve... Over time, we\u2019ll be able to develop a hybrid powertrain, probably using hydrogen fuel cells and batteries, and that will increase the range further.\u201d",
      "The prospect of replacing jet engine-powered long-haul flights is, however, remote. \u201cThere is no battery chemistry in the world that will give us the energy we need to take hundreds of passengers over the Atlantic,\u201d he concedes.",
      "Harnessing hydrogen in other ways may be a better bet.",
      "The British-American aircraft company, ZeroAvia, says it expects to have an 80-seater powered entirely by hydrogen in the air within two to three years. Airbus is developing something similar.",
      "Both are propeller planes, however, with limited speeds and ranges.",
      "The pricetag for passengers",
      "The reductions from SAF, fuel efficiency improvements and zero carbon aircraft will only cut aviation emissions by around a third, according to the previous government's estimates. So another part of the Jet Zero strategy involves a pricing scheme to charge airlines for CO2 emissions and carbon offsetting.",
      "Airlines already pay a duty for each flight someone takes in the UK, a cost that is passed to passengers. In much of the UK (excluding Scotland) this adds \u00a37 to each domestic flight, \u00a314 to short-haul ones and \u00a392 for long-haul. But carbon offsetting means paying another fee.",
      "Some schemes have been highly controversial, with questions around how to prove how many trees have been prevented from being cut down.",
      "Cait Hewitt, policy director at the Aviation Environment Federation, is concerned that the current informal offsetting projects may be counterproductive: \u201cThey could actually have made that problem a bit worse over time by giving consumers the false impression that the emissions from their flight [are] being cancelled out somehow by an offset.\u201d",
      "The Lebanon ceasefire is a respite, not a solution for the Middle East",
      "How service charges in flats spiralled out of control",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "Duncan McCourt, chief executive of Sustainable Aviation, an umbrella group for UK airlines, airports, manufacturers and others in the business, is optimistic that removing carbon from flying won\u2019t add much more than a few pounds to the cost of an airline ticket.",
      "\u201cWe think we can do it while enabling people to continue to fly and continue to get that benefit of flying, such as connecting people, such as being able to go on holiday,\u201d he says.",
      "But the Jet Zero plan says nothing directly about the knock-on cost to passengers. Instead, it refers to \u201cdemand management\u201d.",
      "Sir Dieter Helm has his own take on what Jet Zero means for holidaymakers and fully believes that it will lead to higher costs. As for the likelihood of the government hitting its Jet Zero target on time, he is unconvinced of this too, but he also suggests that this may not be the point.",
      "\u201cIt depends whether you think Jet Zero is\u2026 genuinely a target and they mean to achieve it. I'm really sceptical about the second.\u201d",
      "And now, the number of flights taken annually by people in the UK is projected to rise even further, translating into an additional 150 million more flights a year. So the scale of the government's challenge, which was large enough when it began, is only set to grow.",

    "story": [
      "The price of Bitcoin has for the first time broken past the $100,000 mark, hitting a new record high.",
      "The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies.",
      "The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.",
      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler.",
      "The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.",
      "Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps.",
      "But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.",
      "Millions of viewers even tuned in to online watch parties as the price hovered close to $100k.",
      "The value of a single bitcoin is one of the barometers of optimism in the cryptocurrency industry which is now estimated to be worth $3.3tn, according to analysis firm Coin Market Cap.",
      "Trump's election victory last month was the catalyst for the latest surge.",
      "The president-elect has vowed to make the US \"the crypto capital of the planet\" - a remarkable turnaround given as recently as 2021 he was calling Bitcoin a \"scam.\"",
      "Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.",
      "But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.",
      "From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

      "Telegram is used by around 950 million people worldwide and has previously positioned itself as an app focussed on its users' privacy rather than the policy norms prioritised by other global social media companies.",

      "The partnership with the IWF appears to be the latest step in that process.",
      "The IWF is one of a few organisations in the world that is legally able to search for child sexual content to get it taken down.",
      "Its ever-evolving list of known abuse content is used by websites to detect and block matches to stop it spreading.",
      "Telegram says that before becoming a member of IWF it removed hundreds of thousands of pieces of abuse material each month using its own systems. The IWF membership will strengthen its mechanisms, the company said.",
      "The app is marketed as a fully end-to-end encrypted messaging service - meaning only the sender and recipient of a message can read it - like WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "But in fact the majority of communication is done with standard encryption, raising questions about how secure from hacking and interception it is.",
      "Mr Durov, who was born in Russia and now lives in Dubai, has citizenship in Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St Kitts and Nevis.",
      "Telegram is particularly popular in Russia, Ukraine and former Soviet Union states as well as Iran.",

      "Game developers have been hit by slowing demand after the pandemic - but some are also concerned about the impact of AI on jobs.",
      "Advances in the technology have the potential to allow many of the mundane parts of game development to become automated.",

      "Discord over Concord",
      "Since taking over in June, the two bosses have faced a number of difficult moments.",
      "The much-anticipated shooting game Concord turned into a high-profile failure, with players who bought it being refunded, and the studio closed.",
      "\"Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline,\" Mr Hulst said at the time.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 01:36:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Wearable tech claims to help monitor our health, but many doctors remain sceptical.",
    "story": [
      "Wearable tech \u2013 currently dominated by smart watches - is a multi-billion dollar industry with a sharp focus on health tracking.",
      "Many premium products claim to accurately track exercise routines, body temperature, heart rate, menstrual cycle and sleep patterns, among others.",
      "Health Secretary Wes Streeting has talked about a proposal to give wearables to millions of NHS patients in England, enabling them to track symptoms such as reactions to cancer treatments, from home.",
      "But many doctors \u2013 and tech experts \u2013 remain cautious about using health data captured by wearables.",
      "I\u2019m currently trying out a smart ring from the firm Ultrahuman \u2013 and it seemed to know that I was getting sick before I did.",
      "It alerted me one weekend that my temperature was slightly elevated, and my sleep had been restless. It warned me that this could be a sign I was coming down with something.",
      "I tutted something about the symptoms of perimenopause and ignored it - but two days later I was laid up in bed with gastric flu.",
      "I didn\u2019t need medical assistance, but if I had \u2013 would the data from my wearable have helped healthcare professionals with my treatment? Many wearable brands actively encourage this.",
      "The Oura smart ring, for example, offers a service where patients can download their data in the form of a report to share with their doctor.",
      "Dr Jake Deutsch, a US-based clinician who also advises Oura, says wearable data enables him to \u201cassess overall health more precisely\u201d \u2013 but not all doctors agree that it\u2019s genuinely useful all of the time.",
      "Dr Helen Salisbury is a GP at a busy practice in Oxford. She says not many patients come in brandishing their wearables, but she\u2019s noticed it has increased, and it concerns her.",
      "\u201cI think for the number of times when it\u2019s useful there\u2019s probably more times that it\u2019s not terribly useful, and I worry that we are building a society of hypochondria and over-monitoring of our bodies,\u201d she says.",
      "Dr Salisbury says there can be a large number of reasons why we might temporarily get abnormal data such as an increased heart rate, whether it\u2019s a blip in our bodies or a device malfunction - and many of them do not require further investigation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we will be encouraging people to monitor everything all the time, and see their doctor every time the machine thinks they\u2019re ill, rather than when they think they\u2019re ill.\u201d",
      "And she makes a further point about the psychological use of this data as a kind of insurance policy against shock health diagnoses. A nasty cancerous tumour for example, is not necessarily going to be flagged by a watch or an app, she says.",
      "What wearables do is encourage good habits - but the best message you can take from them is the same advice doctors have been giving us for years. Dr Salisbury adds: \u201cThe thing you can actually do is walk more, don\u2019t drink too much alcohol, try and maintain a healthy weight. That never changes.\u201d",
      "The Apple Watch is reported to be the world\u2019s best-selling smart watch, although sales have slowed lately.",
      "Apple didn't comment, but the tech giant uses true stories of people whose lives have been saved because of the heart tracking function of the device in its marketing, and anecdotally I have heard plenty of those too. What I haven\u2019t heard however, is how many cases of false positives there are.",
      "In many cases when patients present their data to healthcare professionals, clinicians prefer to try to recreate it using their own equipment, rather than simply trust what the wearable has captured.",
      "There are several reasons for this, says Dr Yang Wei, associate professor in wearable technologies at Nottingham Trent University  \u2013 and they\u2019re all very practical.",
      "\u201cWhen you go to hospital, and you measure your ECG [electrocardiogram, a test that checks the activity of your heart], you don\u2019t worry about power consumption because the machine is plugged into the wall,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cOn your watch, you\u2019re not going to measure your ECG continuously because you drain your battery straight away.\u201d",
      "In addition, movement \u2013 both of the wearable itself on a wrist, for example, and general movement of the person wearing it - can \u201ccreate noise\u201d in the data it collects, he adds, making it less reliable.",
      "Dr Wei points to the ring on my finger.",
      "\u201cThe gold standard to measure the heart rate is from the wrist or direct from the heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you measure from the finger, you\u2019re sacrificing accuracy.\"",
      "It is the role of software to fill in such data gaps, he says - but there\u2019s no international standard for wearables here - for either the sensors and software that power wearable devices, or for the data itself, and even what format it is gathered in.",
      "The more consistently a device is worn, the more accurate its data is likely to be. But here\u2019s a cautionary tale.",
      "Ben Wood was out for the day when his wife received a series of alarming notifications from his Apple Watch, telling her he had been in a car crash. It advised her to text him rather than call because he may need to keep the line clear for the emergency services.",
      "The alerts were genuine, and sent to her as his emergency contact \u2013 but in this case unnecessary. Ben was out at a race track driving some fast cars. He admitted that he \u201cwasn\u2019t very gifted\u201d at it \u2013 but said he felt safe at all times.",
      "\u201cThe boundaries between incident and alert need to be managed carefully,\u201d he wrote in a blog post. \u201cI\u2019m curious to see how device-makers, emergency services, first responders and individuals think about this technology in the future.\u201d",
      "Pritesh Mistry, digital technologies fellow at the Kings Fund, agrees that there are significant challenges around folding current patient-generated data into our healthcare systems, and adds that the discussion has already been going on for several years in the UK without any clear resolution.",
      "He says there\u2019s \u201ca good case to be made\u201d for the use of wearables in the UK government\u2019s current drive to push care out of hospitals and into community settings.",
      "\u201cBut without that underpinning foundation of technology enablement in terms of the infrastructure, and supporting the workforce to have the skills, knowledge, capacity and confidence, I think it\u2019s going to be a challenge,\u201d he adds.",

    "title": "Could a thermal camera reveal your home's hidden heat loss?",
    "published": "Fri, 29 Nov 2024 00:05:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Thermal imaging tech has become cheaper and homeowners are using it to track down heat loss.",
    "story": [
      "It\u2019s like X-ray vision \u2013 for heat loss. Last year, web engineer Jamie Matthews bought a thermal imaging camera. His home, in the southeast of England, was about to give up some of its secrets.",
      "The colourful images on the device\u2019s small screen soon revealed how his loft hatch was letting him down.",
      "\u201cThat was really obvious on the camera,\u201d he says, explaining that he could see cool areas on the hatch, where heat was apparently escaping.",
      "Mr Mathews, who runs a software company that supplies the clean tech industry, also found some other small gaps in external walls and parts of his roof that appeared less well insulated than others.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good fun and it certainly shows up things that may not be immediately obvious,\u201d he says.",
      "While Mr Matthews was able to draught-proof some areas himself, he says he would take a more methodical approach if he were planning any major changes to his home. The web engineer later had a professional heat loss survey carried out when he installed a heat pump, for example.",
      "That approach is sensible, according to building physics researchers who spoke to the BBC. There are signs that thermal cameras are becoming more popular, as homeowners seek to slash their heating bills and carbon emissions. Local councils are increasingly allowing residents to borrow the devices for free, for example.",
      "But there is no substitute for professional advice if you are planning big works or interventions, experts say.",
      "Thermal cameras work by using a sensor to detect infrared light, which we cannot see, but which we can sometimes feel as heat. Such devices aren\u2019t cheap. Mr Matthews spent roughly \u00a3160 on his, though organisations including local councils and energy supplier Octopus Energy do loan them out to people free of charge so that they can gain a basic understanding of heat loss in their homes.",
      "Wiltshire Council recently made 11 devices available to borrow from local libraries, as well as a brief guide on how to use them. There has been \u201chuge uptake\u201d says Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, such that the council now has a waiting list for interested residents.",
      "\"Expert advice, combined with a measured approach to the findings from thermal imaging, will give residents the best chance of making informed decisions about energy-saving home improvements,\" says Cllr Blair-Pilling.",
      "Small interventions could help people keep their homes warm and reduce the risk of cold-related health conditions, he adds.",
      "However, Jo Atkinson, senior consultant in buildings decarbonisation at Energy Systems Catapult, a research organisation, expresses concern over the growing availability of thermal cameras: \u201cIn my opinion, the risks are too great for making the wrong choices.\u201d",
      "It is possible to misinterpret thermal camera images, she says, noting that if a wall has been warmed by the sun, an image of that wall taken outside could make it look as though heat is escaping, when it is not. Reflective surfaces can also appear, misleadingly, to be leaking heat.",
      "While using a thermal camera as a starting point for understanding your home is \u201cabsolutely fine\u201d, according to Ronita Bardhan at the University of Cambridge, it is important to ask for independent expert advice when planning any renovation works.",
      "Thermal camera imagery can make it look as though some areas of your home are losing a lot of heat, but this might simply be a result of how the camera has been calibrated, how the user holds it and moves it around, and which colour palette was chosen for the display.",
      "Dr Bardhan adds that there is a risk of triggering \u201cretrofit anxiety\u201d in homeowners.",
      "Plus, if people go on to alter their insulation, for example, such measures should be taken with great care as improper installation can cause damp and mould.",
      "North Somerset Council provides thermal cameras to residents, on loan, and this scheme is also currently operating on a waiting list basis due to its popularity. The Council has published introductory advice on how to use the cameras, including an online video.",
      "The Centre for Sustainable Energy (CSE), a charity, highlights a more detailed guide from the National House-Building Council, which describes how to use thermal cameras. However, a CSE spokeswoman adds that the organisation still recommends people seek expert advice.",
      "Phil Steele, future technologies evangelist at Octopus Energy, agrees: \u201cYou have got to be careful.\u201d Thermal cameras can, for instance, make the corners of rooms look very cold but this is simply a reflection of reduced air circulation in those areas, rather than an insulation problem, he explains.",
      "Octopus Energy has around 500 cameras that it loans out to customers every winter. Last year, the firm distributed the devices roughly 3,800 times.",
      "Thermal camera-wielding homeowners who have spoken to the BBC, such as Mr Matthews, say they have treated the imagery with caution.",
      "Louise Green, a designer in London, says she read online training materials before using a thermal camera to search for points of heat loss in a house shortly after she and her partner moved in.",
      "In her case, Miss Green rented the camera from Library of Things, a community-focused organisation that makes various items available for people to borrow. The device indicated loss of heat around windows and doors in Miss Green\u2019s home. She and her partner were able to compare the results to their neighbour\u2019s better-insulated property.",
      "\u201cIt just confirmed what we knew already, but it was still interesting to see, you know, were there any other areas?\u201d she explains.",
      "Darrell Taylor at Flir, a firm that makes thermal cameras, says that members of the public can access some free training materials on his company\u2019s website.",
      "He adds that Flir aims to make thermal images as clear and easy to interpret as possible \u2013 including by merging optical imagery with thermal imagery, to add more detail to the final picture. And he suggests that, in the future, Flir cameras may offer machine learning-based instructions and advice as people use the devices.",
      "Those who know how best to interpret thermal camera imagery can find extraordinary hidden problems in a building, though.",
      "Dr Bardhan recently took a very high resolution camera to a viewing of a house she was considering buying. But the thermal images revealed cracks in a wall, which later proved to be signs of subsidence.",
      "\u201cThat would probably not have been exposed unless I had gone in and seen it,\u201d she says. Dr Bardhan decided not to make an offer on the property.",

      "The value of the world's biggest cryptocurrency has been boosted by hopes US President-elect Donald Trump will adopt crypto-friendly policies.",
      "The milestone was reached hours after Trump said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) commissioner Paul Atkins to run the Wall Street regulator.",
      "Mr Atkins is seen as being far more pro-cryptocurrency than the current head of the SEC, Gary Gensler.",
      "The $100,000 milestone prompted celebrations from cryptocurrency fans around the world.",
      "Bitcoin's wildly fluctuating value has always attracted interest, with its backers reacting with delight when it has passed previous price thresholds - and defiance during its slumps.",
      "But this particular landmark has been especially keenly anticipated. For weeks charts, memes and predictions have swirled around social media about when the price would hit the figure thought to be one of the holy grails of the crypto world.",

      "Also remarkable is just how Bitcoin's price has rocketed. A valuation of $100k represents a 40% increase on election day in the U.S. and more than double the price it started the year at.",
      "But there's lots more to Bitcoin than the dizzying changes in its value.",
      "From its enigmatic inventor to the bringing down of the so-called Crypto King, it's a story with many twists and turns, which has seen the making - and losing - of huge fortunes.",
      "So here's the BBC's list of the seven wildest moments - so far - in Bitcoin's tumultuous history.",
      "1. The mysterious creator of Bitcoin",
      "Despite its enormous profile, no-one actually knows for sure who invented Bitcoin. The idea for it was posted on internet forums in 2008 by someone calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto.",
      "They explained how a peer-to-peer digital cash system could work to enable people to send virtual coins over the internet, just as easily as sending an email.",
      "Satoshi created a complex computer system that would process transactions and create new coins using a huge network of self-appointed volunteers around the world who used special software and powerful computers.",
      "But he - or they - never revealed their identity, and the world has never worked it out.",
      "In 2014, Japanese-American man Dorian Nakamoto was pursued by reporters who thought he was the elusive Bitcoin creator, but it proved to be a false lead caused by some mistranslated information.",
      "Australian computer scientist Craig Wright said it was him in 2016 - but after years of legal battles, a High Court judge concluded he was not Satoshi.",
      "Earlier this year, a Canadian Bitcoin expert called Peter Todd strongly denied being Satoshi, while in London this month a British man, Stephen Mollah, claimed he was - but no-one believed him.",
      "2. Making history with pizza",
      "Bitcoin now underpins a two trillion-dollar cryptocurrency industry - but the first recorded transaction using it was the purchase of pizza.",
      "On 22 May 2010, Lazlo Hanyecz, offered $41 worth of Bitcoin on a crypto forum in return for two pizzas.",
      "A 19-year-old student obliged and the day went down in history for fans of the currency as #BitcoinPizza day.",
      "A source of memes for those in crypto community, it also showcased the power of Bitcoin - an internet money that could genuinely buy items online.",
      "Criminals must have been watching too, because within a year the first darknet marketplace was launched selling drugs and other illegal goods in exchange for Bitcoin.",
      "The deal looks pretty bad for Lazlo now too. If he had held onto those coins they would now be worth hundreds of millions of dollars!",
      "3. Becoming legal tender",
      "In September 2021, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, central America, made Bitcoin legal tender.",
      "Hairdressers, supermarkets and other shops had to accept Bitcoin by law, alongside its main currency, the US dollar.",
      "Many Bitcoin enthusiasts and reporters visited the area, briefly boosting tourism to the country.",
      "While President Bukele hoped the move would increase investment in his country and cut costs for citizens exchanging money, it did not become as popular as he hoped.",
      "He is still hoping it will take off but for now the US dollar still remains king in the country.",
      "As well as the huge amount of public money President Bukele spent on trying to make people embrace Bitcoin he also, controversially, bought more than 6,000 bitcoins over the past few years.",
      "The president spent at least $120m buying up bitcoins at various prices in the hope of making a profit for his cash-strapped country.",
      "It started to look good for him in December 2023 when, for the first time, his stash skyrocketed in value.",
      "A website built by Dutch software engineer Elias Zerrouq is tracking the country's Bitcoin holdings and currently estimates that the coins have risen 98% in value.",
      "4. Kazakhstan's crypto boom and bust",
      "In 2021, Kazakhstan became a hotspot for Bitcoin mining - the process of crunching through the complex calculations that underpin crypto transactions.",
      "These days it takes warehouses full of the latest computers running all day and all night, but the reward is brand new bitcoins for those companies that take part.",
      "Warehouses of computers require lots of power - and many businesses moved to Kazakhstan where electricity was abundant thanks to huge coal reserves.",
      "At first the government welcomed them with open arms as they brought investment.",
      "But too many miners arrived and put huge strain on the electricity grid, putting the country at risk of blackouts.",
      "Within a year, Kazakhstan's Bitcoin mining industry went from boom to bust as the government imposed restrictions and increased taxes to curb the growth.",
      "Around the world it is estimated that the Bitcoin network uses as much electricity as a small country, raising concerns about its environmental impact.",
      "5. Bitcoins in the rubbish dump",
      "Imagine having a crypto wallet worth more than $100m (\u00a378m) - and then  accidentally throwing away a hard drive containing the login details.",
      "That's what James Howells, from south Wales, says happened to him",
      "The very nature of crypto means that recovery is not as easy as resetting your password. With no banks involved - there is no customer support helpline.",
      "Unfortunately for him, his local council in Newport refused to let him access the landfill site where he says the device ended up - even after he offered to donate 25% of his Bitcoin stash to local charities if they let him.",
      "He told the BBC: \"It was a penny dropping moment and it was a sinking feeling.\"",
      "6. Crypto King fraudster",
      "No one has lost as much Bitcoin as former billionaire crypto mogul, Sam Bankman-Fried. The founder of the massive crypto firm FTX was nicknamed the Crypto King and loved by the community.",
      "FTX was a cryptocurrency exchange that allowed people to trade normal money for cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "His empire was worth an estimated $32bn and he was flying high until everything came crashing down within days.",
      "Journalists had discovered that Bankman-Fried's company was financially shaky and had been illegally transferring FTX customer funds to prop up his other company, Alameda Research.",
      "Just before his arrest at his luxury apartment complex in the Bahamas in December 2022 he spoke to reporters. He told the BBC: \"I don't think I committed fraud. I didn't want any of this to happen. I was certainly not nearly as competent as I thought I was.\"",
      "After being extradited to the US he was found guilty of fraud and money laundering and was jailed for 25 years.",
      "7. Investment bank boom",
      "Despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin continues to attract attention from investors and big companies.",
      "In fact, in January 2024, some of the biggest financial firms in the world added Bitcoin to their official asset lists as Spot Bitcoin ETFs. These are like stocks and shares, linked to the value of Bitcoin but you don't have to personally own any.",
      "Customers have been pouring billions into these brand new products. Companies including Blackrock, Fidelity and GrayScale, have also been buying up Bitcoins in their thousands, pushing up its value to record highs.",
      "It is a huge milestone for crypto with some fans believing that Bitcoin is finally being taken as seriously as the mysterious Satoshi imagined.",
      "Nonetheless, few would back against more wild moments as the Bitcoin story continues to unfold."

    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 02:24:35 GMT",
    "summary": "A number of promising new drugs from India show potential to fight antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",
    "story": [
      "Antibiotics are hailed as medical saviours.",
      "But they are increasingly facing a crafty adversary: bacteria that mutate and adapt and outwit the very drugs designed to defeat them and cure the infections they cause.",
      "These  antibiotic-resistant \"superbugs\" directly caused 1.14 million deaths worldwide in 2021, according to The Lancet, a medical journal. Antibiotics - which are considered to be the first line of defence against severe infections - did not work on most of these cases.",
      "India is among the countries hardest hit by \"antimicrobial resistance\". In 2019 alone, antibiotic-resistant infections caused around 300,000 deaths. They alone are responsible for the deaths of nearly 60,000 newborns each year.",
      "But some hope is on the horizon. A number of promising locally-developed new drugs show potential to combat antibiotic-resistant pathogens. They also offer a game-changing solution to preserve last-resort treatments.",
      "Enmetazobactam, developed by Chennai-based Orchid Pharma, is the first antimicrobial invented in India to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This injectable drug treats severe conditions like urinary tract infections (UTIs), pneumonia and bloodstream infections by targeting bacteria\u2019s defence mechanisms rather than the bacteria itself.",
      "Bacteria often produce enzymes, like beta-lactamase, to destroy antibiotics. Enmetazobactam binds tightly to those enzymes, neutralising them and allowing the antibiotic to kill the bacteria effectively.",
      "To put it simply, the drug immobilises the bacteria\u2019s \"weapon\" without triggering resistance easily. This also preserves the effectiveness of other antibiotics, including carbapenems, which are the reliable \u201clast line of defence\u201d drugs.",
      "Trials across 19 countries - the drug has been approved by global regulators - with more than 1,000 patients have shown its effectiveness. \u201cThe drug has shown remarkable potency against these bacteria that have evolved over the years. It is administered via intravenous [IV] infusion in hospitals, specifically for critically ill patients, and is not available over the counter,\u201d Dr Maneesh Paul, the lead co-inventor of the drug, told the BBC.",
      "Mumbai-based Wockhardt is testing a new antibiotic, called Zaynich, for severe drug-resistant infections. Developed over 25 years, the drug is currently in Phase-3 trials and expected to launch next year.",
      "Dr Habib Khorakiwala, founder chairman of Wockhardt, has described Zaynich as a \"ground-breaking, one-of-its-kind new antibiotic designed to combat all major superbugs\". It was administered on compassionate grounds to 30 critically ill patients in India who were unresponsive to any other antibiotics. Remarkably, all survived.  \"This would make India proud,\" Dr Khorakiwala said.",
      "Also in Phase-3 testing is Wockhardt's Nafithromycin, trademarked as MIQNAF, a three-day oral treatment for community-acquired bacterial pneumonia with a 97% success rate. Existing treatments to the disease have resistance as high as 60%. Its trials are set to conclude next year and once it's approved, the company says it could be launched commercially by late next year.",
      "A 30-member Bengaluru-based biopharma firm Bugworks Research has partnered with Geneva-based non-profit Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership, or GARDP, to develop a new class of antibiotics for treating serious drug-resistant infections. Currently in early Phase-1 trials, the drug is five-to-eight years from market readiness.",
      "\"Antibiotics are becoming less effective, but big money is in drugs for cancer, diabetes and other conditions, not antibiotics,\" Anand Anandkumar, CEO of Bugworks, told the BBC. \"There's little innovation because antibiotics are kept as a last-resort option. Big pharma isn't focusing on antibiotic resistance. We've been funded by different organisations, but less than 10% of our funding comes from India.\"",
      "But that needs to change. A 2023 drug resistance surveillance report by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which analysed nearly 100,000 bacterial cultures from 21 specialised care hospitals around India, highlighted worrying trends in antibiotic resistance.",
      "E.coli (Escherichia coli), commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals after consumption of contaminated food, was the most frequently isolated pathogen.",
      "This was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which can cause pneumonia and also infect the blood, cuts in the skin and the lining of the brain to cause meningitis. Coming close was the rise of the multidrug-resistant pathogen called Acinetobacter baumannii, which attacks the lungs of patients on life support in critical care units.",
      "The survey found antibiotic effectiveness against E.coli had consistently sharply declined while Klebsiella pneumoniae showed an alarming rise in drug resistance. Doctors found that some of the main antibiotics were less than 15% effective in treating infections caused by these pathogens. Most worrying was the rising resistance to carbapenems, a critical last-resort antibiotic.",
      "\"It's like playing whack-a-mole with bacteria. They evolve at an incredibly fast pace, and we\u2019re always playing catch-up. You get rid of one, another pops up. We need more innovation and to learn from past mistakes,\" Dr Manica Balasegaram, executive director of GARDP, told the BBC.",
      "Not surprisingly, GARDP is focussing on India. It\u2019s collaborating with Hyderabad-based Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services to produce zoliflodacin, a novel oral antibiotic for gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease which is showing increasing resistance to antibiotics. GARDP has also partnered with Japan's pharma company Shionogi to distribute cefiderocol - a breakthrough FDA-approved antibiotic for tough infections like UTIs and hospital-acquired pneumonia - in 135 countries, with plans for production in India.",
      "But this is only one part of the story. Doctors say drug prescription practices in India urgently need reform. The widespread use of broad-spectrum antibiotics - they target many bacteria types but can kill good bacteria, cause side-effects and increase antibiotic resistance - fuels drug resistance by encouraging the emergence of drug resistant bacterial mutants.",
      "Instead, say doctors, narrow-spectrum antibiotics should be prioritised. But  hospitals often lack antibiograms - microbiology-based antibiotic guidelines - forcing doctors to prescribe \"broadly and blindly\".",
      "\"I am definitely excited that we will have these new drugs. But what is also important is that we should create mechanisms that they should not be misused the way we have previously done with [what were once also] blockbuster drugs. Improper and irresponsible use will compromise the longevity of these new drugs,\" warns Dr Kamini Walia, a scientist at ICMR.",
      "The rapid mutation of bacteria, which can evolve in a matter of hours, underscores the urgency of a holistic approach. This includes reducing infections through better water, sanitation and hygiene, improving vaccine uptake, strengthening hospital infection control policies, educating physicians and deterring self-medication by patients. \u201cCombating antimicrobial resistance is a complex, multi-faceted challenge tied to healthcare equity and systemic accountability,\u201d says Dr Walia.",
      "The message is clear: without urgent action, we risk a future where even relatively minor infections could become untreatable."

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 22:57:17 GMT",
    "summary": "US media suggest the president-elect could replace Pete Hegseth, whose selection is under intense scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump's embattled nominee for defence secretary says he still has the president-elect's backing after reports suggested his nomination may be in jeopardy over allegations of misconduct.",
      "Trump is considering replacing Pete Hegseth with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, the BBC's partner CBS News reported, after Hegseth's nomination came under intense scrutiny.",
      "Since Trump nominated the former Fox News host, questions about Hegseth's qualifications have been raised - and a past sexual assault allegation has surfaced.",
      "Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing, and was never arrested or charged.",
      "Hegseth, on Wednesday, did not address the DeSantis reports directly and told reporters that Trump had told him to \"keep going, keep fighting\".",
      "He spent most of the day in closed-door meetings on Capitol Hill, seeking to quell concerns and shore up support in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI spoke to the president this morning. (Trump) supports me fully. We\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Hegseth told the BBC, stopping to speak outside the Senate chamber.",
      "In a post on X on Wednesday morning, Hegseth accused \"the Left\" of trying to smear him with \"fake\" stories.",
      "But his nomination is also the subject of growing scrutiny by members of his own party - including US senators who have the power to confirm or deny his appointment when asked to vote on it.",
      "\"I think some of these articles are very disturbing,\" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told CBS on Tuesday. \"He obviously has a chance to defend himself here, but some of this stuff is going to be difficult.\"",
      "\"The president gets the benefit of the doubt with his nominees,\" fellow Republican Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota told the BBC. \"But we still have a role to play. We\u2019ll ask him questions and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans signalled that they supported Hegseth despite the controversies.",
      "Senator Rick Scott of Florida said he believed Hegseth would receive a Senate confirmation. He told reporters that Hegseth was \"somebody that's clearly smart, and he's somebody that clearly wants to make changes.\"",
      "DeSantis, who was elected Florida governor in 2018, did not reply to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Trump declined to say whether DeSantis was under consideration for the post.",
      "DeSantis ran against Trump in the Republican primary, and before dropping out, he was considered by some to be \"Trump 2.0\" - a Republican who could deliver Trump's populist agenda without the baggage.",
      "The latest speculation - first reported by the Wall Street Journal - comes as Hegseth meets members of Congress this week to discuss the job and drum up support.",
      "Jasmine Crockett, a House Democrat from Texas and vocal Trump critic, does not view DeSantis as a better choice.",
      "Like Hegseth, Crockett says DeSantis will \"continue the culture war issues\" he battled as Florida governor that could hinder the military's \"problem with recruitment\".",
      "A graduate of Princeton and Harvard universities, Hegseth was an infantry platoon leader in Guantanamo Bay and Iraq, and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal.",
      "In nominating Hegseth, who is also a former Fox News TV host, Trump highlighted the former soldier's education, and his military experience in Afghanistan and Iraq.",
      "\"With Pete at the helm, America\u2019s enemies are on notice - our military will be great again, and America will never back down,\" Trump wrote.",
      "But even as a veteran of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the 44-year-old does not have the extensive experience typical for the cabinet position. He also would be the second-youngest person to serve in the office.",
      "In addition, since his nomination, a police report detailing accusations of an alleged sexual assault in 2017 has surfaced.",
      "The woman quoted in the complaint said that Hegseth, then a Fox host, took her phone and blocked the door to a hotel room while at a Republican conference in California.",
      "Hegseth denies any wrongdoing, saying the encounter was consensual.",
      "In an interview published Wednesday, conservative journalist Megyn Kelly asked Hegseth if he had assaulted a woman in Monterey, California, in 2017.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" he replied.",
      "His mother, Penelope Hegseth, defended her son on the Fox and Friends programme on Wednesday morning after the New York Times published details of an email she wrote to him in 2018, accusing him of routinely mistreating women.",
      "\"I wrote that in haste. I wrote that with deep emotions,\" she said of the email, adding that her son and his first wife were \"going through a very difficult divorce\".",
      "\"He's redeemed, forgiven, changed. I think we all are after seven years,\" she said.",

      "Hegseth paid accuser to save Fox News job, but denies claim",
      "Who else has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "In addition to the accusations, some of Hegseth's past comments about how he might change the defence department have also raised eyebrows.",
      "On a recent podcast, Hegseth said the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff - the top military leader in the US - should be fired, along with any military leader \"involved in any of the DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] woke [expletive]\".",
      "He also has argued that women should not serve in combat roles because this practice had not made the military \"more effective\" or \"more lethal\".",
      "\"As we think about his comments that talk about DEI, it's yet another disqualifying attribute that he has,\" Representative Marilyn Strickland, a Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told the BBC.",
      "There is increasing scepticism about Hegseth's chances of getting enough votes to be confirmed by the Senate, CBS reports.",
      "At least four Republican senators would be likely to vote against him if they voted today, two sources told the news outlet.",
      "Republicans are expected to have a three-seat majority in the Senate, with 53 out of 100 senators, which must confirm cabinet-level positions in Trump's new team. Losing four Republican votes would be enough to sink Hegseth's nomination, provided Democrats and independents also vote against him.",
      "Hegseth is not Trump's first controversial nomination before he returns to the White House.",
      "Former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who Trump nominated for US attorney general, also faced scrutiny over allegations of sexual misconduct - which he denied - that were the subject of a congressional report.",

    "title": "Why Swedish women are quitting work",
    "published": "Thu, 05 Dec 2024 00:37:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Sweden has a reputation for strong gender equality, but some young women are giving up their jobs.",
    "story": [
      "Sweden has a global reputation for championing gender equality, so why are young women embracing a social media trend that celebrates quitting work?",
      "Vilma Larsson, 25, previously had jobs in a grocery store, a care home and a factory. But she quit work a year ago to become a stay-at-home-girlfriend, and says she\u2019s never been happier.",
      "\u201cMy life is softer. I am not struggling. I am not very stressed.\u201d",
      "Her boyfriend works remotely in finance, and while he spends his days on his laptop, she\u2019s at the gym, out for coffee, or cooking. The couple grew up in small towns in central Sweden, but now travel a lot, and are spending the winter in Cyprus.",
      "\u201cEvery month he gives me a salary from his money that he made. But if I need more, I'll ask him. Or if I need less, I don't - I just save the rest,\u201d explains Ms Larsson.",
      "She shares her lifestyle on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok, where she\u2019s amassed 11,000 followers. Some of her posts have had almost 400,000 likes, although she says she\u2019s not making an income from her content.",
      "She uses the hashtags \u201chemmaflickv\u00e4n\u201d and \u201chemmafru\u201d (Swedish for stay-at-home girlfriend and housewife) and describes herself as a \u201csoft girl\u201d \u2013 an identity that embraces a softer, more feminine way of living rather than focussing on a career.",
      "The soft girl lifestyle has been a microtrend on social media in different parts of the world since the late 2010s. But in Sweden \u2013 with five decades of policies designed to promote dual income households behind it \u2013 the concept\u2019s recent popularity has sparked both surprise and division.",
      "Ungdomsbarometern \u2013  Sweden\u2019s largest annual survey of young people \u2013 first put the national spotlight on Swedes embracing the soft girl trend a year ago, after it became a popular choice when 15 to 24-year-olds were asked to predict trends for 2024.",
      "Another study released by Ungdomsbaromatern this August suggested it was even becoming an aspiration among younger schoolgirls, with 14% of seven to 14-year-olds identifying as soft girls.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about leaning away from this \u2018girl boss\u2019 ideal that we've seen for a lot of years, where there are very, very high demands for success in every aspect of life,\u201d explains Johanna G\u00f6ransson, a researcher for Ungdomsbarometern.",
      "There is no official data on the number of young \u201csoft girls\u201d quitting work altogether and living off their partners like Ms Larsson, and Ms G\u00f6ransson says it is likely to be a small proportion.",
      "But it\u2019s nevertheless become a major talking point in Sweden, from opinion pieces in broadsheet newspapers, to panel discussions at Almedalen \u2013 a huge annual cross-party political event \u2013 and on Swedish public service television.",
      "Gudrun Schyman \u2013 the co-founder and former leader of Sweden\u2019s feminist party Feministiskt initiativ - says she\u2019s taken part in recent debates on the issue. She believes women living off their partners wealth is \u201cvery dangerous\u201d, and \u201ca step backwards\u201d for gender equality.",
      "Ms Schyman argues that young Swedes have been influenced by the country\u2019s right-wing coalition government, which collaborates with the nationalist Sweden Democrats party, as well as the \u201cbroader development\u201d of populism in Europe and the United States.",
      "She also thinks there\u2019s a lack of awareness about life in Sweden before it embraced policies designed to promote gender equality, such as heavily subsidised childcare and shared parental leave. \u201cYoung women today don't carry the history of how women had to fight for their rights - the right to work, the right to have a salary, and the right to economic independence.\u201d",
      "At the other end of the political spectrum, the Sweden Democrats party has been positive towards the soft girls trend.",
      "\u201cI think that people should get to decide over their own life,\u201d says Denice Westerberg, national spokesperson for the party\u2019s youth wing. \u201cAnd if you have that economic possibility to do that [live off a partner] then good for you.",
      "\u201cWe still live in a country with all the opportunities to have a career. We still have all the rights, but we have the right to choose to live more traditionally.\u201d",
      "Aside from ideological debates, discussions have focussed on the social and cultural factors that could be influencing young women to quit work - or at least aspire to a softer lifestyle.",
      "Sweden has a reputation for work life balance - most employees get six-weeks holiday a year, and less than 1% work more than 50 hours a week.",
      "Still, Ungdomsbaromatern\u2019s research suggests rising stress levels amongst young people, and Ms G\u00f6ransson believes soft girls trend may be an extension of recent global work trends such as \u201cquiet quitting\u201d, which encourages employees not to overextend themselves.",
      "Meanwhile, the Generation Z age group (the cohort born between 1997 and 2012) are making, and being influenced by, social media content that celebrates leisure time rather than career goals.",
      "https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct5znz",
      "\u201cWork doesn't really feature that much if you look at lifestyle content on social media today, it's much more about exercise and wellness,\u201d explains Ms G\u00f6ransson. \u201cAnd if that's the picture young people have of what a normal life looks like, then, of course, maybe you're not so excited about spending eight hours in an office a day.\u201d",
      "But perhaps the biggest talking point is whether the trend is a response to the limitations of Sweden\u2019s pioneering gender equality policies.",
      "Alongside Slovenia, Sweden has the highest proportion of working mothers in Europe, yet government statistics suggest women in heterosexual couples still do a larger share of housework and childcare than men.",
      "They also take 70% of state-funded parental leave, and are more likely to go on sick leave for stress. Meanwhile, although the income gap between men and women remains lower than the EU average of 12.7%, it has stalled at around 10%  since 2019.",
      "Ms Larsson \u2013 who wants to have children in the future \u2013 says her decision to become a stay-at-home girlfriend is partly due to watching older women struggle to juggle a career and homelife.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of women feel burned out from their work,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just think of my mother and her mother, my grandma, and my sister, everyone. They're always so stressed.\u201d",
      "At Sweden\u2019s state-funded Gender Equality Agency, Peter Wickstr\u00f6m, head of the department for policy analysis and monitoring, also believes the soft girl trend can be viewed as a \u201crational reaction\u201d to the perceived \u201cdemands\u201d experienced by young women.",
      "Shoka \u00c5hrman, an economist at one of Sweden\u2019s largest pension funds, SPP, says she does not believe enough Swedish girlfriends or wives will quit work for it to have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.",
      "However, she is working to raise awareness amongst Swedish women that leaving the labour force (as well as going part time) could impact their personal finances, from savings and pensions, to salary levels if they return to work.",
      "Ms \u00c5hrman hopes the current soft girl debates will serve as a wake-up call to both politicians and businesses alike that there is still work to be done to address ongoing structural inequalities in Sweden.",
      "\u201cI think the source of it, which is mental health issues, burnouts and all that, is what's more worrying, because that affects not only the few younger girls today that want to stay home as soft girls,\u201d she says.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 15:33:10 GMT",
    "summary": "UK drug gangs paid Russian criminals to swap their dirty street cash for untraceable cryptocurrency, police say.",
    "story": [
      "A multi-billion-dollar money laundering operation that formed when UK gangs were struggling to offload cash during lockdown has been uncovered by the National Crime Agency.",
      "Discovering the Russian-speaking network embedded in the UK\u2019s street drugs market is the biggest success against money laundering in a decade, say investigators.",
      "The global operation, based in Moscow, has been taking dirty money from crime gangs for a fee, and allowing them to exchange it for untraceable cryptocurrency, protecting drugs profits from detection. The network has also been used by the Russian state to fund espionage.",
      "The network stretches across 30 countries, and 84 people have so far been arrested, including 71 in the UK, the NCA and its partners told reporters at a briefing earlier this week.",
      "UK Security Minister Dan Jarvis said the operation \"exposed Russian kleptocrats, drug gangs and cyber criminals - all of whom relied on the flow of dirty money\".",
      "On Wednesday, the United States Treasury sanctioned the key figures at the top of the network.",
      "Ekaterina Zhdanova, the head of a Moscow-based cryptocurrency network called Smart, has been identified as being at the heart of the operation. She was previously sanctioned by US authorities in November 2023 for allegedly moving money for Russian elites.",
      "Bradley Smith, Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence for the US Treasury, said the country \"remains committed to disrupting any effort by Russia to use digital assets or other illicit financial schemes to accrue, store, and transfer their ill-gotten gains\".",
      "Rob Jones, director general of operations at the NCA, said the thread connecting Russian elites, crypto-rich cyber criminals and UK drugs gangs had been \u201cinvisible until now\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe have identified and acted against the Russians pulling the strings at the very top,\u201d he continued, adding that the NCA had now made it \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for the key players to operate.",
      "Clues found during pandemic",
      "The trail that led to the enormous and complicated network was spotted during the 2021 pandemic lockdown, as drugs gangs across Europe struggled to move piles of cash from street sales into the legitimate economy.",
      "That, in turn, made it harder for them to buy in more produce, such as cocaine from South America.",
      "The NCA says two cryptocurrency networks based in Moscow, known as Smart and TGR, offered a solution.",
      "Both were sitting on large piles of cryptocurrency from ransomware attacks. That\u2019s a form of online extortion in which a gang paralyses an organisation\u2019s computer systems until it pays a fee to regain control.",
      "TGR and Smart took the profits from those attacks and struck a deal with British drugs networks, giving them an almost instantaneous way of converting dirty street money into a useable asset.",
      "In return for taking on the risk of receiving the cash, the Russian-led network charged commission. Its network of couriers would launder the cash, pushing it through seemingly legitimate businesses like construction firms in the UK and elsewhere, or using mules to fly it in baggage to Dubai.",
      "Ultimately, the cash re-entered the economy as it was paid into bank accounts as seemingly legitimate profits.",
      "In effect, Smart and TGR were mimicking a legitimate bank, by charging a small fee for providing a network to move money from country to country.",
      "The first clue came when police stopped Fawad Saiedi, a drugs profits courier, in 2021. He was carrying \u00a3250,000 in his car.",
      "He later admitted co-ordinating the move of \u00a315.6m of dirty money and he was jailed for more than four years.",
      "As the NCA dug deeper, they found he had been working for Ekaterina Zhdanova, the head of the Smart cryptocurrency exchange service in Moscow.",
      "The NCA then detected an identical pattern around the country of links between people involved in the drugs trade and those involved in crypto. They also saw further links to the notorious Kinahan drugs cartel that has its origins in Dublin and a base in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).",
      "Drug profits couriers identical to Saiedi\u2019s operation were collecting cash from gangs after setting up a simple system to ensure they could trust each other and make the transfers happen quickly.",
      "As soon as the cash was confirmed as passed to a courier, the equivalent in cryptocurrency, provided by the Russian Smart and TGR networks, was sent to a drug gang\u2019s secret online accounts. That crypto in turn could then be used to buy cocaine in bulk from South American cartels.",
      "Investigators identified one group of couriers collecting cash from 55 different British locations over four months on behalf of at least 22 gangs - and signs of identical schemes elsewhere in Europe.",
      "Another UK-based courier network was run by Semen Kuksov, the son of a Russian oil executive. He and his associates collected more than \u00a312m in drugs cash in just 10 weeks to be exchanged for virtual currency. Last February, he was jailed for almost six years.",
      "So far, the NCA and its partners have seized \u00a320m in cash, relating to an estimated \u00a3700m in drugs sales - and the vast majority of the arrests and charges so far are of couriers like Saiedi and Kuksov.",
      "Rob Jones from the NCA said: \u201cIf you're somebody now wanting to move money from a drug deal, which has been responsible for real harm in the UK, you're going to think twice, because you don't know whether that courier has been compromised.",
      "\u201cYou don't know whether we're following them, and you don't know where those proceeds of crime are going to end up.",
      "\u201cWe are anticipating where this trade will go next, and we will be ahead and waiting.\u201d",
      "Sanctions and espionage",
      "Wednesday\u2019s US sanctions are the final stage in exposing the network, by targeting the people at the top.",
      "The US office of Foreign Assets Control said it had sanctioned the head of TGR, Russia-born Ukrainian national George Rossi, also known as Georgy, and his second in command, Elena Chirkinyan, a Russian national.",
      "Rossi has presented himself as being a legitimate businessman based in London, but his whereabouts are unclear.",
      "The US Treasury says Ekaterina Zhdanova and other members of the TGR network used cryptocurrency and British financial services to move \u00a32m into the UK to buy property for a Russian national, who has not been publicly named.

      "In the dark, early morning hours of 26 March, US transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg's phone rang - and he immediately knew he had a problem.",
      "\"If my phone rings in the middle of the night, it's not a good thing,\" he recalled.",
      "The Dali, a massive 948ft (289m) cargo ship had slammed into Baltimore's iconic Francis Scott Key Bridge, sending the 1.5-mile (2.4km) bridge into the cold waters of the state's Patapsco River.",
      "\"It wasn't immediately clear what we were dealing with,\" Buttigieg told the BBC in an interview. \"How many people had been impacted, and how much of the bridge had been destroyed.\"",
      "Six men, all members of a road crew working on the bridge, were killed in the incident, which left the Dali - still afloat - stuck under huge chunks of shredded metal and concrete. Another man was pulled from the icy water, seriously injured.",
      "A new documentary from BBC One - available on iPlayer on 5 December - reveals new details of the investigation into the crash, including a possible cause: a cable that shook loose, disrupting the ship's power supply and causing an initial blackout minutes before it struck the bridge.",
      "After that, investigators believe they discovered a lack of fuel pressure to the generators may have created power fluctuations that tripped breakers and caused the ship to go dark again, with no time to change course before slamming into the bridge.",
      "Lost power, a mayday call and the crash that brought down a Baltimore bridge",
      "Lost power, a mayday call and the crash that brought down a Baltimore bridge",
      "Previously unseen bodycam footage taken after the collapse shows first responders and officials struggling to come to grips with the enormity of what they faced in the confusing hours after the crash.",
      "\"Key Bridge is down. It was last reported that there are at least several vehicles in the water,\" an officer can be heard saying. \"And several people still unaccounted for.\"",
      "'A hell of a clean-up'",
      "In the aftermath of the collapse, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of debris blocked the Patapsco, a 700ft (213m) wide and 50ft (15m) deep and economically vital shipping channel.",
      "Recovering the bodies and removing the twisted, broken steel and concrete from the channel - plus moving the Dali - fell to a massive team including US Army, Navy and Coast Guard members, as well as Maryland authorities and specialist private firms.",
      "The woman who led the effort, Colonel Estee Pinchasin, the Army Corps of Engineers Baltimore district commander, said that she had \"never seen anything of that magnitude before\".",
      "\"Everything [was] mangled up on top and around,\" she said. \"You had these big, large spans that were just laying in the water. You see four-inch steel that's been bent... how can you even start to think about the force?\"",
      "The dangerous work of searching the debris field and determining which pieces could be safely removed - and when - fell, in part, to teams of divers who inspected both the ship and the destruction beneath the surface.",
      "Never-before-seen footage obtained by the BBC shows the difficult conditions they faced: jagged and potentially dangerous pieces of rubble and muddy, brown water, which often meant they could not see more than a foot or two ahead of them.",
      "\"There was no visibility. I kind of compared it to a metal jungle gym underwater,\" recalled Robyn Bianchi, the assistant salvage master for one of the firms involved, Donjon Marine.",
      "\"You turn off all the lights in the room and try tell me all the pieces of where they connect to that metal jungle gym. Oh, and by the way, the jungle gym is completely twisted and looks nothing like it did when it was built to perfection.\"",
      "What caused the crash?",
      "A preliminary report from the National Transportation Safety Board, or NTSB, found that two electrical blackouts disabled equipment ahead of the incident, and noted that the ship lost power twice in the 10 hours leading up to the crash.",
      "In the aftermath, NTSB investigators were tasked with determining what happened. Eventually, they discovered a loose cable, which it is believed may have caused a power surge that tripped two breakers and disrupted electricity.",
      "As the crew struggled to restart the engine, a second blackout took place, likely as the result of a pump supplying generators with fuel shutting down and not restarting automatically.",
      "The erratic generators may have created additional power fluctuations that trip the ship's breakers - a common occurrence faced by seafarers, but which mostly takes place in open waters.",
      "Sal Mercogliano, a maritime historian and former merchant mariner, said that the silence the sailors must have heard in those moments is \"the worst sound you ever hear\" on a ship.",
      "\"At that moment, you realise you don't have control of the ship anymore,\" he added. \"It is a nightmare... you have a very short period of time in which to restore power.\"",
      "In the Dali's case, it was already too late. The time between the ship losing power and striking the bridge, it was later determined, was about four minutes.",
      "Despite the destruction and loss of life, officials are relieved that the incident was not worse.",
      "On the night of the collapse, police were able to stop traffic, with the last car clearing the bridge just 40 seconds before it fell.",
      "\"Cars would have kept coming,\" Maryland Governor Wes Moore said. \"By the time the people driving the vehicles realised the bridge was gone, it just would have been too late.\"",
      "\"I can't tell you how many lives they saved,\" he added. \"Because the answer is countless.\"",

      "Now in the dying days of 2024, she is taking a gamble on whether French voters will see her as acting in the national interest in bringing down a weakened government because she objects to its 2025 budget that aims to bring down France\u2019s budget deficit from 6% of national output, or GDP.",

    "summary": "Life for women among the Amazon\u2019s illegal gold miners is harsh, violent, and can be deadly.",
    "story": [
      "Dayane Leite never wanted to become a sex worker but at the age of 17 her husband died of a heart attack and she couldn\u2019t pay for the funeral.",
      "Her home town, Itaituba in Brazil\u2019s northern Para state, is at the heart of the country\u2019s illegal gold-mining trade, so a friend suggested raising the money by having sex with miners, deep in the Amazon.",
      "\u201cGoing to the mines is a roll of the dice,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cThe women are seriously humiliated there. They may be slapped in the face and yelled at.",
      "\u201cI was sleeping in my bedroom and a guy jumped through the window and put a gun to my head. And if they pay, they want to own the women.\u201d",
      "Dayane successfully gathered the money for the funeral, and at the age of 18 she had her first child. For the last 16 years, like many women in Itaituba, she has been returning periodically to the mines to work as a cook, a washerwoman, a barmaid and a sex worker.",
      "She now has a family of seven to support.",
      "\u201cI'm not going to say that all the women in the city do it, but a fair share of them do sex work. So it\u2019s kind of normal. We don\u2019t really care,\u201d says Natalia Cavalcante, who became a sex worker in a remote mining settlement at 24. Four years later, after marrying the owner of a bar, she became the madam of a brothel \u2013 a job she only gave up recently, to look after her nieces in the city.",
      "Life in mining villages in the rainforest is harsh - most consist of just a dirt track, saloon bars and a church. But the miners themselves live even further out, in shacks made of wood and canvas, surrounded by snakes and jaguars, and in total darkness once the generator is switched off. Women working as cooks have to live in these camps, alongside the men.",
      "The miners appear in the village whenever they have found gold and have money to spend, Natalia adds. Sometimes they have to be persuaded to have a shower before sex, women say.",
      "Running a brothel is illegal under Brazilian law, but Natalia says she took no commission, she just employed bar staff and rented out rooms.",
      "Young women would contact her asking for work, and she sometimes lent them money for the journey, a seven-hour drive from Itaituba.",
      "Asked whether she had misgivings about involving other women in the work, she replied: \u201cSometimes I think: \u2018I\u2019ve been through that, and I know it\u2019s not that nice.\u2019 But then I think: \u2018The girl has a family, sometimes a child to raise. Many of the girls who go have one or two children.\u2019 So we accept it.\u201d",
      "Even before marrying, Natalia had made a lot of money.",
      "She now has her own house in Itaituba, a motorbike, and considerable quantities of gold that she sometimes received as payment for sex, two or three grams at a time. Her goal is to study, to become a lawyer or an architect.",
      "Some women in Itaituba, nicknamed Gold Nugget City, have set themselves up in business with the money they made, she says.",
      "But it\u2019s a big risk to venture as a woman into the violent and lawless mining settlements.",
      "While the environmental harm of the mines is well known, the human cost - which the UN says includes violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking - goes largely unreported.",
      "A dealer in precious metals told the BBC that the illegal gold from these mines would typically be relabelled as gold from a licensed mining co-operative, before being exported and turned into jewellery and components for mobile phones, or other electronic goods.",
      "The three largest customers of Brazilian gold are Canada, Switzerland and the UK. More than 90% of all exports to Europe are from areas where illegal mining occurs, according to the Instituto Escolhas think tank.",
      "It\u2019s not unknown for women to be murdered in mining villages. The dead body of 26-year-old Raiele Santos was found last year in the room where she had been living near the Cui\u00fa-Cui\u00fa gold mine, 11 hours\u2019 drive from Itaituba.",
      "Her elder sister, Railane, says a man had offered her money for sex and she had refused, so he found her later and beat her to death.",
      "\u201cA lot of women die on a daily basis, a lot of women,\u201d Railane says.",
      "\u201cI was born in the mines, I grew up in the mines, and now I'm afraid to live in the mines.\u201d",
      "A man has been arrested in connection with Raiele\u2019s murder, but has not yet been tried. He denies all the charges against him.",
      "The land covered by Brazil\u2019s illegal gold mines more than doubled in the 10 years to 2023, to 220,000 hectares \u2013 an area larger than Greater London. No-one knows how many women work in this area, or even how many illegal miners there are. The Brazilian government says the latter figure could be anywhere from 80,000 to 800,000.",
      "Under President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the government has taken steps to close illegal mines and to stop dealers buying the gold they produce, but high gold prices continue to drive many men to try their luck.",
      "Dayane wants to stop working in the mining areas because of the risks and the toll the hardship takes on her body, but she is planning what she hopes will be one last trip. Her goal is to earn enough in two or three months to open a snack bar on her return, though she realises she may not succeed.",
      "Whenever she is alone, walking in the forest, she will worry about her children, she says.",
      "\u201cI will keep trying, until I can\u2019t any more,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause I think that one day, my children will say: \u2018My mum worked so hard. She went through what she went through for us, and she never gave up.\u2019\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Namibia's governing party, Swapo, has retained its hold on power after more than 30 years, however its grip has been loosened - the latest African country where incumbents have had a difficult time this year.",
      "According to official results, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, the Swapo candidate, won the presidential election with 57% of the vote, becoming the country\u2019s first female leader.",
      "Opposition parties have refused to accept the outcome after the polls were marred by logistical problems and irregularities.",
      "Other important questions that have yet to be answered include how it was possible that Swapo increased its share of the presidential vote when in the parliamentary election it recorded its worst-ever performance, losing 12 of its 63 seats and only just holding on to its parliamentary majority.",
      "Swapo is not alone in suffering a major electoral setback.",
      "This year has been an \"annus horribilis\" for those governments in sub-Saharan Africa that have had to face voters at the ballot box.",
      "In almost every election held in the region this year under reasonably democratic conditions, the governing party either lost a significant number of seats or lost power completely.",
      "This trend has been driven by a combination of factors:",
      "the economic downturngrowing public intolerance of corruptionand the emergence of increasingly assertive and well-coordinated opposition parties.",
      "the economic downturn",
      "growing public intolerance of corruption",
      "and the emergence of increasingly assertive and well-coordinated opposition parties.",
      "The trend is likely to continue into 2025.",
      "One of the most striking aspect of the elections that have taken place in 2024 is that many have resulted in landslide defeats for governments that have previously appeared to have a strong grip on power - including in countries that have never before experienced a change at the top.",
      "The Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) that had ruled the country since independence in 1966 was crushed in October\u2019s general elections.",
      "As well as losing power, the BDP went from holding 38 seats in the 69-strong parliament to almost being wiped out.",
      "After winning only four seats, the BDP is now one of the smallest parties in parliament, and faces an uphill battle to remain politically relevant.",
      "There was also a landslide defeat for the governing party in Mauritius in November, where the Alliance Lepep coalition, headed by Pravind Jagnauth of the Militant Socialist Movement, won only 27% of the vote and was reduced to just two seats in parliament.",
      "With the opposition Alliance du Changement sweeping 60 of the 66 seats available, Mauritius has experienced one of the most complete political transformations imaginable.",
      "Senegal and the self-declared republic of Somaliland also saw opposition victories.",
      "In the case of Senegal, the political turnaround was just as striking as in Botswana, albeit in a different way.",
      "Just weeks ahead of the election, the main opposition leaders Bassirou Diomaye Faye and Ousmane Sonko were languishing in jail as the government of President Macky Sall abused its power in a desperate bid to avert defeat.",
      "After growing domestic and international pressure led to Faye and Sonko being released, Faye went on to win the presidency in the first round of voting, with the government\u2019s candidate winning only 36% of the vote.",
      "Even in cases where governments have not lost, their reputation and political control have been severely dented.",
      "Like Swapo, South Africa\u2019s African National Congress (ANC) retained power but only after a bruising campaign that saw it fall below 50% of the vote in a national election for the first time since the end of white-minority rule in 1994.",
      "This forced President Cyril Ramaphosa to enter into a coalition government, giving up 12 cabinet posts to other parties, including powerful positions such as Home Affairs.",
      "As a result, a region that is known more for governments that manage to hold on to power for decades has seen 12 months of vibrant, intensely contested, multiparty politics.",
      "The only exceptions to this have been countries where elections were seen as neither free nor fair, such as Chad and Rwanda, or in which governments were accused by opposition and rights groups of resorting to a combination of rigging and repression to avert defeat, as in Mozambique.",
      "Three trends have combined to make it a particularly difficult year to be in power.",
      "In Botswana, Mauritius and Senegal, growing citizen concern about corruption and the abuse of power eroded government credibility.",
      "Opposition leaders were then able to play on popular anger at nepotism, economic mismanagement and the failure of leaders to uphold the rule of law to expand their support base.",
      "Especially in Mauritius and Senegal, the party in power also undermined its claim to be a government committed to respecting political rights and civil liberties \u2013 a dangerous misstep in countries where the vast majority of citizens are committed to democracy, and which have previously seen opposition victories.",
      "The perception that governments were mishandling the economy was particularly important because many people experienced a tough year financially.",
      "High food and fuel prices have increased the cost of living for millions of citizens, increasing their frustration with the status quo.",
      "In addition to underpinning some of the government defeats this year, economic anger was the main driving force that triggered the youth-led protests in Kenya that rocked President William Ruto\u2019s government in July and August.",
      "This is not an African phenomenon, of course, but a global one.",
      "Popular discontent over inflation played a role in the defeat of Rishi Sunak and the Conservative Party in the UK and the victory of Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the United States.",
      "What was perhaps more distinctive about the transfers of power in Africa this year was the way that opposition parties learned from the past.",
      "In some cases, such as Mauritius, this meant developing new ways to try and protect the vote by ensuring every stage of the electoral process was carefully watched.",
      "In others, it meant forging new coalitions to present the electorate with a united front.",
      "In Botswana, for example, three opposition parties and a number of independent candidates came together under the banner of the Umbrella for Democratic Change to comprehensively out-mobilise the BDP.",
      "A similar set of trends could make life difficult for Ghana's New Patriotic Party (NPP) in Saturday's election, and will also cause the Malawian government of President Lazarus Chakwera major problems when general elections come around in 2025.",
      "If Ghana does see a transfer of power, sub-Saharan Africa will have experienced five opposition victories in 2024 - more than any other year in its history.",
      "That so many governments are being given an electoral bloody nose against a backdrop of global democratic decline that has seen a rise in authoritarianism in some regions is particularly striking.",
      "It suggests that Africa has much higher levels of democratic resilience than is often recognized, notwithstanding the number of entrenched authoritarian regimes that continue to exist.",
      "Civil society groups, opposition parties and citizens themselves have mobilised in large numbers to demand accountability, and punish governments that have failed both economically and democratically.",
      "International governments, organizations, and activists looking for new ways to defend democracy around the world should pay more attention to a region that is often assumed to be an inhospitable environment for multiparty politics, yet has seen more examples of democratic bounce-back than other regions of the world.",

      "On Tuesday night, at 23:00 local time (14:00 GMT) President Yoon, seated in front of blue creaseless curtains, made an unexpected address to the nation.",
      "He said he was imposing martial law to protect the country from \"anti-state\" forces that sympathised with North Korea. The embattled leader is in a deadlock over a budget bill, dogged by corruption scandals and investigations into his cabinet members.",
      "What followed was a sleepless night for Seoul.",
      "Shortly after Yoon\u2019s announcement, police lined the white metal gates outside the National Assembly building in the heart of Seoul, the building that the country\u2019s tourism authorities have framed as \u201cthe symbol of Korean democracy\u201d.",
      "The military then announced that all parliamentary activity was suspended under martial law. But neither that nor the heavy security presence stopped thousands from gathering in front of the assembly in concern and fury.",
      "It is easy to forget that South Korea - now a vibrant democracy - had its last brush with authoritarianism in the not-too-distant past - it only emerged from military rule in 1987. Martial law was last imposed in 1979.",
      "This was \u201ca move I never expected to see in the 21st century in South Korea,\u201d university student Juye Hong told BBC World Service's OS programme from Seoul.",
      "The scramble",
      "Soon after Yoon's shock announcement, the opposition's Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, hosted a live stream urging people to assemble at the National Assembly and protest there.",
      "He also asked  his fellow lawmakers to make their way to the assembly to vote down the order.",
      "Hundreds of South Koreans responded.",
      "Tensions rose quickly as a sea of dark, puffy winter coats pushed up against lines of police in neon jackets, chanting \u201cno to martial law\u201d.",
      "And as vehicles arrived with military units, crowds blocked them. One woman lay defiantly between the wheels of a vehicle.",
      "In stark contrast, there was a fa\u00e7ade of normalcy across the rest of Seoul. Still, confusion enveloped the city.",
      "\u201cThe streets look normal, people here are certainly bewildered,\u201d John Nilsson-Wright, an associate professor at the University of Cambridge, told BBC World Service from Seoul.",
      "The policeman he spoke to was \u201cas mystified as I am,\u201d he added.",

      "What is martial law and why was it declared?",
      "Woman who grabbed South Korean soldier's gun speaks to BBC",
      "How two hours of martial law chaos unfolded",
      "It was a sleepless night for some. \"At first I was excited at the thought of not going to school today,\" 15-year-old Kwon Hoo told the BBC in Seoul on Wednesday. \"But then overwhelmingly the sense of fear settled in, that kept me up all night.\"",
      "\"No words can express how afraid I am that things might turn out like North Korea for our people,\" a South Korean who did not want to be named told BBC OS.",
      "Meanwhile, word was spreading that special forces had been deployed to the assembly building. Helicopters were heard overhead as they circled the skies before landing on the parliament\u2019s roof.",
      "Reporters jostled in the crowd outside the gates, clicking away with their cameras.",
      "As concerns grew that the government might restrict the media, journalists in Seoul stayed in touch with one another, exchanging advice on how to stay safe.",
      "Ahn Gwi-ryeong, the 35-year-old spokesperson for the opposition Democratic Party found herself facing down soldiers at gunpoint. A video of the moment, where she is tugging at the barrel of a soldier's rifle, has since gone viral.",
      "\"I wasn't thinking about anything intellectual or rational, I was just like, \u2018We have to stop this, if we don't stop this, there's nothing else,\u2019\u2019 she told the BBC.",
      "\"To be honest, I was a bit scared at first when I first saw the martial law troops. I thought, \u2018Is this something that can happen in 21st century Korea, especially in the National Assembly?\"",
      "\"After such a storm last night, it was hard to get back to reality,\" she added, recalling the previous night.  \"I felt like I was witnessing the regression of history.\"",
      "As Ahn was confronting the soldiers, the clock was ticking for opposition lawmakers, who rushed to get into the assembly to block the order. Once that happened, the president would have to withdraw it.",
      "But first, MPs and their aides had to get inside. Some crawled through the legs of security forces, others shoved and screamed at armed soldiers; many frantically clambered over fences and walls.",
      "Hong Kee-won from the Democratic Party told the BBC that he had to scale a 1.5m (4.9ft)-high fence to enter the building, with the police blocking him even after he had shown them identification that proved he was a lawmaker.",
      "Hong said that protesters helped to hoist him over the wall. He had been asleep when Yoon made the announcement - when his wife woke him, he raced to parliament.",
      "\u201cDemocracy is strong here,\u201d Hong said. \u201cThe military needs to listen to us, to the constitution, and not to the president.\u201d",
      "The vote",
      "Lawmakers who made it into the building huddled together, only slightly calmer than the people outside. Hastily, they barricaded the entrances with whatever they could find: cushioned benches, long tables, sofas.",
      "Some tried to push back soldiers who had made their way into the assembly building.",
      "By 01:00 local time, National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-sik submitted a resolution requesting martial law to be lifted.",
      "With that, less than two hours after Yoon\u2019s shock declaration, 190 lawmakers who gathered, including some from Yoon\u2019s party, voted unanimously to block it.",
      "After the vote, opposition leader Lee told reporters that this was \"a decisive opportunity to break the vicious cycle and return to normal society\".",
      "By 04:30, Yoon was back on TV, in front of the same blue curtains, saying he would withdraw martial law. But this would only be made official, he said, when he could assemble enough of his cabinet to lift the order.",
      "The announcement was met with cheers outside the assembly. In the hours before dawn, more people emerged from the building, from behind the barricades they had haphazardly put together.",
      "With holes in the doors and broken windows, the stately building already bears scars of the night when South Koreans saved their democracy.",
      "Schools, local businesses and banks opened as usual on Wednesday morning - and  flights continued to land uninterrupted in South Korea's buzzing capital.",
      "But public anger - and the political fallout - was not spent.",
      "As the sun rose on Wednesday, thousands gathered to call for Yoon's resignation. The president is also facing impeachment proceedings.",
      "\u201cWe are a strong democracy\u2026But Korean people want to be safe - President Yoon must resign or be impeached,\u201d Yang Bu-nam, a Democratic Party politician, told the BBC.",

      "Listen to Fergal read this article",
      "Every single person in his platoon knew someone who was killed. Yuval Green, 26, knew at least three. He was a reservist, a medic in the paratroops of the Israel Defence Forces, when he heard the first news of the 7 October Hamas attack.",
      "\u201cIsrael is a small country. Everyone knows each other,\u201d he says. In several days of violence,1,200 people were killed, and 251 more abducted into Gaza. Ninety-seven hostages remain in Gaza, and around half of them are believed to be alive.",
      "Yuval immediately answered his country\u2019s call to arms. It was a mission to defend Israelis. He recalls the horror of entering devastated Jewish communities near the Gaza border. \u201cYou're seeing\u2026 dead bodies on the streets, seeing cars punctured by bullets.\u201d",
      "Back then, there was no doubt about reporting for duty. The country was under attack. The hostages had to be brought home.",
      "Then came the fighting in Gaza itself. Things seen that could not be unseen. Like the night he saw cats eating human remains in the roadway.",
      "\u201cStart to imagine, like an apocalypse. You look to your right, you look to your left, all you see is destroyed buildings, buildings that are damaged by fire, by missiles, everything. That's Gaza right now.\u201d",
      "One year on, the young man who reported for duty on 7 October is refusing to fight.",
      "Yuval is the co-organiser of a public letter signed by more than 165 - at the latest count - Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) reservists, and a smaller number of permanent soldiers, refusing to serve, or threatening to refuse, unless the hostages are returned - something that would require a ceasefire deal with Hamas.",
      "In a country still traumatised by the worst violence in its history, those refusing for reasons of conscience are a minority in a military that includes around 465,000 reservists.",
      "There is another factor in play for some other IDF reservists: exhaustion.",
      "According to Israeli media reports, a growing number are failing to report for duty. The Times of Israel newspaper and several other outlets quoted military sources as saying that there was a drop of between 15% to 25% of troops showing up, mainly due to burnout with the long periods of service required of them.",
      "Even if there is not widespread public support for those refusing to serve because of reasons of conscience, there is evidence that some of the key demands of those who signed the refusal letter are shared by a growing number of Israelis.",
      "A recent opinion poll by the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI) indicated that among Jewish Israelis 45% wanted the war to end - with a ceasefire to bring the hostages home - against 43% who wanted the IDF to fight on to destroy Hamas.",
      "Significantly, the IDI poll also suggests that the sense of solidarity which marked the opening days of the war as the country reeled from the trauma of 7 October has been overtaken by the revival of political divisions: only 26% of Israelis believe there is now a sense of togetherness, while 44% say there is not.",
      "At least part of this has to do with a feeling often expressed, especially among those on the left of the political divide, that the war is being prolonged at the behest of far-right parties whose support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu needs to remain in power.",
      "Even the former Defence Minister, Yoav Gallant, a member of Netanhayu\u2019s Likud Party, dismissed by the prime minister last month, cited the failure to return the hostages as one of the key disagreements with his boss.",
      "\u201cThere is and will not be any atonement for abandoning the captives,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a mark of Cain on the forehead of Israeli society and those leading this mistaken path.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu, who along with Gallant is facing an arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, has repeatedly denied this and stressed his commitment to freeing the hostages.",
      "The seeds of refusal",
      "The seeds of Yuval\u2019s refusal lie back in the days soon after the war began. Then the deputy speaker of the Knesset (Israel\u2019s parliament), Nissim Vaturi, called for the Gaza Strip to be \u201cerased from the face of the Earth\u201d. Prominent rabbi Eliyahu Mali, referring generally to Palestinians in Gaza, said: \u201cIf you don\u2019t kill them, they\u2019ll kill you.\u201d The rabbi stressed soldiers should only do what the army orders, and that the state law did not allow for the killing of the civilian population.",
      "But the language - by no means restricted to the two examples above - worried Yuval.",
      "\u201cPeople were speaking about killing the entire population of Gaza, as if it was some type of an academic idea that makes sense\u2026 And with this atmosphere, soldiers are entering Gaza just a month after their friends were butchered, hearing about soldiers dying every day. And soldiers do a lot of things.\u201d",
      "There have been social media posts from soldiers in Gaza abusing prisoners, destroying property, and mocking Palestinians, including numerous examples of soldiers posing with people\u2019s possessions - including womens\u2019 dresses and underwear.",
      "\u201cI was trying to fight that at the time as much as I could,\u201d says Yuval. \u201cThere was a lot of dehumanising, a vengeful atmosphere.\u201d",
      "His personal turning point came with an order he could not obey.",
      "\u201cThey told us to burn down a house, and I went to my commander and asked him: \u2018Why are we doing that?\u2019 And the answers he gave me were just not good enough. I wasn't willing to burn down a house without reasons that make sense, without knowing that this serves a certain military purpose, or any type of purpose. So I said no and left.\u201d",
      "That was his last day in Gaza.",
      "In response, the IDF told me that its actions were \u201cbased on military necessity, and with accordance to international law\u201d and said Hamas \u201cunlawfully embed their military assets in civilian areas\u201d.",
      "Three of the refusers have spoken to the BBC. Two agreed to give their names, while a third requested anonymity because he feared repercussions. All stress that they love their country, but the experience of the war, the failure to reach a hostage deal led to a defining moral choice.",
      "'People calmly talked about abuse or murder'",
      "One soldier, who asked to remain anonymous, was at Tel Aviv\u2019s Ben Gurion airport when news started coming in about the Hamas attacks. He recalls feeling shock at first. Then a ringing sensation in his ears. \u201cI remember the drive home\u2026 The radio\u2019s on and people [are] calling in, saying: \u2018My dad was just kidnapped, help me. No-one's helping me.\u2019 It was truly a living nightmare.\u201d",
      "This was the moment the IDF was made for, he felt. It wasn\u2019t like making house raids in the occupied West Bank or chasing stone-throwing youths. \u201cProbably for the first time I felt like I enlisted in true self-defence.\u201d",
      "But his view transformed as the war progressed. \u201cI guess I no longer felt I could honestly say that this campaign was centered around securing the lives of Israelis.\u201d",
      "He says this was based on what he saw and heard among comrades. \u201cI try to have empathy and say, \u2018This is what happens to people who are torn apart by war\u2026\u2019 but it was hard to overlook how wide this discourse was.\u201d",
      "He recalls comrades boasting, even to their commanders, about beating \u201chelpless Palestinians\u201d. And he heard more chilling conversations. \u201cPeople would pretty calmly talk about cases of abuse or even murder, as if it was a technicality, or with real serenity. That obviously shocked me.\u201d",
      "The soldier also says he witnessed prisoners being blindfolded and not allowed to move \u201cfor basically their entire stay\u2026 and given amounts of food that were shocking\u201d.",
      "When his first tour of duty ended he vowed not to return.",
      "The IDF referred me to a statement from last May which said any abuse of detainees was strictly prohibited. It also said three meals a day were provided, \u201cof quantity and variety approved by a qualified nutritionist\u201d. It said handcuffing of detainees was only carried out \u201cwhere the security risk requires it\u201d and \u201cevery day an examination is carried out\u2026 to make sure that the handcuffs are not too tight\u201d.",
      "The UN has said reports of alleged torture and sexual violence by Israeli guards were \u201cgrossly illegal and revolting\u201d and enabled by \u201cabsolute impunity\u201d.",
      "\u2018A fertile ground for fostering brutality\u2019",
      "Michael Ofer-Ziv, 29, knew two people from his village who were killed on 7 October, among them Shani Louk whose body was paraded through Gaza on the back of a pickup truck in what became one of the most widely shared images of the war. \u201cThat was hell,\u201d he says.",
      "Michael was already a committed left-winger who advocated political not military solutions to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But, like his comrades, he felt reporting for reserve duty was correct. \u201cI knew that the military action was inevitable\u2026 and was justified in a way, but I was very worried about the shape it might take.\u201d",
      "His job was to work as an operations officer in a brigade war room, watching and directing action relayed back from drone cameras in Gaza. At times the physical reality of the war hit home.",
      "\u201cWe went to get some paper from somewhere in the main command of the Gaza area,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAnd at some point we opened the window\u2026 and the stench was like a butchery\u2026 Like in the market, where it's not very clean.\u201d",
      "Again it was a remark heard during a discussion among comrades that helped push him towards action. \u201cI think the most horrible sentence that I heard was someone who said to me that the kids that we spared in the last war in Gaza [2014] became the terrorists of October 7, which I bet is true for some cases\u2026 but definitely not all of them.\u201d",
      "Such extreme views existed among a minority of soldiers, he says, but the majority were \u201cjust indifferent towards the price\u2026 what's called \u2018collateral damage\u2019, or Palestinian lives\u201d. He\u2019s also dismayed by statements that Jewish settlements should be built in Gaza after the war - a stated aim of far-right government ministers, and even some members of Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party.",
      "Figures suggest there is a growing body of officers and troops within the IDF who come from what is called a \u2018National Religious\u2019 background: these are supporters of far-right Jewish nationalist parties who advocate settlement and annexation of Palestinian lands, and are firmly opposed to Palestinian statehood. According to research from the Israeli Centre for Public Affairs, a non-governmental think tank, the number of such officers graduating from the military academy rose from 2.5% in 1990 to 40% in 2014.",
      "Ten years ago, one of Israel\u2019s leading authorities on the issue, Professor Mordechai Kremnitzer, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, warned about what he called the \u2018religification\u2019 of the army. \u201cWithin this context, messages about Jewish superiority and demonisation of the enemy are fertile ground for fostering brutality and releasing soldiers from moral constraints.\u201d",
      "The decisive moment for Michael Ofer-Ziv came when the IDF shot three Israeli hostages in Gaza in December 2023. The three men approached the army stripped to the waist, and one held a stick with a white cloth. The IDF said a soldier had felt threatened and opened fire, killing two hostages. A third was wounded but then shot again and killed, when a soldier ignored his commander\u2019s ceasefire order.",

And I also remember thinking, there is just no way this is the first time [innocent people were shot]\u2026 It's just the first time that we are hearing about it, because they are hostages. If the victims were Palestinians, we just would never hear about it.\u201d",
      "The IDF has said that refusal to serve by reservists is dealt with on a case-by-case basis, and Prime Minister Netanyahu insists it is \u201cthe most moral army in the world\u201d. For most Israelis, the IDF is the guarantor of their security; it helped found Israel in 1948 and is an expression of the nation - every Israeli citizen over 18 who is Jewish (and also Druze and Circassian minorities) must serve.",
      "The refusers have attracted some hostility. Some prominent politicians, like Miri Regev, a cabinet member and former IDF spokeswoman, have called for action. \u201cRefusers should be arrested and prosecuted,\" she has said.",
      "But the government has so far avoided tough action because, according to Yuval Green, \u201cthe military realised that it only draws attention to our actions, so they try to let us go quietly.\u201d For those starting their national service and who refuse, sanctions are tougher. Eight conscientious objectors - not part of the reservists group - due to begin their military service at 18 years old have served time in military prison.",

      "\u201cI strongly oppose them [the refusers],\u201d says Major Sam Lipsky, 31, a reservist who fought in Gaza during the current war but is now based outside the Strip. He accuses the refusers group of being \u201chighly political\u201d and focused on opposing the current government.",
      "\u201cI don't have to be a Netanyahu fan in order to not appreciate people using the military, an institution we're all meant to rally behind, as political leverage.\u201d",
      "Maj Lipsky is a supporter of what he views as Israel\u2019s mainstream right - not the far right represented by government figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister who has been convicted of inciting racism and supporting terrorism, and finance minister, Belazel Smotrich, who recently called for the population of Gaza to be halved by encouraging \u201cvoluntary migration\u201d.",
      "Maj Lipsky acknowledges the civilian suffering in Gaza and does not deny the imagery of dead and maimed women and children.",
      "As we speak at his home in southern Israel, his two young children are sleeping in the next room. \u201cThere's no way to fight the war and to prosecute a military campaign without these images happening,\u201d he says. He then uses an expression heard in the past from Israeli leaders: \u201cYou can't mow the lawn without grass flying up. It is not possible.\u201d",
      "He says the blame belongs to Hamas who went to \u201crandomly slaughter as many Jews as possible, women, children, soldiers\u201d.",
      "The imperative of fighting the war has postponed a deepening struggle over the future character of the Jewish state. It is, in large part, a conflict between the secularist ideals held by people like Michael Ofer-Zif and Yuval Green, and the increasingly powerful religious right represented by the settlements movement, and their champions in Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet, including figures like Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.",
      "Add to that the lingering, widespread anger over the government\u2019s attempts to dilute the power of the country\u2019s judiciary in 2023 - it led to mass demonstrations in the months before October 7 - and the stage is set for a turbulent politics long after the war ends.",
      "On both sides it is not unusual to hear people talk of a struggle for the soul of Israel.",
      "Maj Lipsky was packing to return to military duty on the evening I met him, sure of his duty and responsibility. No peace until Hamas was defeated.",
      "Among the refusers I spoke with, there was a determination to stand by their principles. Michael Ofer-Ziv may leave Israel, unsure whether he can be happy in the country. \u201cIt just looks less and less likely that I will be able to hold the values that I hold, wanting the future that I want for my kids to live here, and that is very scary,\u201d he says.",
      "Yuval Green is training to become a doctor, and hopes that a settlement can be reached between peacemakers among the Israeli and Palestinian people. \u201cI think in this conflict, there are only two sides, not the Israeli side and the Palestinian side. There is the side that supports violence and the side that supports, you know, finding better solutions.\u201d There are many Israelis who would disagree with that analysis, but it won\u2019t stop his mission.",

      "She arrives early for our interview. Fortunately, I\u2019d been warned it was a character trait and we were ready.",
      "The Vogue show offers audiences a series of vibrant chapters, narrated by Cate Blanchett, which tell the story of fashion and the runway.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite nostalgic to sit in the space and look at the incredible changes that have happened in fashion,\" Wintour tells me.",
      "We\u2019re treated to a series of the magazine's front covers from the early days, black and white footage of the first catwalk shows and images of the couture salons of the early twentieth century.",
      "Fashion then was \u201cvery elitist - you had to be invited and it was a very tight little world,\u201d says Wintour.",
      "Contrast that with the debut show by the musician and entrepreneur Pharrell Williams for Louis Vuitton in 2023. A pop-culture event, it was held on the Pont Neuf in Paris, with the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and of course Wintour in attendance, and got one billion views online.",
      "The democratisation of fashion means, as Wintour puts it, \u201cnow everyone can come to the party, which is as it should be\u201d.",
      "The exhibition also takes us back to 2017 when Karl Lagerfeld devised a space-station inspired runway set, complete with a rocket blasting off as models stood beside it decked in Chanel. Wintour told me it was \u201cextraordinary\u2026 and you couldn't wait to see what he was going to come up with next\u201d.",
      "Lagerfeld had form. Ten years earlier for Fendi, he had broken new ground, using the Great Wall of China as a catwalk, his models parading along the stone. Fashion designers of his stature clearly don\u2019t do things by halves.",
      "To insiders, Wintour has been one of the most significant players in fashion for the best part of 40 years - a maker of careers, an advocate for the power of fashion to meld with the A-list of entertainment.",
      "She\u2019s the driving force behind the annual Met Gala in New York, which sees the worlds of fashion and fame collide and go viral in a spectacle of outrageous outfits and celebrity appearances on the first Monday of every May.",
      "Those not on the inside are more likely to wonder just how closely Wintour resembles Miranda Priestly, the fictional tyrannical magazine boss from the film The Devil Wears Prada, whose portrayal by Meryl Streep is seared into the memories of fans.",
      "\u201cIs there some reason that my coffee isn\u2019t here? Has she died or something?\u201d Priestly inquires dismissively about her assistant.",
      "\u201cDetails of your incompetence do not interest me,\u201d she later tells her.",
      "On Wintour\u2019s trip to London, she leant in to the comparison, attending the gala performance of the new musical version of the film. There, she told the BBC that it was \"for the audience and for the people I work with to decide if there are any similarities between me and Miranda Priestly\u201d.",
      "When we spoke, I wanted to know if she finds the public persona of Anna Wintour - the sharp, bobbed hair, the meticulous outfits, the glasses - a role she feels she has to perform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about it,\" she says. \"What I\u2019m really interested in is the creative aspect of my job.\"",
      "Wintour tells me she only brought one or two suitcases with her to London and she won\u2019t be drawn on whether she dresses down when she\u2019s at home in the US. \"It\u2019s really about respect in how you present yourself.\"",
      "More than one person has told me that nobody ever says 'no' to Wintour. Donatella Versace says the same in the recent Disney documentary, In Vogue: The 90s.",
      "Wintour demurs. \u201cThat is absolutely untrue. They often say no, but that\u2019s a good thing. No is a wonderful word\u201d.",
      "Do you think people are frightened of you, I ask her. \u201cI hope not,\u201d she replies.",
      "Under her leadership, through talent, force of personality and an eye for what sells, Wintour has tried to future proof Vogue, turning it into a global brand. She is also global content advisor for Conde Nast, the magazine's publisher.",
      "In the modern era, when influencers can take photos of fashion moments and pump them out immediately, Wintour has successfully positioned Vogue as an arbiter of taste and style.",
      "Fashion and advertising are entwined in Vogue's content but Wintour doesn\u2019t accept my premise that fashion journalism can be sycophantic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s simply not true and it\u2019s sometimes, I think, frustrating to us that work in fashion, that there is an outside perception fashion is frivolous and superficial.",
      "\"In fact, it\u2019s a huge business. We give employment to millions of people around the world.\"",
      "I take that answer to mean that Wintour, the daughter of a former editor of the Evening Standard newspaper, sees herself more as a fashion ambassador than a journalist.",
      "But of course she is also a journalist, arguably one of the most famous journalistic faces on the planet - and one that has no obvious successor.",
      "I ask her, at 75, how much longer she plans to stay in her role.",
      "\u201cI have no plans to leave my job,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cCurrently.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ghanaians are about to elect a new president amid concerns about inflation, unemployment and debt.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana is heading for its ninth general election since multiparty politics resumed in 1992.",
      "In that time, there have been three peaceful transfers of power, with the two main parties \u2013 the National Democratic Congress (NDC) and the New Patriotic Party (NPP) \u2013 holding the presidency for a total of 16 years each.",
      "Here, in charts, are the big issues this time round as the NPP goes for an unprecedented third successive term in power.",
      "Ghanaians were hit particularly hard in the pocket by the global bout of inflation, beginning in early 2022, that saw prices rise in the country at their fastest rate for more than two decades.",
      "The annual rate of increase reached a peak of 54.1% in December 2022. It has since come down, but this is just an average and prices of some staples have continued to go up sharply.",
      "Eggs and tomatoes, for instance were more than twice as expensive in February 2024 as they were 12 months earlier. Other Ghanaian favourites have also shot up with wages not keeping pace.",
      "Although the popular national dish - Ga kenkey (fermented maize dumplings) with fish - has not seen such a big jump, the balls of kenkey are now smaller.",
      "As a result, more people have been pushed into poverty and living standards have suffered, the World Bank says.",
      "In 2022, Ghana defaulted on its debt repayments and was forced into lengthy negotiations with international lenders to try and restructure the loans, which are still on-going.",
      "Local lenders were forced into taking lower repayments.",
      "The government also went to the International Monetary Fund to get help with a bailout programme.",
      "President Nana Akufo-Addo admitted the country was in \u201ccrisis\u201d but blamed outside forces. The opposition and some economists said it was down to economic mismanagement by the government.",
      "The amount of money that Ghana owes its creditors has steadily risen for the last two decades, but there was a sharp uptick in 2019, and by 2022 the government needed more than 70% of its income just to service the debt.",
      "The country\u2019s economic difficulties have been accompanied by a steadily rising unemployment rate.",
      "Going back two decades, one in 20 Ghanaians able to work were unemployed - that figure now stands at one in seven.",
      "With more than half the population - some 24 million people - under the age of 35, young people have been particularly hard-hit.",
      "For 15-to-24-year-olds the unemployment rate is twice the overall figure, with nearly 30% without a job.",
      "The views of younger voters could have a big impact on the outcome of the election.",
      "As Africa\u2019s largest \u2013 and the world\u2019s 10th biggest \u2013 producer of the precious metal, gold plays a big role in the economy.",
      "Gold mining has become a major talking-point in the months leading up to the election, with complaints about the damage that small-scale and illegal mining is doing to the environment.",
      "But with the global gold price more than doubling in the last decade, the attraction of getting involved in the business is obvious.",
      "Gold is a big foreign-exchange earner for Ghana \u2013 in 2023, exports amounted to $5.2bn (\u00a34.1bn).",
      "Along with gold, the country has resources of oil, gas, diamonds, bauxite and lithium among other things.",
      "It is also a big player in the global cocoa market, being the world's second largest supplier of the vital ingredient of chocolate.",
      "These resources have transformed the economy over the past three decades and enabled the country to become much richer, with extreme poverty dropping by half in that time, World Bank experts have said.",
      "The average annual income per person has gone through a dramatic shift since 2005, with the standard of living showing a marked increase up to 2017.",
      "Since then, however, it has barely risen, except for a spike in 2021.",
      "At election time, politicians have to contend with the fact that voters tend not to take the long-term view but generally base their choice on whether things are improving in the short term.",
      "The last three decades have seen a series of closely fought and peaceful elections.",
      "As a result Ghana has often been held up as an example of an open democracy that has turned its back on instability and its own history of coups in a region where they are still an issue.",
      "In some cases, elections hinged on just tens of thousands of votes and despite occasional legal challenges, the results have generally been accepted by the losers.",

      "They described being treated with respect by HTS fighters and increased supplies of electricity and water - but also spoke of their fears at war returning to Aleppo and distrust that the former al-Qaeda-linked group\u2019s professed moderation would last.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been displaced by the recent fighting, according to the UN.",
      "Many interviewees requested anonymity for their own safety. Some details of individual accounts could not be verified due to the difficulty of reporting independently from Syria.",
      "Many people in Aleppo are scared of renewed fighting, the locals the BBC spoke to said. Air strikes by the Syrian government and allied Russian forces have already killed dozens, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group.",
      "One man told the BBC his main worry was the bombardment that he feared could hit the city at any point. He said he had stopped his family from even going to the corner shop.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re living in complete apprehension,\u201d he said. He added that the air strikes that have hit the city over the past few days reminded him of earlier periods in the war.",
      "Aleppo, most of which had been captured by rebels in the early years of the Syrian civil war, was retaken by Syrian government forces backed by Russia in 2016 after a gruelling siege.",
      "Since then, the city has mostly avoided direct warfare. The Syrian government claims credit for what it says is the ongoing reconstruction of the city, which until the war was Syria\u2019s commercial hub.",
      "But NGOs and independent journalists accuse the government of widespread human rights abuses there, including torture and killings of civilians and non-existent democratic rights.",
      "Abdulkafi and his father's reunion was joyful - but Abdulkafi said some of his relatives were afraid to be seen with him for fear of retribution were regime forces to retake the city once again.",
      "\u201cNineteen Eighty-Four is applied in Aleppo. Assad\u2019s image is on every building, streets, on every corner. He is controlling their minds,\u201d he said, referring to the George Orwell novel about totalitarianism.",
      "HTS was set up under a different name, Jabhat al-Nusra, in 2011 as a direct affiliate of al-Qaeda. It has since split from the group and claims to have moderated its ideology. Human rights groups accuse HTS of arbitrarily detaining and mistreating critical journalists and civilians, claims the group denies.",
      "Some in Aleppo remain fearful. One woman said people were \u201cconfused and scared\u201d following the rebel takeover. She said she hadn't left her house at first, but later went for walks and drives with her family after hearing that civilians were not being harassed by the rebels.",
      "\u201cEverywhere was relatively calm. But everyone looked scared and anxious, you could sense it in their faces and their reactions. No-one looked comfortable.",

      "\u201cThey said they would respect them and allow them to do whatever they want, as Christians and as Armenians.\u201d",
      "Mr Meneshian said Christians were suspicious of HTS promises, saying minority groups in Syria had previously been persecuted by jihadist groups which at first said they would not harm non-Muslims. He said many had grown used to Assad\u2019s rule, which was authoritarian but at least did not actively persecute Armenians.",
      "\u201cThere are precedents for Islamist militias initially not harming anyone, but afterwards committing crimes against minorities. Hopefully this will not be the case.\u201d",

      "Critics of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to lead the FBI have expressed doubts that he is qualified to lead the US government\u2019s principal law enforcement agency.",
      "Some also raised fears that Kash Patel, a behind-the-scenes figure in Trump's first administration known for his loyalty, aims to dismantle an apolitical federal security service and refashion it into a means of partisan retribution.",
      "\"Look, 99.9% of the bureau is made up of hard working agents who adhere to the principles of fidelity, bravery and integrity,\" Jeff Lanza, a former FBI agent, said. \"But he's said that he's coming in to just decimate the agency. How is that going to go well and how will that play into the morale of the agents who have to work under him?\"",
      "Trump selected Patel, an unconventional nominee and vocal critic of the FBI, because of his agenda to carry out a radical overhaul of the agency he's been tapped to lead.",
      "The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries.",
      "Former FBI and Department of Justice officials who spoke to BBC said the job is  difficult, and it would be nearly impossible for someone like Patel, who has limited management experience, to operate effectively.",
      "Gregory Brower, a former FBI assistant director and deputy general counsel who worked closely with the past two directors, called the job \"nonstop\".",
      "\"It's relentless. It's high stakes. It requires expert judgment, stamina, experience, and a strong ethical and moral compass,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "Who else is in Trump's top team?",
      "Just how big was Trump's victory?",
      "When he announced his pick for FBI director, Trump called Patel \"a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending Justice, and protecting the American People\".",
      "Patel began his career as a federal public defender in Miami before working as a terrorism prosecutor at the Department of Justice between 2014 and 2017. He then spent two years as senior aide to Republicans who led the House Intelligence Committee, reportedly fighting the investigation of Trump and Russian collusion in the 2016 election.",
      "When Democrats took control of the House in 2019, he was hired as a staffer on Trump\u2019s National Security Council. In February 2020, he became principal deputy in the Office of Director of National Intelligence - then led by acting director Richard Grenell.",
      "By November of that year, he had moved to the Pentagon to serve as chief ofstaff to Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller - a position he held until Trump left office two months later.",
      "\u201cKash Patel has served in key national security positions throughout the government. He is beyond qualified to lead the FBI and will make a fantastic Director,\" Alex Pfeiffer, a Trump transition spokesman, told the BBC.",
      "Those critical of Patel cite past FBI directors, many of whom worked their way up through the justice department or FBI for decades, as a better measure of the qualifications needed to lead the agency.",
      "\"It's certainly not like the backgrounds that we've seen other directors of the FBI and those who have overseen other similarly sized and important federal agencies bring to their jobs,\" Brower said of Patel's experience.",
      "Some pointed to former US Attorney General Bill Barr\u2019s recollection in his 2022 memoir of Trump's attempt to place Patel in a senior FBI position in his first term to stress the point further.",
      "\u201cI categorically opposed making Patel deputy FBI director. I told Mark Meadows it would happen \u2018over my dead body,'\u201d he wrote. \u201cSomeone with no background as an agent would never be able to command the respect necessary to run the day-to-day operations of the bureau.\u201d",
      "Since leaving office, Patel has promised in interviews that, if Trump returns to office, he and others will use the government to go after political opponents - including politicians and members of the media who he alleges without evidence helped overturn the 2020 US presidential election results.",
      "\"We're going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\" Patel told Steve Bannon, a White House chief strategist in Trump's first term, on the War Room podcast.",
      "\"We're going to come after you, whether it's criminally or civilly. We'll figure that out. But yeah, we're putting you all on notice\u2026 We're actually going to use the Constitution to prosecute them for crimes they said we have always been guilty of but never have.\"",
      "Trump said during his reelection campaign that he considers Patel\u2019s book - titled Government Gangsters - to be a \u201cblueprint\u201d for his next administration.",
      "In the memoir, which criticises the so-called deep state, Patel calls for \"comprehensive housecleaning\" of the FBI by firing \u201cthe top ranks\u201d.",
      "On a recent podcast, he said the incoming Trump administration intends to retain about 50 members of the FBI\u2019s Washington staff, and the remaining workforce would be put into the field. They would, in essence, \"close that building down\", he said, referring to FBI headquarters.",
      "\u201cOpen it up the next day as the museum to the deep state,\u201d he added.",

    "summary": "Villagers remain scarred a year after the military mistook them for jihadists, killing 85 people.",
    "story": [
      "An Islamic school teacher, Masud Abdulrasheed, is struggling to come to terms with the killing of his seven-year-old daughter in drone strikes by Nigeria's military during a religious festival in their large but sparsely populated village exactly a year ago.",
      "The military said the bombing was caused by \"a failure of intelligence\", leading the army to mistake the open-air festival in Tudunbiri for a gathering of jihadist fighters.",
      "\"The incident of December 3rd, 2023 was a great tragedy that shouldn\u2019t have happened,\" military spokesman Maj-Gen Edward Buba told the BBC. \"The armed forces regret that incident. And if we could bring the lives lost back, we would.\"",
      "Warning: This story contains graphic details which some readers may find distressing",
      "About 85 people were killed, including Mr Abdulrasheed's little daughter Habeebah, when unmanned drones dropped two bombs on the village in northern Kaduna state.",
      "\"The first bomb dropped on us at around 10 pm, close to a tree where women and children were seated,\" Mr Abdulrasheed recalled. \"We ran for safety, but moments later we gathered to help those injured and also called for help, but the second bomb was dropped and it killed more people.\"",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed described Habeebah as \"the most caring among my children\".",
      "\"She would always give me whatever gift she was given, even if I didn\u2019t need it,\" he told the BBC.",
      "The 36-year-old was one of the organisers of the annual festival, known as Maulud, held to celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Many of his students were killed in the tragedy.",
      "\"We saw dead bodies all over the place as if they were sleeping. Body parts were strewn around the tree branches and rooftops. We had to pack them inside sacks and buried all the dead in a mass grave.",
      "\"There is nothing more devastating than seeing people you invited for a celebration coming to meet their end. I am so heartbroken,\" Mr Abdulrasheed said.",
      "As the father of four spoke to the BBC, he sat his second daughter, Zaharau, beside him on a mat outside their home. He gently pulled up her top to show a wound on her stomach.",
      "Four-year-old Zaharau was hit by shrapnel. It took at least an hour to drive her and the other wounded to the nearest hospital in Kaduna city.",
      "Although she underwent surgery, her wound still hasn't fully healed.",
      "\"When my daughter and the others that got injured were at the hospital, they were well taken care of. We thank the government for that.",
      "\"But things changed after they got discharged, months later. The hospital has refused to continue with their [free] treatment. They keep giving us excuses.\"",
      "Walking around Tudunbiri, there is hardly a family not affected by the tragedy of that fateful night.",
      "Twenty-year-old Aisha Buhari lost three of her younger brothers. She survived, suffering an injury to her left arm that is yet to heal.",
      "Sitting on a stool, she cried and wiped her tears with her hijab as she recalled the last moments of her brothers.",
      "\"That night, I just finished talking with them and stepped away for a moment when the first bomb hit, only for me to see their dead bodies on the ground moments later,\" Ms Buhari said.",
      "\"When they rushed me to the hospital, I could not think of anything but my brothers. I cried so much.\"",
      "As Ms Buhari spoke, she paused to wipe the pus oozing from her wound.",
      "\"There was no house or farm task I could not do before the incident, but now I can\u2019t do anything properly. I depend on people to help with something as basic as washing clothes,\" she said.",
      "Kaduna state governor Uba Sani told the BBC that he would look into the plight of villagers like Ms Buhari.",
      "\"Thank you BBC for this information. I will personally go back to Tudunbiri, and if I find people that still need treatment, I will take care of it,\" he promised.",
      "\"The instruction I gave was that all the injured should be treated and none of them should be discharged until they are fully recovered,\" he added.",
      "Undeterred by last year\u2019s tragedy, the Muslim faithful in Tudunbiri celebrated the festival again this year, but held it two months earlier.",
      "The occasion also marked the inauguration of a mosque the authorities have built for them over the bomb site, as a form of compensation.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed acts as the mosque's imam as the previous one was killed in the air strikes.",
      "\"We are happy about the new mosque, but we can never forget what happened,\" Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC. \"Any time I come here, I always remember that day, and I feel depressed. As we celebrate this year\u2019s Maulud, we also mourn those that we lost.\"",
      "For years, Nigeria's military has been battling armed jihadists and criminals, who raid villages and kidnap people for ransom in parts of the north.",
      "This has led to an upsurge in air strikes aimed at targeting them.",
      "The Nigerian Air Force has obtained \"a multitude\" of new aircraft, the editor of Defence Web, Guy Martin, told the BBC.",
      "This included Chinese-built unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones.",
      "\"Chinese UAVs are cheaper, making them more accessible. Nearly a third of African countries have acquired UAVs, mainly from Turkey and China,\" Mr Martin said, pointing out that it was strikes from UAVs that caused the disaster in Tudunbiri.",
      "\"Intelligence failure, poor coordination, and inadequate operator training are some of the reasons for erroneous strikes. The rapid deployment of UAV technology often outpaces the development of proper training and engagement protocols for military personnel,\" Mr Martin added.",
      "Maj-Gen Buba told the BBC that the military had found itself operating in a \"challenging and complex\" operational environment.",
      "\"But we have grown in our equipment holding and in our deployments of more experienced commanders and troops,\" he said.",
      "According to consulting firm SBM Intelligence, the Nigerian Air Force carried out 17 accidental air strikes between January 2017 and September 2024, killing more than 500 people.",
      "\"One mistake is enough; when we see hundreds being killed in erroneous attacks, we should be concerned,\" Human Rights Watch (HRW) Nigeria researcher Anietie Ewang said.",
      "In response, Maj-Gen Buba said that rights campaigners should \"give us more credit for being more transparent, for working with the people, and for being more accountable for our actions, as was revealed particularly during the Tudunbiri incident\".",
      "\"We will do everything possible to ensure that this never happens [again],\" Maj-Gen Buba added.",
      "He said that two army personnel were being court-martialled over the incident and while the case was still in progress, the military had redeployed them and relieved them of their command.",
      "Both the federal and state government have also unveiled development projects for the village as part of efforts to show remorse for the deaths, with Sani telling the BBC that the construction of a hospital and skills acquisition centre was almost complete.",
      "\"We have been supporting the people of Tudunbiri, and we will continue to do that,\" he said.",
      "\"They are my people,\" the governor added.",
      "But in a cruel irony, more than 20 people in the village reported that their farmland had been confiscated for the projects.",
      "They include 50-year-old Hashim Abdullahi, who told the BBC: \"I am not happy because this hospital has taken my means of livelihood and I was not compensated. I have been rendered jobless and can\u2019t provide for my family.\"",
      "In response, Sani said: \"For the people that genuinely have land, the department of land in Kaduna is working with the head of the community to ensure that the right people are given their land back.\"",
      "Nigeria's Vice-President Kashim Shettima also visited the village following the killings, promising - in conjunction with the state government - justice and financial compensation.",
      "People were told they would receive 2.5 million naira ($1,500; \u00a31,180) for each person killed in their family, while those injured were offered about 750,000 naira ($500).",
      "\"It is a difference that authorities actually carried out compensation this time around, but there is a sense that it has been very arbitrary,\" Ms Ewang said.",
      "\"We need to see the authorities take much-needed action towards justice, accountability, and compensation for victims in all of the other incidents of air strikes where they have accepted it was an error,\" she added.",
      "Ms Buhari told the BBC that her family had received the 7.5 million naira for her three brothers who were killed, and she got 750,000 naira for her injuries - though this was not enough.",
      "\"I usually buy drugs at a pharmacy to dress the wound because that\u2019s all I can afford to do now. The hospital doesn\u2019t attend to us any more. Sometimes the pain would be very severe for weeks,\" she said.",
      "\"We hope the government will come to our aid again so that I can get proper care for my arm. I can\u2019t wait to use it again,\" Ms Buhari added.",
      "Mr Abdulrasheed told the BBC he had not received financial compensation for the injuries suffered by his four-year-old.",
      "\"I always feel worried when I look at her condition,\" he said.",
      "He said he had received the full financial compensation for the death of his seven-year-old, but no amount of money could replace her.",
      "\"Every time I visit the grave site, I remember those we used to live together with but now they are no more. I miss them all. I miss my daughter.\"",

      "Each year, J\u00f3zsef loses five or six of his herd to a wolf, or a bear. It\u2019s why he keeps 17 dogs.",
      "\u201cA good dog is the best tool a shepherd has, to protect his flock at night, and in the daytime too,\u201d the farmer says.",
      "On Tuesday, 45 years of strict protection for grey wolves in Europe came to an end, after conservation officials adopted EU measures to downgrade the animal's protected status.",
      "The news means that grey wolves will be moved from Annex II (strictly protected) to Annex III (protected) of the Bern Convention.",
      "This will remove many of the safeguards that have allowed the animals to flourish in Europe and means that from the beginning of March next year, each EU country will be able to set an annual quota of wolves to kill.",
      "The Commission argued that the number of wolves in the EU has almost doubled, from 11,000 in 2012 to over 20,000 today, and that they were causing too much damage to livestock.",
      "The Worldwide Fund for Nature  (WWF) has called the decision \"extremely disappointing\".",
      "\"Wolf populations have barely recovered after going extinct in most parts of Europe, and weakening their protection could jeopardise this fragile recovery,\" said the WWF in a statement.",
      "The organisation also accused the Commission of prioritising political decisions over science, saying the decision was influenced by \"personal reasons after Commission President Von der Leyen\u2019s pony was killed by a wolf in 2022\".",
      "Wildlife campaigners have argued that improved protection methods, including trained sheep dogs, would be a better solution than removing safeguards. They say that wolves keep down numbers of deer and wild boar, which damage trees and crops. Wolves also prevent the spread of diseases by eating sick animals.",
      "In the town of Baile Tusnad, in a valley near J\u00f3zsef\u2019s village, wildlife experts met recently to discuss large carnivores. Most, though not all, oppose the hunting of wolves and bears.",

      "Another argument against shooting wolves is that they hunt in packs of five to eight, usually a pair and their offspring. If the older wolves are shot, the pack fragments, making it harder for them to catch deer and wild boar.",
      "\u201cIndividual wolves are more likely to attack sheep and other domesticated animals,\u201d Mr Haring explains.",
      "Campaigners also pointed to a 2023 EU report, which states that only around 50,000 of Europe\u2019s 68 million sheep and goats are killed by wolves each year \u2013 0.065% of the total number \u2013 adding that the overall impact of wolves on EU livestock is \u201cvery small\u201d.",
      "Moreover, it says there have been no fatal wolf attacks on humans for 40 years.",
      "\u201cIf we expect countries like India or Indonesia to protect their tigers,\u201d says Laurent Schley, head of the Wildlife department in the Luxembourg government, \u201cand Africans to protect lions and elephants, then we as relatively rich Europeans should be willing to tolerate some wolves.\u201d Luxembourg is one of the few western European countries where no wolves have been sighted yet, Mr Schley believes it\u2019s only a matter of time.",
      "\u201cWe have very high densities of deer and wild boar, so the conditions for the wolf are there.",
      "\"Of course, if individual wolves or packs start killing too much livestock, or were to show aggression towards humans, we would have to draw the line. Human safety always comes first.\u201d",
      "But back on the mountainside, J\u00f3zsef says wolves are dangerous because \u201cthey\u2019re clever animals\u201d. He favours tougher legal measures to cull the predators.",
      "Bears approach through the forest, treading on branches and alerting his dogs, J\u00f3zsef says: if they break into the wickerwork enclosure where his herd stay at night, they will only grab one animal.",
      "If a pack of wolves get in though, they can kill dozens of sheep at a time.",
      "Last year, J\u00f3zsef\u2019s favourite dog, Moody, was killed by wolves, in broad daylight, as they moved from one pasture to the next. All they found was his bloodied pelt.",
      "The more wolves there are, J\u00f3zsef says, the more likely they will take his sheep.",

      "In the National Assembly, Barnier could count on his own conservative group and the Macronites. But this centrist bloc has been easily outnumbered by a left-wing coalition on one side, and on the other the populist right of Marine Le Pen.",
      "And when those two forces combine - as they will in Wednesday\u2019s censure motion - then the numbers are too much, and Barnier must fall.",
      "It is a crisis that has been waiting to happen, but was deferred till now by long procedural haggling over the 2025 budget.",
      "Shortly after taking office in September, he proposed a budget that promised \u20ac60bn (\u00a349bn) in deficit reduction - necessary, he said, to satisfy Brussels and get the country\u2019s finances back in shape.",
      "But because he lacked a majority, his budget was then disfigured by opposition amendments - from both left and populist right - which removed taxes and introduced more spending, thus changing its essential nature.",
      "After much parliamentary to-ing and fro-ing with the conservative dominated Senate, Barnier came back with a new text, or technically texts, because there is a social security budget as well as the overall budget.",

      "In October, the UN special envoy for Syria said HTS had carried out a significant raid into government-held areas, Russia had resumed air strikes for the first time in months, and pro-government forces had significantly accelerated drone strikes and shelling.",

      "The Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which was crucial in helping Assad push back rebels in the early years of the war, has suffered recently from Israel\u2019s offensive in Lebanon, while Israeli strikes have eliminated Iranian military commanders in Syria and degraded supply lines to pro-government militias there. Russia is also distracted by the war in Ukraine.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 16:57:15 GMT",
    "summary": "An act of clemency by Hunter Biden's father continues a tradition by American presidents.",
    "story": [
      "US President Joe Biden has issued a presidential pardon for his son Hunter, who was facing sentencing for two criminal cases.",
      "The move has proven controversial, since the outgoing president previously ruled out such a move. But he claimed the cases against his son were politically motivated.",
      "His use of his pardoning powers continues a tradition of presidents on both sides of the American political divide granting clemency to people close to them.",
      "What did Hunter Biden do?",
      "Hunter Biden was awaiting sentencing later this month in two federal cases.",
      "In June, he became the first child of a sitting US president to be criminally convicted - in a case relating to his gun ownership. He was found guilty by a jury in Delaware of three charges for lying about his drug use on a form when buying a handgun.",
      "He was also awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in September in a federal tax case that centred on whether he paid enough tax from 2016-19. The nine charges included failure to file and pay his taxes, tax evasion and filing a false return.",
      "He faced up to 25 years in prison in the gun case and 17 years in the tax case, though he was likely to get much shorter tariffs and to serve the two sentences concurrently, experts told the New York Times.",

      "Follow live reaction to this story",
      "President Biden's statement in full",
      "What has the president said in the past about pardoning his son?",
      "Analysis: Biden's pardon for son shows presidents now act differently",
      "Full story: Biden highlights 'miscarriage of justice'",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "The US Constitution decrees that a president has the broad \"power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\".",
      "In this case, the president's \"full and unconditional pardon\" is unusually sweeping.",
      "It covers any potential federal crimes the younger Biden may have committed during a period of more than 10 years from January 2014 to December 2024.",
      "That spans a period beyond Hunter Biden's tax and gun offences and dates back to the year he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father, then US vice-president, had a key role in US policy towards Kyiv.",
      "The wording of the pardon also makes clear that it covers any offence that the younger Biden \"has committed or may have committed\".",
      "The pardon represents legal forgiveness, ends any further punishment and restores rights such as being able to vote or run for public office.",
      "Although the pardoning power is considered broad, it is not limitless. For example, a president can only issue pardons for federal (national-level) crimes.",
      "The issue is relevant because there is a question mark over the sentencing of Trump in his hush-money case in New York. He will be unable to pardon himself in that state-level case when he returns to the White House in January.",
      "How many pardons have other presidents issued?",
      "There is a long-standing precedent of US presidents on both sides of the political divide issuing pardons - including to people close to them. This is the 26th pardon issued by Biden, a Democrat.",
      "In 2020, Trump, a Republican, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of his daughter Ivanka. Kushner was sentenced to two years in prison in 2004 for charges including tax evasion, campaign finance offences and witness tampering.",
      "And in 2001, Bill Clinton, pardoned his younger half-brother, Roger Clinton, for a cocaine-related offence that dated back to 1985.",
      "In both cases, the pardons were given to people who had already served a sentence. President Biden's intervention in his son's case comes before sentencing.",
      "Trump granted 237 acts of clemency during his four years in the White House, according to the Pew Research Center, comprising 143 pardons and 94 commuted sentences. Many were in a flurry before he left office.",
      "That number is significantly fewer than his predecessor Barack Obama, who during his eight-year stint granted 1,927 acts of clemency, according to Pew. These were 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons.",
      "Most of those who received executive clemency under Obama had been convicted of narcotics charges at the height of the so-called US war on drugs.",
      "One of the most controversial presidential pardons was granted by Gerald Ford to his predecessor Richard Nixon in 1974 - covering acts that occurred during the Watergate Scandal. It was described as an effort to heal the nation.",
      "What have Biden and Trump said about pardons?",
      "The day after he took office in 2021, Biden emphasised that he would do things differently to Trump. His press secretary told reporters that the flurry of last-minute pardons issued by Trump was \"not a model... for how President Biden would use his own power. He would use his own power far more judiciously\".",
      "Biden said after his son's conviction that he would not issue a pardon. In the statement announcing his U-turn, he acknowledged that he had pledged to \"not interfere with the justice department\u2019s decision-making\". But, he said, the younger Biden had been \"singled out\" and subjected to a \"miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Trump is among those who have attacked Biden for the move, calling it an \"abuse\".",
      "The incoming president asked whether Biden would also pardon supporters of his who were prosecuted over the US Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.",
      "Trump, who faced a series of legal issues while away from the White House, has repeatedly made the allegation that the US justice system has been weaponised against him and his supporters.",
      "He has promised to issue pardons of his own for those who rioted in Washington. But who exactly will be granted clemency, and whether pardons will extend to those convicted of the most serious and violent offences, is still an open question."

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 21:16:05 GMT",
    "summary": "The country's president has already shown he is prepared to go to brutal lengths to save his regime.",
    "story": [
      "The reignited war in Syria is the latest fallout from the turmoil that has gripped the Middle East since the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October last year.",
      "The attacks, and Israel\u2019s response, upended the status quo. Events in Syria in the last few days are more proof that the war gripping the Middle East is escalating, not subsiding.",
      "During a decade of war after 2011, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule survived because he was prepared to break Syria to save the regime he had inherited from his father.",
      "To do that he relied on powerful allies, Russia, Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. They intervened on his side against rebel groups that ranged from the jihadist extremists of Islamic State to militias supported by the US and the rich Gulf monarchies.",
      "Now Iran is reeling from severe blows inflicted by Israel, with US support, on its security in the Middle East. Its ally Hezbollah, which used to send its best men to fight for the Assad regime in Syria, has been crippled by Israel\u2019s attacks. Russia has launched air strikes in the last few days against the rebel offensive in Syria \u2013 but its military power is almost entirely earmarked to fight the war in Ukraine.",
      "The war in Syria did not end. It dropped out of the place it used to occupy in headline news, partly because of turbulence across the Middle East and beyond, and because it is almost impossible for journalists to get into the country.",
      "In places the war was suspended, or frozen, but Syria is full of unfinished business.",
      "The Assad regime has never regained the power it had used to control Syria before 2011, the year of the Arab uprisings, though it still kept a gulag of Syrian prisoners in its jails.",
      "Even so, until the last few days, the regime of President Bashar al-Assad controlled the major cities, their surrounding countryside and the main highways connecting them.",
      "Now a coalition of rebel groups, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), has broken out of Idlib, the province along the border with Turkey that it controls, and in only a few days since 27 November swept away Syrian troops in a series of \"astonishing\" events, as one senior international diplomat told me.",
      "Two days into the offensive, they were posting photos of fighters who had taken the ancient citadel of Aleppo, which had been an impregnable base for government troops between 2012 and 2015, when the city was divided between rebels and regime forces.",
      "The atmosphere in Aleppo seems calm after the rout of government troops. One photo on social media showed uniformed and armed rebel fighters queuing for fried chicken at a fast-food outlet.",
      "HTS has roots in al-Qaeda, though it broke with the group in 2016 and at times has fought its rump loyalists. But HTS is still designated as a terrorist group by the UN Security Council and countries including the US, the European Union, Turkey and the UK.  (The Syrian regime calls all its opponents terrorists.)",
      "The leader of HTS, Abu Mohammad al-Jawlani, has a long history as a jihadist leader in Iraq and Syria. In recent years, though, he has moved away from strict jihadist ideology to try to broaden the appeal of his group.",
      "The rebranding is also being used to attract support for the offensive, which HTS calls Operation Repelling the Aggression. That name, and its official announcements, avoid jihadist language and Islamist references.",
      "Neutral language, according to Mina al-Lami, the jihadist media specialist at BBC Monitoring, is designed to distance what\u2019s happening from the jihadist past of HTS and present the offensive as a joint rebel enterprise against the regime.",
      "Syrians are generally repelled by extreme religious rhetoric. As jihadist groups came to dominate the rebellion after pro-democracy demonstrations were crushed after the first year or so of war after 2011, many Syrians either stayed neutral or sided reluctantly with the regime because they feared the murderous jihadist ideology of Islamic State.",
      "The offensive led by HTS comes out of the splintered political landscape of northern Syria. Much of the north-east is controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a group led by Kurds and supported by the United States, which stations around 900 troops in the area.",
      "Turkey is a big player, controlling borderlands where it has deployed its own regular troops as well as the militias it sponsors. Sleeper cells drawn from the remnants of Islamic State sometimes mount deadly ambushes on roads through the Syrian desert.",
      "Reports from Syria say that the rebel forces have captured significant supplies of military equipment, including helicopters, and are pressing on towards Hama, the next significant city on the road to Damascus.",
      "Without a doubt the regime and its allies will be working to steady themselves and to hit back, especially with air power. The rebels do not have an air force, though in another sign of the way that unmanned aerial vehicles are revolutionising warfare, there are reports that they used a drone to kill a senior regime intelligence official.",
      "The renewed fighting in Syria is causing international alarm. The UN envoy to Syria, Geir Pedersen, issued a statement saying that \"the latest developments pose severe risks to civilians and have serious implications for regional and international security\u2026 No Syrian party or existing group of actors can resolve the Syrian conflict via military means\".",
      "Pedersen added that there had been \"a collective failure to bring about a genuine political process\" to implement UN Security Council resolution 2254, which was passed in 2015. That laid out a roadmap for peace, with the principle in the text that \u201cthe Syrian people will decide the future of Syria\u201d.",
      "The objective was a future shaped by free elections and a new constitution. But that meant Assad and his family giving up a country that they treated for years as their personal fief. More than half a million dead attest to their determination not to let that happen.",
      "It is too soon to write the Assad regime off. It has a core of genuine support. Some Syrians see it as the least bad option \u2013 better than the jihadists who came to dominate the rebellion. But if other anti-Assad groups \u2013 and there are many \u2013 rise up, his regime will once again be in mortal danger.",

It's all quite impressive, and even more so when you realize where she started.",

They take time to ask everyone they run into how their day is. And on top of it, they think everything through. They are wonderful people, and they've helped me grow up in a lot of ways.

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Since 1996, the New York City and Santa Fe-based disc jockey has hosted \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top-40 morning program.",
    "story": [
      "If the annual Jingle Ball at New York's Madison Square Garden is the Super Bowl of holiday concerts, then Elvis Duran is in the role of head coach. From introducing acts like Olivia Rodrigo, to mingling with pop princesses (\"Sabrina Carpenter, everyone!\"), and interviewing rock royalty like Cher, on this day, this Elvis is king.",
      "But he says being interviewed for TV is different for him: \"I'm not a camera guy, I'm a radio guy,\" he said.",
      "If you don't recognize his face, you may know his voice. Since 1996 the 60-year-old disc jockey has been host of \"Elvis Duran and the Morning Show,\" the country's most popular Top 40 morning program. \"I can't believe it's been 30 years, because it's been nothing but fun,\" he said.",
      "Every day, millions of listeners nationwide wake up to Duran and his crew dishing about music, pop culture \u2026 pretty much whatever's on their minds. \"I've been working with some of the same people for 25-30 years,\" he said. \"The energy with each other is what makes it work. I don't need to be the center of attention.\"",
      "With 70 markets across the country listening, Duran's a rarity these days \u2013 a nationally-known radio DJ.",
      "I asked, \"Growing up, I remember big-name radio DJs. Now it's kind of you and Ryan Seacrest. What happened?\"",
      "\"Radio isn't what radio used to be,\" Duran replied. \"A lot of radio companies gave up on personalities; they just wanted to play music, it's cheaper. That's not good for our business. So, I've done everything I can to keep personality on a radio show in the mornings.\"",
      "And it's Duran's personality that over the years has won him loyal fans, including some of the biggest names in pop music. \"Lady Gaga grew up dreaming of hearing her song on our show,\" he said. \"And when she walked into the room, she was sort of nervous. And I was thinking, 'Well, shouldn't it be the opposite way? It is Lady Gaga!'\"",
      "But it's everyday listeners with whom Duran feels a special bond. He said, \"We are in the friendship business. I think about you when you hop in your car in the morning. You're either leaving a house that may be full of turmoil, or going to a job with a boss you don't like. But I have you for 20-30 minutes, and I can be your friend.\"",
      "Duran fell in love with radio as a kid: \"I'd spend the night at my grandmother's house when mom and dad were out late, and I listened to the radio. And I became friends with this voice in the dark.\"",
      "He was just seven and growing up in McKinney, Texas. \"I didn't have a lot of friends growing up. I was a loner. And so, I found friendship through the radio.\"",
      "And so began his quest to become one of those voices. He even built his own transmitter, with a studio located in his bedroom closet. \"My only listener was the lady next door.\"",
      "Duran's first real radio job came at age 14. After dropping out of college, he spent a decade bouncing between markets across the country. \"Back in the old days in radio, you never unpacked, you never took dishes out of boxes, because you were always moving,\" he said. \"But you know what, I've been very lucky. I've been at Z100 since 1989. So, I'm doing okay.\"",
      "While his show is based in the Big Apple, Duran's heart belongs in New Mexico. As a kid, he visited the \"Land of Enchantment\" frequently. He says the quiet of Santa Fe is the polar opposite of New York City. \"Of course, I need that. Santa Fe is a magical place. And I think, in some ways, this city has kind of saved my life a little bit. It's good to be in a situation where you're forced to relax.\"",
      "Duran and his husband, Alex Carr, share a home here, not far from where they were married in 2019. But decades before their first date, they had a chance encounter \u2013 where else? \u2013 on the radio, back in 1998. \"I had him on as a contest winner once,\" Duran said.\u00a0 \"Jingle Ball tickets. How old were you?\"",
      "\"Eighteen,\" said Carr.",
      "\"Ooh, God!\"",
      "Duran often hosts his show from Santa Fe. Thanks to a home studio, his commute is short. \"Every morning at 2:30 a.m. Santa Fe time, I slither up this staircase, and here you go.\"",
      "I asked, \"Is the Elvis in New Mexico a different Elvis than the Elvis in the New York studio?\"",
      "\"Oh, absolutely,\" he replied. \"And everyone back in New York has said to me at one time or another, 'You're so relaxed out there. We really like the New Mexico Elvis.'\"",
      "Duran can't say how long he'll keep broadcasting (\"To be able to do this this long, with this family, it's a miracle, it really is\"), but he isn't ready to mute his microphone just yet. He's still got a lot of friends to keep company.",
      "Asked how much this goes back to the seven-year-old Elvis listening to that voice on the radio, Duran replied, \"All of it. You know, I'm not lonely anymore. I never, ever want to go back to being a lonely person ever again. And I don't want anyone listening to our show to be lonely. That's the legacy we're all trying to leave. I don't want them to remember my name; I just want them to remember how we made them feel every day. That's it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 09:24:56 -0500",
    "summary": "It was in the chaos of a kitchen where the chef, restaurateur and TV cooking judge (and author of the new cookbook-memoir, \"Why I Cook\") learned how to be himself.",
    "story": [
      "When you find yourself at the farmer's market next to a guy with strong opinions about fennel and scallions, you listen. That's especially true if the guy is Tom Colicchio, who for more than 20 seasons has been a judge on one of America's biggest food shows, \"Top Chef,\" while also working as one of America's most successful restaurateurs.",
      "Many of his celebrated dishes have started at a local greenmarket in New York City's Union Square, but lately the meals he enjoys the most are even more local than these ingredients. \"I cook very simply at home,\" he said. \"It's not the food part of it. I enjoy the half an hour, 45 minutes that we're sitting together as a family.\"",
      "Now 62, married and a father of three, Colicchio is sharing the story of his many lives in the kitchen in a new book, \"Why I Cook\" (Artisan).",
      "So, why does he cook? \"Partly it was something that I found at a very young age that I was good at,\" he said. \"It came very easy.\"",
      "Thomas Patrick Colicchio grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, sharing a bedroom with two brothers, and big boisterous family meals in a working-class Italian neighborhood. While mom ran the family kitchen, it was dad, a gambler-turned-corrections officer, who helped turn Tom into a chef. \"Having ADHD, I struggled with recipes; I'd get frustrated by recipes,\" Colicchio said. \"But I loved cooking. And my dad wasn't the kind of dad who sat down and had these long conversations with you about your future. But he came home with these books \u2013 I had no idea what 'La Technique' was doing in a county jail library, but there it was!\"",
      "Yes, Jacques Pepin's \"La Technique\" is what helped Colicchio understand the fundamentals of cooking. \"Once I understood that, I could look at a recipe and go, 'Oh, they want me to roast something here. I know how to roast something. So, I don't need a recipe anymore,'\" he said. \"Or I can braise something. But now when I braise it, well, I can change the flavor profile by adding different things into that braise.\"",
      "The kitchen, however, was where Colicchio learned how to be himself, a place where in the chaos of orders and ingredients, he found a calling.",
      "His career took off fast, from flipping burgers at a local snack bar, to building whole menus at a North New Jersey hot spot, and ultimately to New York City, where \u2013 not yet 30 \u2013 he earned his first three-star review from The New York Times, at Mondrian.",
      "Colicchio doesn't credit his family for his entrepreneurial spirit: \"I think it came from the fact that I worked in kitchens and worked in restaurants that I didn't like. And I didn't want to have a boss.\"",
      "But even as he soared professionally \u2013 becoming executive chef at New York's celebrated Gramercy Tavern - Colicchio's private life was cruising toward rock-bottom. \"I was doing drugs when I was cooking the whole time,\" he said. \"Had a bad night and ended up in Harlem somewhere, you know, with another cook getting a bunch of drugs and, you know, getting high all night. I woke up in my bed \u2026 my shirt was covered in blood. I don't remember getting home, which kind of scared me, 'cause I was driving a motorcycle. So, somehow I made it home. But that was it. I woke up and said, 'That's it. No more.'\"",
      "He quit the drugs, but his working-class roots still led to some awkward moments in the Frenchified, fancy world of fine dining. \"I knew I could hold my own, but I just still felt like I was a fish out of water here,\" he said. \"Now I'm in New York. You know, you get three stars, now all of a sudden you're getting pulled in a lot of different directions. Was there a certain amount of impostor syndrome? Absolutely.\"",
      "He said he tried saying no to \"Top Chef\" (\"Didn't really love food TV\"), but then he had the experience of attending a food festival: \"Come time to sign books, and I'm sitting next to Bobby Flay, and he's signing 300 and I'm signing 20. I didn't think it was because he had a better book. He was on TV. It was like, 'All right, let me do this TV thing.'\"",
      "Looking back now, in his new book, Colicchio traces the arc of a changing industry, where sexism and even abuse has been replaced by something a little kinder, and a lot more welcoming. \"There's still voices being raised,\" he said. \"It's a little different than it used to be, but there's still, you know, in the middle of service there were times you got to be forceful. But you can be sure it's not personal. What's really missing is a lot of the misogyny that I saw.\"",
      "But for Tom Colicchio, after all these years, the one thing that hasn't changed is the one thing that also keeps him in the kitchen: \"Looking back on it, food has the power to bring people around a table. And to this day, I love doing dinner parties, love having people over. That's another reason why I cook.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 03 Dec 2024 16:29:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Levels of both the flu and COVID viruses are still low across much of the country, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "This year's winter surge of influenza and COVID-19 has yet to arrive for most of the country, data published this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows, with trends so far a fraction of what they were at this time last year.",
      "\"COVID-19 activity remains low and is stable in most areas. Seasonal influenza activity is increasing slightly among children but remains low nationally,\" the CDC said this week, in its weekly report on data about the two viruses.",
      "The agency's updates are usually published every week by Friday, but were delayed until after the weekend because of the Thanksgiving holiday.",
      "A return to normal for flu?",
      "By this time last year, data tracking outpatient visits to places like emergency rooms and doctor's offices for the flu had already climbed above the agency's baseline for the season. This year's latest report suggests flu cases are only now starting to cross that threshold.",
      "\"We're maybe slightly later than last year, and maybe quite a bit later than the year before, but those years were unusually early,\" said University of North Carolina epidemiology professor Justin Lessler, a top expert in the CDC-backed network of disease forecasters.",
      "Lessler said this year's figures look \"much closer to about where you'd expect a normal flu season to be\" before the COVID-19 pandemic, when measures to curb the outbreak scrambled seasonal patterns of flu and other respiratory germs.",
      "Compared with last year, rates of weekly flu hospitalizations are around five times lower. Emergency room visits with flu from school-age kids have accelerated, the CDC's data shows, but remain less than a third of what they were at this time last year.",
      "One big factor that could be affecting the figures this year is immunity in the population from the last two waves of influenza, alongside vaccination.",
      "\"We have had two fairly substantial seasons, which could be driving this delay. Of course the question is, does that mean we're having a delay, or a milder season. That's really kind of uncertain at this point,\" said epidemiologist Shaun Truelove, associate scientist at Johns Hopkins University's public health school.",
      "Modeling of this year's flu season gathered from different experts make different assumptions about what the country's flu immunity looks like, as they try to play out different scenarios of how this year's flu season might look like.",
      "Truelove, who also helps lead the CDC-funded disease forecasting network, also thinks that this year could mark a \"return to normal\" for flu.",
      "\"That being said, flu is never consistent. We get early seasons and late seasons. So it's hard to say exactly what that means, and everything's a bit weird post-pandemic, in terms of scale and timing,\" said Truelove.",
      "Watching for another COVID-19 wave",
      "Several COVID-19 trends that the CDC tracks also remain below what was recorded at this time in 2023. This is a contrast with previous summer waves of the virus, which have only dipped slightly into the fall before picking up again during the winter.",
      "COVID-19 emergency room visits are \"low\" or \"minimal\" in nearly all states, after this year's late summer wave of the virus. Levels of the virus in wastewater are \"minimal\" in all regions, compared to \"high\" levels around this time last year.",
      "\"Does that mean that there was enough immunity built up in that summer wave that we're going to not see a winter wave? Does it mean the winter wave is going to come, but be a little bit later and maybe a little smaller,\" said Lessler.",
      "Both Truelove and Lessler said one major \"data gap\" making comparisons to previous seasons challenging has been the lapse in nationwide COVID-19 hospitalization data during the summer surge.",
      "A pandemic-era emergency requirement for health care providers to report COVID-19 hospitalizations lapsed earlier this year, and only recently resumed under a new rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Other factors muddying the figures include changes to how people test and seek care for COVID-19 infections.",
      "Another big unknown is the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Most circulating variants right now are a medley of closely related variants like XEC and KP.3.1.1.",
      "\"We don't know, like we do for flu, what the average pace of COVID's evolution away from our immune system will be, when it settles down,\" Lessler said.",
      "Early data released last month by researchers at The Ohio State University found XEC looked to be more infectious compared with the parent variant it shares upstream with KP.3.1.1, but not significantly more than its siblings.",
      "\"I actually have thought it had settled down a bit, after this year. We'll see what I think after the season's done. But right now, I'm a little less sure,\" he said.",
      "Other respiratory germs on the rise",
      "While COVID-19 and flu remain at unusually low levels nationwide, rates of at least other germs that spread through coughs and sneezes remain elevated.",

      "Cases in this year's wave of pertussis, or whooping cough, are also continuing to accelerate in several states around the country.",
      "The agency tallied 577 infections of pertussis nationwide for the week ending Nov. 23, around 33% higher than last week's count. That's higher than the peak of 2014's record pertussis wave, which reached 326 weekly infections reported in late December.",
      "Ohio remains the state with the most cases of whooping cough this past week, after 66 infections with pertussis were reported.",
      "The CDC's \"acute respiratory illness\" metric, which lumps together levels of patients showing up in emergency rooms with a broad array of cough and cold illnesses including influenza and whooping cough, tallies 14 states with \"moderate\" levels including Ohio.",

    "story": [
      "Federal investigators found nearly a dozen children to be working dangerous, overnight shifts at Seaboard Triumph Foods' pork processing plant in Sioux City, Iowa, the Department of Labor announced.",
      "Employed by Guymon, Oklahoma-based sanitation contractor Qvest, 11 kids allegedly used corrosive cleaners to sanitize head splitters, jaw pullers, bandsaws, neck clippers and other equipment at the Seaboard Triumph Foods facility from at least September 2019 through September 2023, the DOL stated in a news release\u00a0on Friday.",
      "Federal law\u00a0prohibits\u00a0minors from working in meat processing due to an increased risk of injury.",
      "Seaboard Foods is among the nation's biggest pork producers. In addition to Iowa, Seaboard Foods, a division of Seaboard Corporation, has operations in Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah, and in Mexico, according to the company's website.",
      "\"These findings illustrate Seaboard Triumph Foods' history of children working illegally in their Sioux City facility since at least September 2019. Despite changing sanitation contractors, children continued to work in dangerous occupations at this facility,\" Michael Lazzeri, the Midwest regional administrator with the DOL's Wage and Hour division, stated in the release.",
      "Qvest must pay $171,919 in child labor civil monetary penalties and take steps to prevent it from illegally hiring minors again.",
      "Qvest and Seaboard did not return requests for comment.",
      "Still, children under 18 illegally employed in dangerous jobs in meat and poultry slaughtering and processing operations is not unique in the industry or to the Seaboard Foods plant in Sioux Falls.",
      "Seaboard in September 2023 contracted Fayette Janitorial Services for sanitation work at its facility. After taking over the plant's sanitation services contract, Fayette allegedly rehired some of the children previously employed by Qvest, with the Somerville, Tennessee-based contractor earlier this year found to be employing nine minors at the Sioux City plant, the DOL alleged.",
      "Fayette also allegedly hired 15 children as young as 13 at a Perdue Farms processing plant in Accomac, Virginia, where a 14-year-old was severely injured. Perdue terminated its contract with Fayette before the DOL's court filing, the company said.",
      "Are migrant kids cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses?",
      "The development is part of an ongoing probe into whether migrant kids are cleaning U.S. slaughterhouses. It also comes less than a year after the government fined another sanitation services provider $1.5 million for employing more than 100 kids \u2014 \u00a0ages 13 to 17\u00a0\u2014 at 13 meat processing plants in eight states.",
      "The DOL launched its investigation after a published report detailed migrant kids working overnight for contractors in poultry processing facilities on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. A New York Times Magazine\u00a0story\u00a0last December detailed children cleaning blood, grease and feathers from equipment with acid and pressure hoses.",
      "The Times'\u00a0account\u00a0included details of a 14-year-old boy who was maimed while cleaning a conveyor belt in a deboning area at a Perdue slaughterhouse in rural Virginia. The eighth grader was among thousands of Mexican and Central American children who have crossed the border on their own to work in dangerous jobs.",
      "But it's not only migrant children tasked with illegal and dangerous work. A 16-year-old high school student, Michael Schuls, died last summer after getting\u00a0trapped in a machine at a Wisconsin sawmill.",
      "From an elevated waterslide at a Jacksonville, Florida, beach park to a sawmill in Clarkrange, Tennessee, federal investigators are finding children across the country working illegal hours and performing risky, unlawful tasks. In May, federal investigators found a 13-year-old girl allegedly working up to 60 hours a week on an assembly line in Luverne, Alabama.",
      "More recently, the DOL found a Grand Rapids, Michigan, window cleaning company had illegally hired three kids to clean residential windows and gutters, and to install Christmas lights, with one requiring surgery after suffering serious injuries after falling from a roof. Another DOL case resolved last month involved children operating and cleaning a meat grinder and driving motor vehicles to deliver orders for a pizza restaurant in Iron River, Wisconsin.",
      "The DOL's Wage and Hour division oversaw 736 investigations uncovering child labor violations affecting 4,030 children in fiscal 2024, the agency stated.",
      "In addition to the federal government, the state of Massachusetts recently took aim at companies violating child labor laws, citing an operator of dozens of Burger King franchise locations across the state for allegedly scheduling minors to work more than the legally allowed hours. Separately, Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell reached a settlement with a New Jersey-based owner of Popeyes franchises across Massachusetts to resolve similar allegations, her office stated last week.",

      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile.

      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",

      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",

      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",

      "In October, the Social Security Administration set its 2025\u00a0cost-of-living adjustment at 2.5%, the smallest annual COLA hike since 2021. The COLA is based on recent inflation rates, and because price hikes have cooled from their pandemic high, seniors are getting a smaller benefit increase for the next year.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",
      "Amazon Prime two-day delivery",
      "Last year, the rest of the city's Prime members received packages within two days of checkout 75% of the time, but those in the impacted ZIP codes received their orders within two days just 24% of the time, according to the suit.",
      "Amazon dismissed as \"categorically false\" claims that its business practices are discriminatory or deceptive.",
      "\"We want to be able to deliver as fast as we possibly can to every ZIP code across the country, however, at the same time we must put the safety of delivery drivers first,\" an Amazon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"In the ZIP codes in question, there have been specific and targeted acts against drivers delivering Amazon packages. We made the deliberate choice to adjust our operations, including delivery routes and times, for the sole reason of protecting the safety of drivers.\"",
      "The company said it's clear with customers about expected delivery dates. \"And we're always transparent with customers during the shopping journey and checkout process about when, exactly, they can expect their orders to arrive,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Amazon would like to work with the attorney general's office to reduce crime and improve safety in those areas, the spokesperson stated. \"Nevertheless, we will proceed in the process and demonstrate that providing fast and accurate delivery times and prioritizing the same of customers and delivery partners are not mutually exclusive.\"",
      "The lawsuit is not the first time Amazon has been accused of providing discriminatory service.",
      "A Bloomberg analysis in 2016 found that Amazon excluded predominantly black ZIP codes to varying degrees from same-day delivery in six major cites. Amazon at the time said the issue had nothing to do with race.",

      "The Department of Labor is proposing to phase out a controversial Depression-era program that lets some employers pay disabled workers less than the federal minimum wage.",
      "Federal law currently allows the agency to issue certificates that let employers pay certain workers less than the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour based on the notion that their disabilities hinder productivity. Intended to help those with disabilities gain employment, the law currently has about 40,000 American workers laboring for half the minimum wage or less, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"Many earn less than half, some earn just pennies on the dollar,\" Taryn Williams, assistant secretary of labor for disability employment, said at a Tuesday news briefing.",
      "The agency has issued a proposed rule that would immediately stop the issuance of certificates that let employers pay less than the federal minimum and start a three-year phase-out period for the hundreds of employers that currently hold the permits.",
      "The Labor Department's proposal follows a review of the program, and the new rule would not take effect until a public comment period ends on Jan. 17, 2025, days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The new administration could review and respond to the comments and issue a final rule, or withdraw it entirely.",
      "Still, even if the proposal is not enacted, subminimum pay for those with disabilities could become a thing of the past, as more than a dozen states and the District of Columbia have already banned the program.

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

The new Enron website includes the kind of blandly uplifting videos often favored by corporate PR departments, such as a ballerina at the beach and a rocket launch, with a voice over talking about \"rebirth\" and accepting change.",

      "The College Company is run by Connor Gaydos, whose LinkedIn account now identifies him as the CEO of Enron.

    "title": "Amazon trucking contractors have higher rates of safety violations, CBS News finds",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 20:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Contracted truckers hauling packages between Amazon facilities are more likely to engage in dangerous behavior on the roads than other carriers, according to federal data analyzed by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The death of a 19-year-old college student on a Texas highway is raising questions about the fleet of drivers Amazon uses to move packages between its facilities. College freshman Iliana Velez's life was cut short in a crash with a contractor who was driving to pick up an Amazon load.",
      "A University of Texas freshman, Velez was working nights sorting packages part time at an Amazon fulfillment center.",
      "In the early morning hours of Jan. 3, 2022, Velez was on a break when she was forced off the road by a box truck driven by Jordan Sannicola, a contractor on his way to pick up an Amazon shipment. Velez's car rolled multiple times. She died at the scene.",
      "Her mother, Trula Velez, received the news from police that same evening.",
      "\"The officer knocked on my door and he said that she was involved in an accident, and she didn't make it,\" she said. \"I was such in a state of shock.\"",
      "When Sannicola was arrested four weeks later, investigators learned he had a history of traffic violations, a suspended driver's license and outstanding felony warrants, including one count of evading arrest with a vehicle. He told police he was using a hand-held mobile device when he collided with Iliana Velez's car.",
      "\"Someone with multiple warrants should not have been hired,\" Trula Velez said.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Trula Velez alleges Amazon had previously rejected Sannicola's application to deliver packages for the company's \"flex\" home delivery service after he failed a background check. Still, he was able to drive for an Amazon-contracted company. Despite his criminal history and driving record, Take Flight with B, a North Carolina motor carrier company, hired Sannicola to move Amazon freight.",
      "Missed warning signs?",
      "The Velez family attorney, Alex Hilliard, claims that because of the background check, Amazon was \"fully aware\" of Sannicola's poor driving record and criminal background when he started driving for Take Flight, which transported goods between Amazon facilities on a segment of the delivery network known as the \"middle mile.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges tracking technology provided by the Relay phone application Amazon uses to monitor driver location and performance had informed the company of Sannicola's unsafe driving behavior, but it failed to act.",
      "\"Mr. Sannicola had 70 different speeding violations [while working for Take Flight] that Amazon had been notified of,\" said Hilliard. \"They did nothing about that.\"",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data revealed Amazon contractors primarily in the company's \"middle-mile\" delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon. The analysis examined six years of monthly Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) unsafe driving rates and found the average rates of carriers who shipped for Amazon were at least 89% higher in every month.",
      "\"I was stunned,\" said Jason Miller, a professor at Michigan State University who is an expert in supply chain management. \"I've published many articles using these data. You do not see effects like this normally, where you have a set of carriers that is almost twice as unsafe as a different set of carriers.\"",
      "CBS News used roadside inspection reports in federal data to identify Amazon contractors. The reports, which are produced by law enforcement, indicate who a carrier said they were shipping for at the time of inspection. The analysis included carriers who shipped at least once for Amazon in the two years leading up to each month examined.",
      "Miller said the large patchwork of contractors Amazon uses for \"middle-mile\" transport poses challenges to ensuring a uniform culture of safety.",
      "\"The more you are essentially having your freight hauled by hundreds, if not thousands of small young firms, that makes it much more difficult to ensure those firms are operating safely versus a more - what we call strategic procurement model, where you may have a few very large carriers that you work with that handle a lot of freight,\" said Miller.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to FMCSA data, though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents. The FMCSA produces a crash involvement score for carriers, but it is not public.",
      "Amazon's response",
      "\"Any fatality is heartbreaking,\" said Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety. \"Any families that have been affected by this all have our condolences and our hearts go out to them.\"",
      "While Amazon mandates background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, Goodman said the company looks to the FMCSA to oversee \"middle-mile\" contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",
      "A spokeswoman for FMCSA confirmed it requires contractors who dispatch commercial motor vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than 10,000 pounds to conduct background checks into drivers' safety performance history as a condition of employment.",
      "Amazon said when the company learns a contracted carrier has violated FMCSA guidelines, the carrier can face consequences, including permanent suspension.",
      "\"We have taken disciplinary action against around 19,000 motor carriers for failing to meet FMCSA safety requirements,\" Goodman said.",
      "Among those carriers is Take Flight with B, the contractor that hired Jordan Sannicola. Amazon confirmed it suspended Take Flight with B permanently from its contracted fleet.\u00a0 The motor carrier has since gone out of business.",
      "Goodman defended Amazon's continuing reliance on third-party trucking contractors to move its freight and deliver packages.",
      "\"In the United States, transportation with motor carriers is driven by independent businesses, small businesses,\" said Goodman. \"It has been that way since at least the Carter administration.\"",
      "\"We are unique at Amazon in terms of our scale,\" Goodman said. \"But it's a business model that has worked, and worked well, and we're committed to having it be a catalyst to be able to improve safety for the roads for all of us.\"",
      "Amazon disputes CBS News' data findings. In a statement sent after the interview, a spokesperson said: \"We've worked closely with CBS throughout this story, and are disappointed that they continue to use data based on a flawed methodology. We take safety incredibly seriously and the truth is that overall crash rates across third party carriers that we work with have improved. Our standards are stricter than FMCSA requirements, and we'll continue working to ensure our partners are the safest carriers on the road.\"",
      "Among other complaints, the company took issue with how CBS News identified Amazon contractors\u2014it said inspection reports sometimes list the wrong shipper\u2014and how CBS News measured a carrier's safety.",
      "Amazon measures safety using the FMCSA's \"unsafe driving score,\" which is a number that applies different standards depending on the size of the carrier. This score is not made public by the government, but the underlying data is. Rather than ranking the carriers by size, CBS News looked directly at the underlying rates of unsafe driving violations like texting and speeding.",
      "CBS News consulted with multiple leading supply chain researchers, who all use FMCSA measures in peer-reviewed studies. Alex Scott, a University of Tennessee professor and expert in supply chain management, said he does not use the FMCSA's scores in part because they make smaller carriers appear safer than they are.",
      "\"I don't think that makes any sense,\" Scott said. \"If they're less safe, then they're less safe.\"",
      "What the court system says",
      "On Oct. 11, a judge sentenced Jordan Sannicola to a 40-year prison term for the charge of \"failing to stop and render aid -- accident involving death\" in the crash that killed Iliana Velez.",
      "\"One mistake cost someone's life, and that was my daughter's, and her life was just getting started,\" Trula Valez said.",
      "A court date for her lawsuit against Amazon is set for early 2025.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 18:06:40 -0500",
    "summary": "Elon Musk was seeking to reinstate a massive 2018 Tesla pay package after shareholders had reapproved it, but a judge denied his request.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's efforts to get his massive $56 billion 2018 Tesla pay package reinstated was rejected by a Delaware judge on Monday.",
      "The decision, issued by Delaware Chancery Court Judge Kathaleen St. J. McCormick, comes after a majority of Tesla shareholders in August reauthorized the compensation package during the electric vehicle maker's annual meeting.",
      "After it was initially approved in 2018, the pay package sparked a lawsuit from some Tesla shareholders who accused Musk and Tesla's board of directors of breaching their duties and unjustly enriching the billionaire. In January 2024, McCormick had ruled that Musk and his company failed to prove that the huge payout was legally warranted, prompting Musk to take the issue back to his shareholders in August.",
      "In her Dec. 2 decision, McCormick said that Musk had asked the court \"to flip its decision and enter judgment in their favor.\"",
      "She added, \"The motion to revise is denied,\" citing what the judge described as \"at least four fatal flaws\" in arguments from Musk's attorneys.",
      "\"The large and talented group of defense firms got creative with the ratification argument, but their unprecedented theories go against multiple strains of settled law,\" McCormick noted.",
      "Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Shares of Tesla fell slightly in after-hours trading, dipping $4.74, or 1.3%, to $352.35. The stock has gained 47% in the last month, buoyed by investor optimism that President-elect Donald Trump's victory at the polls will help boost Tesla's prospects, given Musk's support for his campaign.",
      "The stock options Tesla granted to Musk were initially worth $2.6 billion but had soared to $56 billion when McCormick blocked the package in January, according to\u00a0Bloomberg News.",
      "\"No basis in the common law\"",
      "Musk's attorneys had argued that the second vote made clear that Tesla shareholders, with full knowledge of the flaws in the 2018 process that McCormick had earlier pointed out, were adamant that Musk is entitled to the pay package. They asked the judge to vacate her order directing Tesla to rescind the pay package.",
      "Among the issues in their latest arguments, McCormick wrote, was a lack of procedural grounds for \"flipping the outcome of an adverse post-trial decision based on evidence they created after trial.\"",
      "She also objected to Musk's attempt to recertify the pay package through another shareholder vote, which she wrote his attorneys had argued served as \"common law ratification.\"",
      "\"What the defendants call 'common law ratification' has no basis in the common law \u2014 a stockholder vote standing alone cannot ratify a conflicted-controller transaction,\" she noted. \"[E]ven if a stockholder vote could have a ratifying effect, it could not do so here due to multiple, material misstatements in the proxy statement.\"",
      "McCormick also rejected an equally unprecedented and massive fee request by plaintiff attorneys, who argue they were entitled to legal fees in the form of Tesla stock valued at more than $5 billion. The judge said the attorneys were entitled to a fee award of $345 million.",
      "Despite the setback, Musk remains the world's wealthiest person, with a net worth of $343 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:41:51 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump said the U.S. would hit Brazil, Russia and six other countries with a crushing tariff if they sought to challenge the dollar.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump on Nov. 30 threatened to slap a 100% tariff on a group of nine nations \u2014 the so-called BRICS \u2014 if they try to replace the U.S. dollar with another currency.",
      "The BRICS countries include Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Trump said he'll enact the tariffs if the countries either move to create a new rival currency to the dollar or back an alternative currency to replace the greenback as the world's reserve medium of exchange.",
      "\"We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy,\" Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "Trump's move comes after he recently\u00a0threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all products from Canada and Mexico entering the U.S., along with an additional 10% tax on goods from China, in what he says would force the countries to do more to halt the flow of unauthorized migrants and illicit drugs into the U.S.",
      "Why do BRICS countries want an alternative currency?",
      "The BRICS \u2014 named after the original five members (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) \u2014 was formed in 2009 to advance the interests of emerging economies and to make them less dependent on the U.S. dollar, which is by far the most commonly used currency in global commerce.",
      "The primacy of the dollar in international trade gives the U.S. a number of advantages, including lower borrowing costs for the federal government and enormous geopolitical influence around the world.",
      "In October, Russian President Vladimir Putin called for a new\u00a0 international payments system at a BRICS summit, saying \"the dollar is being used as a weapon,\" the Associated Press reported. In 2023, meanwhile, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva proposed creating a new, common currency in South America to reduce its reliance on the dollar in international trade.",
      "Would a BRICS currency threaten the dollar?",
      "Creating a competing new currency would be difficult given how widely used the dollar is to conduct business around the world. Despite the existence of the euro and growing importance of China's renminbi, the dollar remains the world's main reserve currency, representing roughly 58% of the world's foreign exchange reserves, according to the\u00a0IMF. Also, critical commodities like oil and gold are still mostly bought and sold using dollars.",
      "\"Economically, it's not a major issue because the idea of the BRICS countries being able to put together an alternative as a reserve currency for the U.S. dollar is not plausible in the short or intermediate term,\" said Mark Weinstock, a global trade expert and professor of economics at Pace University.",
      "In other words, BRICS nations would struggle to create a viable currency given the relative strength and stability of the U.S. economy and the faith that global investors and trading partners have in U.S. government debt. And while the group's members have some interests in common, unifying behind a single currency would be politically fraught and technically complex.",
      "\"Fundamentally, if you are going to create your own form of money, that desirability is commensurate with the economic strength and integrity of the issuer. BRICS countries don't have the type of institutions that inspire global confidence to convince people that it is a satisfactory alternative to the dollar,\" Weinstock said.",
      "Some BRICS members are already downplaying the push to get a new currency off the ground. After Trump's tariff threat last weekend, South Africa's government on Monday issued a statement on social media saying there are no plans to create a BRICS currency.",
      "\"Recent misreporting has led to the incorrect narrative that BRICS is planning to create a new currency,\" South Africa's Department of International Relations and Cooperation said. \"This is not the case. The discussions within BRICS focus on trading among member countries using their own national currencies.\"",
      "What would stiff tariffs on BRICS goods mean for U.S. consumers?",
      "While economists largely agree that a 100% tariff on goods imported to the U.S. from BRICS nations is a long shot, if it came to pass the move would not benefit U.S. consumers, they say. Such levies would drive up the cost of goods from BRICS member nations, potentially fueling inflation and leading to higher prices for consumers.",
      "\"Like any tariffs, this would mean higher prices for consumers,\" Weinstock said. \"That's always the impact of the tariff.\"",
      "Among the leading products the U.S. gets from BRICS countries are coffee from Brazil, electronics and clothes from China, and minerals from South Africa, according to trade data.",
      "Why are some economists criticizing Trump for threatening the BRICS?",
      "Some experts criticized Trump's threat to punish the BRICS, saying it makes the U.S. look weak.",
      "\"It isn't a good look, as it indirectly elevates the stature of a non-threat and suggests a lack of confidence in the dollar,\" Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and former Treasury Department economist,\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "Trump's threat could actually accelerate a move away from the dollar by other countries, according to Setser, who said that an effort to effectively coerce countries to use the dollar \"is actually a long-run threat to the dollar's global role.\"",
      "\"It makes the use of the dollar appear to be a favor to the U.S.,\" he added.",

Reporters placed plastic cold drink cups, embedded with trackers, into 57 labeled recycling bins at Starbucks locations across the country to see where the cups went. Only 36 provided reliable data.",

Only four cups were traced to Material Recovery Facilities, where recyclables are sorted and prepared for reuse.",
      "While attaching a metal Bluetooth tracker to plastic and placing it in a recycling bin could contaminate the item and prevent it from being recycled, only four of the cups tagged by CBS News went to facilities that sort and remove this type of contamination, whereas the rest were immediately diverted for the landfill or incineration.",
      "Two of the trackers revealed a surprising journey: one dropped at a Starbucks in New Jersey and another in Boston both traveled thousands of miles before ultimately ending up in the same landfill in Alabama.",
      "\"When it comes to recycling, companies across the country and the world are lying about all these single-use plastics, saying they're recyclable,\" said Jan Dell, a former chemical engineer and founder of The Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit dedicated to combating plastic pollution. \"They're not telling the truth.\"",
      "The challenge of plastic waste",
      "Americans produce more plastic waste each year than any other country \u2013 almost 500 pounds per person. Most of that plastic ends up as trash, according to a 2022 Greenpeace USA report, which revealed that the U.S. recycling rate for plastics is less than 6%.",
      "Companies such as Starbucks, which sells beverages to more than 6 billion customers a year globally, are a major generator of plastic waste. More than 75% of Starbucks' U.S. beverage sales are cold drinks, often served in plastic cups, but the company aims to reduce its overall waste by 50% by 2030.",
      "\"Our goal for cups is that 100% of our customer-facing cups will be reusable, recyclable or compostable,\" says Amelia Landers, vice president of innovation and solutions at Starbucks. Landers was part of the team that redesigned its cold plastic cups in April to be made with up to 20% less plastic, which she says will help divert more than 13 million pounds of plastic from landfills each year.",
      "\"There's a guilt factor associated with using the single-use plastic, for maybe 20 minutes, and then having it exist in the landfill forever, or get incinerated and cause carbon emissions,\" said Dell, which is one of the reasons she believes Starbucks encourages recycling in-store.",
      "But making sure that Starbucks cup is recycled is harder than you might think. Unlike other recyclable materials such as glass, paper or aluminum, plastics are not uniform. Thousands of different types exist, each with unique characteristics, chemicals and additives, making sorting and recycling nearly impossible. For instance, certain beverage bottles cannot be recycled with food containers because they are made from different types of plastic, are different shapes and may be different colors.",
      "Can Starbucks cups be recycled?",
      "Consumers assume items like Starbucks cups can be recycled because of the arrows on the cup or blue bins in the store, but only 9% of Material Recovery Facilities sort the specific plastic that makes a Starbucks cup to be sold as recycled content and very few places actually buy that plastic to recycle it into new content.",
      "Starbucks cups are made out of polypropylene, or No. 5 plastic, and Landers told CBS News that these cups are designed to be recyclable and there are facilities that do this in the U.S. CBS News asked Starbucks to send a list of companies that recycle No. 5 plastic beverage cups. They sent a list of four facilities: three that collected and sorted No. 5 plastics, but only one company, KW Plastics in Alabama, recycles No. 5 cups into new plastic items.",
      "KW Plastics is one of a handful of facilities in America that recycles No. 5 plastics into new material, but of the 160,000 tons of plastic waste made up of No. 5 cups and plates generated in the U.S. each year, less than 1% is recycled, according to the latest EPA report on plastic recycling.",
      "A reusable solution",
      "Starbucks officials say they can only control what happens inside the company's stores, and work with outside partners to ensure its waste ends up in the right place.",
      "\"We're working to increase the recycle capture of the plastic cups so that the recyclability has higher potential,\" says Landers. Her team is currently testing new cup materials and models to encourage reusable cups both in the store, and for customers to take away.",
      "\"The more we can offer customers to sit and stay, that takes a tremendous amount of single-use cups out of the landfill entirely,\" she says.",
      "Starbucks was the first major retailer to roll out a nationwide program where customers can provide their own cup for mobile and drive-thru orders earlier this year.",
      "\"We have tested over 30 different borrow-a-cup models around the world, and there is a lot to learn and a lot to solve,\" says Landers.",
      "Governments can also provide incentives for businesses to innovate by eliminating unnecessary plastics and encouraging reusable products. \"Regulation is absolutely critical as well as enforcement,\" said Dell, with The Last Beach Cleanup.",
      "Prohibitions on single-use plastics are becoming more common. Last week the Miami-Dade County Commissions approved a resolution to eliminate single-use plastics at municipal buildings, which include the Miami Zoo and the airport.",
      "Dell says customers can be critical in pushing for change. \"They can demand that companies be honest,\" she said. \"Secondly, they can choose with their pocketbooks and bring back in a reusable cup.\"",

      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he intends to nominate cryptocurrency advocate Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "Trump said Atkins, the CEO of Patomak Partners and a former SEC commissioner, was a \"proven leader for common sense regulations.\" In the years since leaving the SEC, Atkins has made the case against too much market regulation.",
      "\"He believes in the promise of robust, innovative capital markets that are responsive to the needs of Investors, & that provide capital to make our Economy the best in the World. He also recognizes that digital assets & other innovations are crucial to Making America Greater than Ever Before,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.",

      "Trump, once a crypto skeptic, had pledged to make the U.S. \"the crypto capital of the planet\" and create a \"strategic reserve\" of bitcoin. Money has poured into crypto assets since he won. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, is now above $95,000. And shares in crypto platform Coinbase have surged more than 70% since the election.",
      "Paul Grewal, chief legal officer of Coinbase, congratulated Atkins in a post on X.",
      "\"We appreciate his commitment to balance in regulating U.S. securities markets and look forward to his fresh leadership at (the SEC),\" Grewal wrote. \"It's sorely needed and cannot come a day too soon.\"",

      "\"He'd probably take the position that no cryptocurrency is a security, and hence no exchange that deals with crypto is a securities exchange,\" Sherman said. \"The opportunity to defraud investors would be there in a very significant way.\"",
      "Atkins began his career as a lawyer and has a long history working in the financial markets sector, both in government and private practice. In the 1990s, he worked on the staffs of two former SEC chairmen, Richard C. Breeden and Arthur Levitt.",

      "He also emphasized investor education and increased enforcement efforts against those who steal from investors over the internet, manipulate markets, engage in Ponzi schemes and other types of fraud.",
      "At the same time, Atkins objected to stiff penalties imposed on companies accused of fraudulent conduct, contending that they did not deter crime. He caused a stir in the summer of 2006 when he said the practice of granting stock options to executives before the disclosure of news that was certain to increase the share price did not constitute insider trading.",

      "Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's embattled pick for secretary of defense, received a six-figure severance payment and signed a non-disclosure agreement when he exited the organization Concerned Veterans of America. The payment came amid allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety, as well as dissension among its leaders over Hegseth's foreign policy views.",
      "The Army veteran turned Fox News host signed a non-disclosure agreement when he stepped down as CEO in January 2016, two sources associated with Concerned Veterans of America told CBS News, with one source saying the agreement included a financial payout. The CVA sources spoke to CBS News under conditions of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss legally-binding contracts, while also fearing professional reprisal.",
      "Public tax filings reviewed by CBS News confirm that Hegseth was paid more than $172,000 between October 2016 and September 2017 \u2013 well after Hegseth's formal departure from his role as CEO of Concerned Veterans of America in January 2016.",
      "Hegseth remained listed on tax filings as a former CEO working 50 hours a week between 2016 and 2017. An archived 2016 biography on Hegseth's website described him as a Fox News contributor and host, and did not list an ongoing role with Concerned Veterans for America.",

He also said he spoke with Trump Wednesday morning, and the president-elect encouraged him to keep fighting.",
      "Experts consulted by CBS News said severance payments and non-disclosure agreements for outgoing CEOs are common. Such payments are issued for a number of reasons, including to maintain professional relationships, to work as an adviser to an incoming CEO, or to provide a soft landing for departing leaders, they said.",
      "Hegseth has contested the allegation that he was forced out of his CEO position. On Dec. 4 he retweeted a letter obtained by the New York Post on X, saying: \"Read for yourself. You'll see the truth is on our side.\"",

Senior leaders of the organization strongly opposed Hegseth's foreign policy advocacy over its historical mission of backing conservative fixes to the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "However, the sources also highlighted what Lair's letter did not mention, specifically internal assessments of Hegseth's handling of the organization's finances and the alleged incidents of intoxication and sexual misconduct, which Hegseth and Parlatore, his attorney, have denied.",

      "The filings show expenses at the organization were slashed after Hegseth's departure. From October 2016 to September 2017, compensation, salaries and wages were reduced to $2 million, down from almost $7 million the previous year. Spending on travel was reduced to $416,000, down from almost $2.4 million, and spending on conferences, conventions and meetings amounted to $124,000, down from $2.4 million.",
      "Hegseth has denied allegations of financial mismanagement, repeated incidents of intoxication and sexual impropriety at the organization. In an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal published Dec. 4, Hegseth said, \"We had hundreds of employees and thousands of volunteers \u2014 yet based on the anonymous accusations of a few disgruntled employees, the legacy media has made it sound as if we ran a college frat house. That's just untrue.\"",

I spoke to the president this morning. He said, I'm his guy.\"",
      "Despite the acrimony between DeSantis and Trump during the primary campaign, the Florida governor is interested in the job, according to two sources familiar with DeSantis' thinking. His second and final term as governor ends in January 2027. Trump has already announced a series of Cabinet nominees who hail from Florida, including Sen. Marco Rubio, for secretary of state. Although serving as defense secretary would pose some political risk, DeSantis believes it would position him well for a presidential run in 2028, the source said.",
      "Hegseth, a former \"Fox & Friends\" weekend co-host and Army veteran, has been meeting with Senate Republicans in recent weeks to build support for his confirmation. But reports in recent days that detailed alleged sexual misconduct, financial mismanagement at veterans' charities, repeated intoxication and infidelity appeared to be softening his support. Some Senate Republicans have called the allegations \"disturbing\" and said they came as a surprise.",

In fact, most have said, 'Let's take a picture, and I'm behind you all the way.'\"",
      "Hegseth also defended himself in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal Wednesday. Amid reports about his removal as the head of a veterans' charity over allegations of financial mismanagement, intoxication, sexual misconduct and fostering a toxic work climate, Hegseth wrote of his work for that organization, Concerned Veterans for America.",
      "\"We fought entrenched interests and mobilized veterans and patriotic Americans across the country,\" he said, denying reports of any misconduct and accusing the media of publishing falsehoods.",

      "In his interview with Kelly, Hegseth addressed the sexual assault allegation that emerged in late November. He responded \"absolutely not\" when asked if he had raped a woman in a Monterey, California, hotel in 2017. He admitted that it would have once been a fair characterization to call him a \"serial cheater\" but says he has changed. \"I may have been drinking, but I was cognizant enough to remember every single detail. And I'm not here to say that my conduct was good,\" he said. \"Being in a hotel room with someone that's not the person you're with is not OK. I own up to that, and I've had to own up to that, and that's been difficult.\"",
      "He said he paid his accuser \"because I had to \u2014 or at least I thought I did at the time.\" He explained that he was newly married, was under consideration for a role in the first Trump administration and wanted to protect his family and his Fox News job.",
      "He also responded to reporting by NBC News that cited current and former Fox News employees who said that \"on more than a dozen occasions\" while Hegseth was a \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" co-host, \"they smelled alcohol on him before he went to air,\" and appeared on TV \"after they'd heard him talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set.\" The report said \"[t]hree current employees said his drinking remained a concern up until Trump announced him as his choice to run the Pentagon, at which point Hegseth left Fox.\"",
      "But in the op-ed, Hegseth did not directly address allegations about his alcohol consumption. \"I've been at Fox News\u2014where I saw my work as a continuation of my mission to fight for America. Again, the legacy press has used anonymous sources to try to discredit even that,\" and he referred readers to his X feed for statements of support from professional colleagues. He did tell Kelly, \"I've never had a drinking problem.\"",
      "North Dakota GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer is scheduled to meet with Hegseth Wednesday afternoon and told reporters earlier in the day, \"The allegations are very, very serious. They can't be trivialized. And I just want to know that, that he's redeemed, and going forward, he's going to be better.\"",
      "Cramer also added, \"I think the mood of the conference is one of the pretty serious, really, really serious about it, and serious about how these things affect his ability to do the job, the ability of the troops to look up to him.\"",
      "He suggested the Republican conference was watching for signals from the Trump transition team about Hegseth.",
      "\"There's the mood of the conference, and then there's the mood of the Trump transition team itself,\" he said. \"So we'll see what kind of messages and signals we hear throughout the course of the day. As you can tell, these things have been breaking pretty fast and furious.\"",
      "Cramer said of Ernst that she would be \"easy to confirm, and I think she'd be great,\" and in fact, \"if she wanted it, she'd be my first pick.\"",
      "\"I have never backed down from a fight and won't back down from this one,\" Hegseth wrote, adding, \"I look forward to an honest confirmation hearing with our distinguished senators\u2014not a show trial in the press.\"",
      "Hegseth has continued to meet with the Republican senators who will weigh in on his nomination. But one prominent Republican, Sen. Josh Hawley, told reporters Wednesday afternoon that Hegseth canceled their upcoming meeting.",
      "\"I was supposed to sit down with him tomorrow, but they canceled that meeting,\" Hawley said.",
      "\"I don't know where things stand at the moment,\" he said of Hegseth's expected nomination and added, \"It's not 100% clear to me who [Trump] wants as secretary of defense right now.\"",
      "Hegseth told Kelly he planned to keep meeting with senators to earn their support, but he acknowledged that there's a possibility he may not be confirmed. \"That's the president's call,\" he said when asked whether he would withdraw from the process.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court weighed whether Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria violates the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared sympathetic to Tennessee's efforts to restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, as the justices stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth.",
      "Twenty-four states have passed laws similar to Tennessee's, which prohibits puberty blockers or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18. The dispute brought by the Biden administration, three families and a doctor tests whether states cross a constitutional line when regulating medical care that transgender adolescents argue is crucial to their well-being.",
      "The court's conservative justices appeared likely to side with Tennessee in the case. Several cited \"evolving\" medical research as to the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria. At numerous points during arguments, which ran more than two hours, several members of the conservative wing questioned whether determinations about policies with shifting scientific findings are for courts to decide, rather than best left to state lawmakers elected by the people.",
      "\"If the Constitution doesn't take sides, if there's strong, forceful, scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn't it best to leave it to the democratic process?\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts noted recent studies by some health authorities in European countries that have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth. Following an independent review from the United Kingdom, England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"We're not the best situated to address issues like that,\" Roberts said. \"Doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored a 2020 decision that extended protections from discrimination in the workplace to transgender and gay employees, did not ask any questions.",
      "U.S. v. Skrmetti",
      "The case before the Supreme Court, U.S. v. Skrmetti, involves a Tennessee law known as SB1 that was\u00a0adopted in 2023. It bars health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in prohibiting treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Tennessee's law is part of a wave of measures passed by GOP-led states in recent years prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. President-elect Donald Trump has also pledged to restrict medical treatments for transgender adolescents and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, another area where states have enacted bans.",
      "During oral arguments, several of the court's conservative justices sounded skeptical of the federal government's assertion that Tennessee's ban should be struck down as unconstitutional because it discriminates based on sex. They also raised concerns about the evidence surrounding the efficacy of the treatments and questioned whether courts should second-guess state lawmakers on the issue.",
      "\"If it's evolving like that and changing, and England's pulling back and Sweden's pulling back, it strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come, the nine of us, and constitutionalize the whole area when the rest of the world, or at least the countries that have been at the forefront of this, are pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Roberts echoed that sentiment, saying the justices \"might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else, but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito sparred with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the Biden administration, over medical research on puberty blockers and hormone therapy, peppering her with questions about the findings of studies into the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Kavanaugh, later joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, questioned the implications of a decision that would adopt the Biden administration's preferred standard of review that judges should apply when weighing the constitutionality of Tennessee's law and others like it.",
      "\"What would that mean for women's and girl's sports in particular?\" he asked Prelogar. \"Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women and girl's sports \u2014 basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, etc. \u2014 notwithstanding the competitive, fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?\"",
      "The Biden administration has argued that the lower court applied the wrong standard when evaluating the constitutionality of Tennessee's law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit held that the ban is subject to rational-basis review, the most deferential of the three tiers of scrutiny. But Prelogar has argued the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with the Biden administration, it could send the case back to the lower court to apply that more demanding standard, as Prelogar is asking it to do.",
      "The court's liberals highlighted the potentially dire consequences of gender dysphoria and the role of gender-affirming care in addressing them, and likened Tennessee's ban to state laws that discriminated on the basis of race in the past. They grilled the attorney appearing on behalf of the state, Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice, with questions aimed at showing the state's law constitutes sex-based discrimination.",
      "\"The whole thing is imbued with sex. It's based on sex,\" Justice Elena Kagan told Rice. \"You might have reasons for thinking that it's an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them. But it's a dodge to say, this is not based on sex, it's based on medical purpose.\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the \"evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment.\"",
      "Rice argued that the state is trying to protect young people from \"irreversible and life-altering consequences\" of these medical interventions and said the treatments are \"risky\" and \"unproven.\" The law, he told the Supreme Court, sets age- and use-based limits on medical care, and is a routine exercise of the state's authority to regulate medicine.",
      "\"Politically accountable lawmakers, not judges, are in the best position to assess this evolving medical issue,\" he said.",
      "But the Biden administration, along with the three Tennessee families and Memphis doctor, assert the state's ban draws sex-based lines and discriminates based on transgender status, a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Under Tennessee's law, an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can, Prelogar said. And an adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can, she told the court.",
      "Prelogar argued Tennessee's law \"categorically bans treatment when and only when it's inconsistent with the patient's birth sex.\"",
      "Shortly before Tennessee's law took effect, the families with transgender children and Dr. Susan Lacy, who provided gender-affirming care to patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria, challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status and is likely unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the \"benefits of the medical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established,\" and said the law bars treatments for \"a tiny fraction of minors, while leaving them available to all other minors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\"",
      "A divided panel of judges on the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued. The measure, the court found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "Both the Biden administration and the families, represented by the ACLU, separately asked the Supreme Court to review the 6th Circuit's decision. The high court in June agreed to do so, but took up only the Biden administration's appeal, which asked the justices to decide whether Tennessee's law violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents had argued the law infringed on their due process right to make decisions about their children's medical care, but the justices are not considering that question.",
      "Barrett noted that regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the parents could still pursue their parental-rights claim.",
      "Prelogar argued on behalf of the U.S. on Wednesday, and she shared time with Chase Strangio of the ACLU, who made history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court. Rice presented the state's case to the justices.",
      "The case is the most significant involving transgender rights that the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, has heard in years. In 2020, the high court divided 6-3 in finding that Title VII's protections from discrimination in the workplace extend to gay and transgender employees. Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal members joined.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in this case is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he has named longtime aide Peter Navarro, who served on the White House Trade Council in the first Trump administration, to be \"senior counselor for trade and manufacturing.\"",
      "The announcement comes just months after Navarro, 75, was released from prison after serving a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena. Navarro was subpoenaed for records and testimony in 2022 by the now-defunct House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, and he refused to comply, claiming that Trump had asserted executive privilege over the material sought by the committee.",
      "A federal judge in Washington convicted Navarro of two counts of contempt, and he reported to a Florida federal correctional facility in March to serve a four-month sentence. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in July the same day he was released from prison, slamming the \"Department of Injustice\" in his speech.",
      "Trump praised Navarro in the announcement Wednesday as a \"man who was treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else.\"",
      "As a trade adviser in the first Trump administration, Navarro endorsed \"America First\" trade policies, including steep tariffs to protect domestic industries.",
      "In the social media post announcing Navarro's selection, Trump praised Navarro's time as a trade adviser. \"The Senior Counselor position leverages Peter's broad range of White House experience, while harnessing his extensive Policy analytic and Media skills,\" Trump wrote. \"His mission will be to help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas.\"",
      "Trump announced in 2016 that Navarro would be serving at the helm of the newly formed White House Trade Council and as director of trade and industrial policy. Prior to that, he had written a book called \"Death by China\" that endorsed a hardline toward trade with China.",
      "In March 2020, Trump named Navarro as policy coordinator of the Defense Production Act, which Trump invoked on March 18, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, to manufacture medical supplies and PPE. On \"60 Minutes\" in April 2020, Navarro fiercely defended protectionist trade policies despite the shortage of that equipment before the pandemic.",
      "\"It's the globalization of production through multinational corporations, who salute no flag, who love cheap sweatshop labor, and who love the massive subsidies that the Chinese government throws at production to bring it from here to there,\" Navarro told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker.",
      "Congressional subpoena and prison time",
      "The House Jan. 6 committee subpoenaed records and testimony from Navarro, alleging that he developed plans to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election. \"Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the January 6th attack on the Capitol,\" said the committee's chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, at the time.",
      "In 2021, Navarro wrote a book in which he wrote that he and other Trump advisers constructed a plan called the \"Green Bay Sweep\" as the \"last, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats' jaws of deceit.\" Additionally, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 attack, Navarro promoted a document he called the \"Navarro Report\" that asserted baseless and discredited claims of election fraud.",
      "Navarro refused to comply with the subpoena, saying that Trump had invoked executive privilege. The committee recommended in a unanimous vote to recommend contempt charges, with the Justice Department ultimately agreeing, charging him with two counts of contempt.",
      "Navarro testified at an evidentiary hearing that Trump invoked executive privilege in a Feb. 2022 conversation, 11 days after he was subpoenaed. But U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta barred that defense, saying there was no evidence that any official assertion was made, and Navarro did not testify at his one-day trial.",
      "In his sentencing, Mehta noted Navarro's public statements after the attack and said there was no evidence of executive privilege. While Mehta said that it appeared that Navarro at least believed he was operating under the guise of executive privilege, he said executive privilege is not a \"magical dust\" or \"a get-out-of-jail free card.\"",
      "Navarro attempted to appeal his conviction, even requesting after he surrendered to prison his case be heard by the Supreme Court, which declined. He reported to prison in March and served four months at the Federal Correctional Institute in Miami, which is reserved for older inmates.",

      "\"I have learned that politics alone cannot measure up to the challenges we face,\" Romney said. \"A country's character is a reflection not just of its elected officials, but also of its people. I leave Washington to return to be one among them.\"",
      "Romney announced in September 2023 that he would not seek reelection after his first term in the upper chamber, noting at the time that \"it's time for a new generation of leaders.\" The 77-year-old Utah Republican was the GOP nominee for president in 2012 and also served as the governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.",
      "In his farewell speech Wednesday, Romney said that \"Americans have always been fundamentally good.\" He argued that while there have been mistakes, \"some grievous,\" the nation has from its earliest days rushed to help neighbors in need, welcomed the poor and the huddled masses and respected different faiths.",
      "Romney said as his time in office comes to an end, he hopes to be \"a voice of unity and virtue,\" saying that \"it is only if the American people merit his benevolence, that God will continue to bless America.\"",
      "The Utah Republican, known as a moderate in the upper chamber who has been openly critical of President-elect Donald Trump, became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a member of his own party in 2020 during Trump's first impeachment trial. And he also voted to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. At the time he announced his retirement, Romney told reporters that the possibility of Trump returning to the White House did not weigh into his decision.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell praised Romney's \"long and honorable career on the national political stage\" on the Senate floor Wednesday.",
      "\"Mitt Romney's repeated success in public office is a testament to his transcendent appeal of his character,\" McConnell said, citing his work as Massachusetts governor and Utah senator. \"As it turns out, uncompromising honesty, earnest humility and evident devotion to faith and family are as compelling in Cedar City as they are in Concord.\"",
      "\"Of course, a certain telegenic quality, dare I say, a presidential aura, doesn't hurt either,\" McConnell continued.",
      "McConnell said Romney made himself a \"linchpin\" for bipartisan negotiations, and \"managed to cram more into six years than many colleagues fit in in 12 or 18.\"",
      "Romney, too, celebrated his work on the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Electoral Count Reform Act, gun safety legislation and religious protections in marriage legislation, saying that he \"will leave this chamber with a sense of achievement.\" But he acknowledged that he will \"also leave with a recognition that I did not achieve everything I had hoped.\"",
      "Romney said \"the scourge of partisan politics\" has prevented efforts to stabilize the nation's debt, stressing that without the \"burden\" of the interest on the debt, the nation could spend three times as much military procurement, or twice as much on Social Security benefits every month.",
      "McConnell noted that observers might have wondered after Romney's governorship and bid for the presidency what more he had to prove as he came to the Senate.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 12:41:32 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Wednesday will consider the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that prohibits gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court is set to convene Wednesday to hear arguments in a landmark case involving access to gender-affirming care like puberty blockers and hormone therapy for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "The case concerns the constitutionality of a Tennessee law that bans this medical care for transgender adolescents. Twenty-four states have measures on the books that are similar to Tennessee's, and advocates for transgender rights are warning that if the Supreme Court upholds the ban, it would open the door to state lawmakers outlawing gender-affirming care for adults.",
      "The dispute is the first in which the justices will consider the constitutionality of state efforts to regulate medical interventions for transgender youth, but it comes as Republican-led states have enacted a slew of restrictions targeting transgender individuals, including policies on\u00a0sports teams and restroom access.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to restrict medical treatments for transgender minors and bar transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. And while the Biden administration will argue Wednesday that the Supreme Court should invalidate Tennessee's law, the incoming Trump administration could reverse the government's position once it is in power early next year.",
      "That shift in stance, though, may not preclude the high court from issuing a decision in the case, expected by the end of June.",
      "\"It's very difficult for these teenagers, who already face a difficult scenario, when there's this institutional governmental rejection of who they are,\" said Dr. Susan Lacy, a Memphis-based physician who challenged Tennessee's law alongside three families. \"That's very difficult to be told either you don't know who you are \u2014 being told that you're wrong, you don't know what you're talking about, your parents are trying to manipulate you, all of that kind of rhetoric is really difficult for these kids.\"",
      "Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's Republican-led legislature approved its ban on certain medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria in March 2023. Puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been used to treat gender dysphoria for decades, but in the past three years, GOP-controlled state legislatures have adopted measures restricting access to these treatments for minors.",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits health care providers from administering any puberty blocker or hormone if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identity with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argues that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring procedures that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "The use of these treatments for conditions such as precocious puberty, congenital defects or other diseases is allowed in Tennessee.",
      "The Biden administration argues that Tennessee's ban draws lines based on sex and discriminates against transgender people, in violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection. The Justice Department has argued that the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, rather than the more relaxed standard applied by the lower court, rational basis review.",
      "\"Most immediately, SB1 prohibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their doctors from making critically important and intensely personal decisions about the appropriate medical treatment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical condition,\" Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue on behalf of the federal government, wrote in a filing with the high court.",
      "But Tennessee officials assert that the law is a routine exercise of state power to regulate medicine, and it is medical use and purpose \u2014 not sex \u2014 that dictate the availability of treatments. The state, they have said, is trying to protect children from the \"life-altering risks\" of gender-affirming care, which they said is \"risky\" and \"unproven.\"",
      "\"While the government is free to favor its transition-first, ask-questions-later approach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to that same choice,\" state officials wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court.",
      "The challenge before the high court was brought by three families and Lacy, who began providing gender-affirming care eight years ago. One of the challengers, a transgender girl identified in court filings as L.W., was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at the age of 12 and began taking puberty blockers, followed by hormones.",
      "Today, the state's ban means L.W., now 16, must travel to another state to receive her treatments.",
      "\"Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming medical care is an active threat to the future my daughter deserves,\" Brian Williams, L.W.'s father, told reporters in a press call hosted by the ACLU. \"It infringes not only on her freedom to be herself, but on our family's love for her.\"",
      "The ACLU is representing the families who challenged Tennessee's law. Chase Strangio, a lawyer with the group, will make history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court when he participates in oral arguments Wednesday.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Biden administration and the challengers, finding that Tennessee's ban likely violates the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The court ruled the law discriminates based on sex and targets transgender people, and said the benefits of the health care outlawed by the law are \"well-established.\"",
      "But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit reversed the lower court's decision and allowed Tennessee's law to take effect. The measure, the divided panel found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "The Biden administration and the families appealed the 6th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, which agreed in June to review the ruling.",
      "A \"sense of mental clarity\"",
      "The Williams Institute, a think tank that conducts research on sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates there are roughly 1.6 million people ages 13 and older who identify as transgender. There are more than 300,000 transgender youth between the ages of 13 and 17 who live in states where access to puberty blockers and hormones is restricted, according to the center.",
      "Daniel Trujillo, a 17-year-old transgender boy who lives in Tucson, Arizona, began social transitioning when he was 8 years old and was prescribed puberty blockers after years of discussions between his parents, pediatrician and, later, a clinical psychologist.",
      "\"I myself am proof that gender-affirming care works and it helps people and it saves lives,\" he told CBS News. \"When I was experiencing a lot of dysphoria, it was really hard for me to focus on things that mattered. I couldn't focus on school. I was very anxious and internalizing whatever I was experiencing, and once I was able to feel more comfortable in myself and feel affirmed with me, as who I am, my parents were able to see the shift, my friends and family could see the shift.\"",
      "In 2022, then-Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, signed into law a bill that prohibits \"irreversible gender reassignment surgery\" for minors. An earlier version of the proposal would have also outlawed puberty blockers and hormone therapy, but it failed in a state senate committee.",
      "Still, Lizette Trujillo, Daniel's mother, said that had the state banned those treatments, the family would have moved elsewhere to ensure her son could continue to receive medical care.",
      "\"That felt really scary, because here is my child who is emotionally well, who has maintained strong self-esteem, feels love, he's doing well. And then to have the state infringe on our right and totally change our trajectory or change his life felt awful, it felt scary and felt unjust,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Medical interventions in minors experiencing gender dysphoria began in Europe in the late 1990s, when Dutch health care providers started offering puberty blockers. In 1998, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended puberty blockers at the start of puberty and hormone treatment for transgender youth at 16.",
      "In recent years, though, some health authorities in European nations have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth.",
      "Sonia Suter, a law professor at George Washington University Law School, said the Supreme Court could side with Tennessee and conclude that it should give deference to the state legislature in regulating health care because of medical uncertainty and disagreement among experts.",
      "Citing an independent review from the United Kingdom, after which England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria, Suter that it could \"make it easy for the U.S. Supreme Court to say, you know what, there is clearly medical uncertainty here and therefore we're not going to second-guess.\"",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, Tennessee officials warn that treatments for gender dysphoria carry health risks, such as negative impacts to fertility, diminished bone density and a higher risk of cancer.",
      "But Lacy, the provider who has roughly 700 transgender patients out of roughly 3,000 who visit her practice, said she has not seen any major complications affecting long-term health.",
      "\"When I first started providing trans care, the most compelling piece of it was that, prior to any sort of physical changes or obvious transitional changes, the first thing that people would tell me is that they felt like there was sort of a sense of mental clarity that they experienced,\" she said.",
      "If not treated, gender dysphoria can lead to physical and psychological harms, the Biden administration has warned, including depression and self-harm. Up to one-third of transgender high school students attempt suicide in a given year, according to a study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "\"It's this goose chase trying to find safety, which is not the American dream that everyone talks about,\" Daniel Trujillo said of the patchwork of state laws restricting gender-affirming care. \"All American citizens should be able to live freely wherever they want to and live fully wherever they want to.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:27:28 -0500",
    "summary": "About 3.7 million people are at immediate risk of losing health coverage should the federal government cut funding for Medicaid expansions, as some allies of President-elect Donald Trump have proposed.",
    "story": [
      "With Donald Trump's return to the White House and Republicans taking full control of Congress in 2025, the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion is back on the chopping block.",
      "More than 3 million adults in nine states would be at immediate risk of losing their health coverage should the GOP reduce the extra federal Medicaid funding that's enabled states to widen eligibility, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News, and the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families. That's because the states have trigger laws that would swiftly end their Medicaid expansions if federal funding falls.",
      "The states are Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia.",
      "The 2010 Affordable Care Act encouraged states to expand Medicaid programs to cover more low-income Americans who didn't get health insurance through their jobs. Forty states and the District of Columbia agreed, extending health insurance since 2014 to an estimated 21 million people and helping drive the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows.",
      "In exchange, the federal government pays 90% of the cost to cover the expanded population. That's far higher than the federal match for other Medicaid beneficiaries, which averages about 57% nationwide.",
      "Conservative policy groups, which generally have opposed the ACA, say the program costs too much and covers too many people. Democrats say the Medicaid expansion has saved lives and helped communities by widening coverage to people who could not afford private insurance.",
      "If Congress cuts federal funding, Medicaid expansion would be at risk in all states that have opted into it \u2014 even those without trigger laws \u2014 because state legislatures would be forced to make up the difference, said Renuka Tipirneni, an associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.",
      "Decisions to keep or roll back the expansion \"would depend on the politics at the state level,\" Tipirneni said.",
      "For instance, Michigan approved a trigger as part of its Medicaid expansion in 2013, when it was controlled by a Republican governor and legislature. Last year, with the government controlled by Democrats, the state eliminated its funding trigger.",
      "Six of the nine states with trigger laws \u2014 Arizona, Arkansas, Indiana, Montana, North Carolina and Utah \u2014 went for Trump in the 2024 election.",
      "Most of the nine states' triggers kick in if federal funding falls below the 90% threshold. Arizona's trigger would eliminate its expansion if funding falls below 80%.",
      "Montana's law rolls back expansion below 90% funding but allows it to continue if lawmakers identify additional funding. Under state law, Montana lawmakers must reauthorize its Medicaid expansion in 2025 or the expansion will end.",
      "Across the states with triggers, between 3.1 million and 3.7 million people would swiftly lose their coverage, researchers at KFF and the Georgetown center estimate. The difference depends on how states treat people who were added to Medicaid before the ACA expansion; they may continue to qualify even if the expansion ends.",
      "Three other states \u2014 Iowa, Idaho and New Mexico\u2014 have laws that require their governments to mitigate the financial impact of losing federal Medicaid expansion funding but would not automatically end expansions. With those three states included, about 4.3 million Medicaid expansion enrollees would be at risk of losing coverage, according to KFF.",
      "The ACA allowed Medicaid expansions to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $20,783 for an individual in 2024.",
      "Nearly a quarter of the 81 million people enrolled in Medicaid nationally are in the program due to expansions.",
      "\"With a reduction in the expansion match rate, it is likely that all states would need to evaluate whether to continue expansion coverage because it would require a significant increase in state spending,\" said Robin Rudowitz, vice president and director of the Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured at KFF. \"If states drop coverage, it is likely that there would be an increase in the number of uninsured, and that would limit access to care across red and blue states that have adopted expansion.\"",
      "States rarely cut eligibility for social programs such as Medicaid once it's been granted.",
      "The triggers make it politically easier for state lawmakers to end Medicaid expansion because they would not have to take any new action to cut coverage, said Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.",
      "To see the impact of trigger laws, consider what happened after the Supreme Court in 2022 struck down Roe v. Wade and, with it, the constitutional right to an abortion. Conservative lawmakers in 13 states had crafted trigger laws that would automatically implement bans in the event a national right to abortion were struck down. Those state laws resulted in restrictions taking effect immediately after the court ruling, or shortly thereafter.",
      "States adopted triggers as part of Medicaid expansion to win over lawmakers skeptical of putting state dollars on the hook for a federal program unpopular with most Republicans.",
      "It's unclear what Trump and congressional Republicans will do with Medicaid after he takes office in January, but one indicator could be a recent recommendation from the Paragon Health Institute, a leading conservative policy organization led by former Trump health adviser Brian Blase.",
      "Paragon has proposed that starting in 2026 the federal government would phase down the 90% federal match for expansion until 2034, when it would reach parity with each state's federal match for its traditional enrollees. Under that plan, states could still get ACA Medicaid expansion funding but restrict coverage to enrollees with incomes up to the federal poverty level. Currently, to receive expansion funding, states must offer coverage to everyone up to 138% of the poverty level.",
      "Daniel Derksen, director of the Center for Rural Health at the University of Arizona, said it's unlikely Arizona would move to eliminate its trigger and make up for lost federal funds. \"It would be a tough sell right now as it would put a big strain on the budget,\" he said.",
      "Medicaid has been in the crosshairs of Republicans in Washington before. Republican congressional leaders in 2017 proposed legislation to cut federal expansion funding, a move that would have shifted billions in costs to states. That plan, part of a strategy to repeal Obamacare, ultimately failed.",

      "The group primarily promotes conservative views in the arenas of both the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs, particularly advocating for the latter to move towards a privatized healthcare system.",
      "Hegseth, the 44-year-old former co-host of \"Fox & Friends Weekends\" has faced a barrage of scrutiny involving his personal life and whether he has the experience to manage the Defense Department, the largest U.S. government agency, with a budget of $842 billion, almost 3 million employees and 750 military installations around the world.",
      "Margaret Hoover, host of PBS' \"Firing Line\" and a former adviser to Vets for Freedom, said in an\u00a0interview on CNN that Hegseth had managed the organization \"very poorly.\" Hoover expressed doubt about his ability to run the sprawling Defense Department when he had struggled with a staff of less than 10 people, and a budget of under $10 million.",
      "\"I don't know how he's going to run an organization with an $857 billion budget, and 3 million individuals, based on what I saw in those years,\" she said.",
      "In response to CBS News questions about the finances at Veterans for Freedom under his leadership, Hegseth merely said, \"I love working for the best in the military, and I'm privileged that the president of the United States would give me the opportunity to represent the best in the military.\"",
      "The whistleblower report received by The New Yorker also detailed multiple incidents where Hegseth was allegedly intoxicated on the job \"to the point of needing to be carried out of the organization's events.\"",
      "When pressed by CBS News on Capitol Hill about whether he was ever drunk while traveling on the job, Hegseth replied, \"Not gonna dignify that with a response.\"",
      "A source close to Hegseth acknowledged that people did \"occasionally\" have too much to drink at these events but maintained that the report's claims about Hegseth are false.",
      "\"The idea that a veterans organization of combat veterans who'd recently transitioned out of the military would drink or have too much to drink, that's not news,\" they said. \"That's the entire business model of the VFW [Veterans of Foreign Wars].\"",
      "The source said Hegseth has publicly acknowledged that he \"drank too much\" in the past, adding: \"That's not the kind of life that Pete lives right now. He certainly has matured a lot in the past decade.\"",
      "Last month, it was\u00a0revealed that Hegseth had secretly paid a financial settlement to a woman who had accused him of raping her in 2017 at a Republican women's banquet at the Hyatt Regency in Monterey, California. The city of Monterey released its 2017 investigation into Hegseth.",
      "The accuser, who has not been publicly named, reported she felt as though she had been drugged and recalled repeatedly saying \"no\" while in a hotel room with Hegseth. She alleged that he prevented her from leaving and was on top of her. CBS News does not publicly name individuals who have reported an alleged sexual assault unless that person chooses to publicly identify themselves.",
      "Timothy Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, told CBS News previously: \"This allegation was already investigated by the Monterey police department and they found no evidence for it.\"",
      "The Monterey Police Department forwarded its report about the alleged assault to the Monterey County District Attorney's Office for review back in 2017. Monterey County District Attorney Jeannine M. Pacioni said last month her office \"declined to file charges\" in January 2018 as none were \"supported by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 00:06:00 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.",
      "Yoon said his government withdrew military personnel following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected martial law, and the measure was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.",
      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",
      "In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

      "Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents that a pardon shouldn't wipe away the case \"as if it never occurred.\" Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn't a drug user in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted.",
      "The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing a case filed in California after Hunter Biden failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes. U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi in Los Angeles indicated he would dismiss the case once the pardon is formally received.",
      "Still, Scarsi was critical of the president's assertion that his son was singled out for political reasons, saying two judges had rejected similar arguments from his defense attorneys.",
      "The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Mr. Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20.",
      "In their own motion Tuesday, lawyers for President-elect Donald Trump cited the pardon in a request that Trump's conviction in the New York \"hush money\" case be dismissed.",
      "Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.",
      "In his statement announcing the pardon, Mr. Biden said that \"from the day I took office, I said I would not interfere with the Justice Department's decision-making, and I kept my word even as I have watched my son being selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted.\"",
      "Mr. Biden alleged that his son \"was treated differently\" than others in similar circumstances and that the charges were brought after \"several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election.\"",

      "Then in September, Hunter reached a plea deal on nine counts in a federal tax evasion case in Los Angeles. He faced up to 17 years in prison in that case prior to the pardon.",

      "\"Yesterday, in issuing a 10-year pardon to Hunter Biden that covers any and all crimes whether charged or uncharged, President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'\" they wrote, before claiming Trump was treated similarly.",

      "Their argument struck at the quality of the case against Trump, but centers largely on a wholly unique argument in the history of America's legal system. Trump's lawyers said his conviction in state court should not stand because he was elected president after his conviction.",
      "Prosecutors for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg have vowed to oppose the dismissal motion, and have been given a one-week deadline to file their response. They pursued the case amid a torrent of public threats of retribution by Trump's allies, and anonymous threats of violence by his supporters.",
      "Trump's lawyers argued in their filing that the Constitution requires dismissal of the case, even though it's already progressed though trial, because ongoing proceedings threaten to take Trump's attention from the presidency.",
      "\"Wrongly continuing proceedings in this failed lawfare case disrupts President Trump's transition efforts and his preparations to wield the full Article II executive power authorized by the Constitution pursuant to the overwhelming national mandate granted to him by the American people on November 5, 2024,\" wrote his attorneys, Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, each of whom are slated to take on high-level positions at the Justice Department after Trump is inaugurated.",
      "Trump's sentencing was recently postponed for a third time. After he was convicted in May, Justice Juan Merchan scheduled sentencing for July 11. In the interim, the Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling concluding that former presidents could not be charged for official acts, and evidence related to their official work as president could not be used as evidence against them.",
      "The first sentencing postponement came because Trump's attorneys wanted to file a motion to dismiss based on that Supreme Court ruling. Merchan has yet to rule on that motion.",
      "They then asked for and were granted a postponement of the second sentencing date, Sept. 18, arguing that it was too close to the election.",

    "story": [
      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

      "Senate Democrats also elevated Sen. Amy Klobuchar to the No. 3 post in Senate leadership, which opened up after Sen. Debbie Stabenow's decision to retire after more than two decades in the chamber. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey was elected to the fourth-ranking post.",

      "\"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",
      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\" Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Paris has been preparing for the reopening of the cathedral, which will be marked by days of celebration starting on Saturday. Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, along with Macron, will preside over Saturday's service, which will be broadcast on French television. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are expected to participate in the celebration, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Diocese of Paris, and one priest from each of the seven Eastern Catholic Churches, accompanied by Catholics from these communities, according to Notre Dame's website.",

    "summary": "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden on Sunday issued a sweeping pardon of his son Hunter, who was convicted earlier this year on federal gun and drug charges, and pleaded guilty to tax charges in California.",
      "The presidential pardoning process is one that has long courted controversy, especially since many presidents issue pardons when they are leaving the White House.",
      "One of the most famous \u2014and controversial\u2014 pardons in history happened less than one month into President Gerald Ford's term. On Sept. 8, 1974, Ford announced from the Oval Office that he would \"grant a full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United States which he, Richard Nixon, has committed or may have committed.\" Ford's own press secretary resigned over the pardon, and Ford's approval rating dropped 20 points over the following days. His approval rating never recovered and he went on to lose the 1976 presidential election.",
      "What is a presidential pardon?",
      "Presidents are granted the authority to issue pardons under Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution. The Constitution's framers were heavily influenced by the English legal tradition of pardon, which dates back to the 7th century, and Alexander Hamilton introduced the concept of the presidential pardon at the Constitutional Convention.",
      "Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution declares: \"The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.\"",
      "There are four different types of clemency that fall under the president's pardoning power: pardon, amnesty, commutation and reprieve.\u00a0 As outlined by the White House, a pardon releases a person from punishment and restores all civil liberties; amnesty is the same as the pardon but is extended to an entire class of individuals; commutation reduces the sentence imposed by a federal court, and a reprieve delays the imposition of a sentence or punishment.",
      "Pardons, however, may not be issued in cases of impeachment or if it is an \"offense against the United States,\" such as treason.",
      "The Office of the Pardon Attorney at the Department of Justice issues guidelines for the application of clemency, but presidents do not need to follow them.",
      "To be pardoned, a person must have been convicted in a United States District Court, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, or a military court-martial \u2014 so a president cannot issue a pardon for a state conviction.",
      "What does a pardon mean for the pardoned person?",
      "A pardon can help eliminate some of the consequences of conviction and restore a person's civil rights.",
      "According to the Justice Department, the offense is not removed from a person's criminal record when they are pardoned but instead the conviction and the pardon both appear on the record. But the pardon can be helpful in obtaining licenses, bonding or employment.",
      "Who has Biden pardoned while in office?",
      "Hunter Biden is the 26th person Mr. Biden has pardoned so far. Most pardons relate to drug offenses, a practice started by former President Barack Obama. In September 2023, Mr. Biden granted clemency for three Iranians who were accused of moving $6 billion in a restricted Iranian account as part of a prisoner swap.",
      "At this point in President-elect Donald Trump's first term, he had pardoned 29 people.",
      "Who did Trump pardon during his first term?",
      "Trump issued a slew of pardons on Jan. 19, 2021, shortly before he left office. Trump pardoned 74 people and commuted the sentences of another 70.",
      "Among those pardoned were Steve Bannon, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy, Albert J. Pirro and rapper Lil Wayne.",
      "Prior to those pardons, Trump pardoned more than 30 people in December 2020, including his son-in-law Jared Kushner's father, Charles Kushner, who had been convicted of witness tampering, tax evasion and illegal campaign contributions in 2005. Ahead of his second term, Trump has nominated Charles Kushner to be the ambassador to France.",
      "Earlier in his term, Trump pardoned Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio,\u00a0Dinesh D'Souza, his first national security adviser Michael Flynn, former George W. Bush aide I. Lewis \"Scooter\" Libby and Oregon ranchers Dwight L. Hammond and Steve D. Hammond.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued a full pardon for Alice Marie Johnson, whose sentence he had commuted in 2018 after lobbying from Kim Kardashian. Johnson is a great-grandmother who had served 22 years in federal prison for what was a first-time criminal offense, which had come to Kardashian's attention.",
      "In total over four years in office, Trump issued 237 acts of clemency, including 143 pardons and 94 commutations. The only presidents since 1900 who issued fewer acts of clemency were George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, according to the\u00a0Pew Research Center.",
      "Who did Obama pardon while in office?",
      "Obama issued 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations while in office, including for 568 people who were serving life sentences. In 2014, Obama launched the Clemency Initiative, which allowed federal prisoners to apply for leniency, especially those serving for nonviolent drug offenses. In the\u00a0Obama White House archives, his administration touts that those whose sentences were commuted were \"incarcerated under outdated and unduly harsh sentencing laws.\"",
      "Although Obama encouraged prisoners to apply for leniency under the Clemency Initiative, a report by the Justice Department Inspector General in 2018 found that initiative was poorly planned and not implemented properly, while also suffering from poor communication and bureaucratic feuds.",
      "\"We found that the Department did not effectively plan, implement, or manage the Initiative at the outset,\" Inspector General Michael Horowitz wrote in the report.",
      "Which president has pardoned the most people in history?",
      "President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who served 13 years in office, issued the most pardons: 3,687.",
      "Have past presidents pardoned family members?",
      "Although Mr. Biden is the first president to pardon his son, he is not the first to pardon a family member. Former President Bill Clinton pardoned his brother Roger Clinton and Trump pardoned Charles Kushner, his son-in-law's father.",
      "Abraham Lincoln, meanwhile, pardoned his sister-in-law, Emilie Todd Helm, who was the widow of a Confederate general, under the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction.",
      "Can a president issue a preemptive pardon?",
      "Ford's infamous pardon of Nixon was a preemptive pardon, since Nixon had not been charged with a crime. Former President Jimmy Carter also issued preemptive pardons for Vietnam draft evaders, as did Lincoln in the Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction, which allowed for former Confederates to be pardoned if they took an oath to the U.S.",
      "President George H.W. Bush also pardoned his secretary of defense, Caspar Weinberger, along with five others, for his alleged role in the Iran-Contra scandal after he was indicted but before his trial.",
      "Mr. Biden's pardon of Hunter covers any crimes Hunter Biden may have committed from Jan. 1, 2014, through Dec. 1, 2024, even if he has not yet been charged. Hunter Biden's first plea agreement in Delaware fell apart because his lawyers sought full immunity from future prosecution.",
      "Can another president undo a previous presidential pardon?",
      "The pardon language in Article II of the Constitution does not include any language about revoking pardons, although only a few presidents have exercised that power.",
      "On President Andrew Johnson's last day in office, he issued several pardons \u2014 three of which President Ulysses S. Grant reversed on his first day by calling back the U.S. Marshal so they were never delivered. A fourth was allowed to stand since it had been delivered.",
      "According to Washington Monthly, an 1868 textbook by Supreme Court Associate Justice Joseph Story on the Constitution says a presidential pardon can be revoked if the president was impeached. In recent history, both Clinton and Trump have been impeached \u2014 although their pardons did stand after their terms.",
      "Former President George W. Bush, meanwhile, revoked one of his own pardons. In December 2008, shortly before leaving office, Bush pardoned 19 people, including\u00a0 Isaac Robert Toussie of Brooklyn, N.Y., who had been convicted of making false statements to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and of mail fraud.",
      "One day later, Bush reversed the decision, with White House press secretary Dana Perino citing \"information that has subsequently come to light,\" including on the extent and nature of Toussie's prior criminal offenses. She also said that neither the White House counsel's office nor the president had been aware of a political contribution by Toussie's father that \"might create an appearance of impropriety.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans have celebrated holding onto their narrow majority in the House, adding to their flip of the Senate and the White House for a trifecta in Washington next year. But President-elect Donald Trump's selection of a number of House Republicans to fill top posts in his administration is pulling from an already shallow bench, temporarily whittling the GOP majority down further as Trump takes office in January.",
      "Just one House race remains to be decided nearly four weeks after Election Day, with 99% of the vote counted in California's 13th Congressional District, where Democrat Adam Gray is leading GOP Rep. John Duarte. Last week, victories in another California district, along with one in Iowa brought the balance of power in the chamber to 220-214.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump has tapped a handful of House Republicans for top positions in his administration. In the week following the election, the president-elect made two selections from the House, with GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik of New York as ambassador to the U.N., and Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida as national security adviser.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, while outlining the GOP agenda following the picks last month, said the president-elect \"fully understands and appreciates the math here,\" noting that he didn't expect the conference would lose any more members to Trump's administration.",
      "\"Every single vote will count because if someone gets ill or has a car accident or a late flight on their plane then it affects the votes on the floor,\" Johnson said.",
      "Then came Trump's pick of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, setting up three vacancies early in the new Congress. Gaetz resigned his seat immediately, hours after Trump announced his intent to nominate him.",
      "\"I told President Trump, 'enough already, you've got to give me some relief,'\" Johnson said on Fox News after Trump selected Gaetz for the role. \"I've got to maintain this majority.\"",
      "Though Gaetz has since withdrawn from consideration for the post, facing intense scrutiny over a House Ethics Committee investigation into alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, he's said he does not intend to serve in the 119th Congress, giving Johnson another unwelcome vacancy.",
      "Johnson expressed optimism at the time of Gaetz' selection that with his immediate resignation from the chamber, his seat could be filled by the start of the new Congress, citing Florida state law's process. But Gov. Ron DeSantis\u00a0set the primary for Jan. 28, and the general election for April 1, which he said was the earliest date the special election could take place. Florida's secretary of state said the election was being conducted \"as quickly as statutorily possible.\"",
      "Waltz' seat is also set for an April 1 general election in Florida. And the special election for Stefanik's seat could take up to 90 days after she resigns. The dynamic could mean for months in the early days of the president-elect's second term, Republicans could have a majority that is as low as one or two seats, meaning that if all House members are present, Johnson could need the support of every single Republican. If he has a three-seat majority, he could afford to lose one Republican on some votes.",
      "The outcome may spell trouble for the GOP's ability to act on the mandate that Republicans have claimed since Trump's victory in the presidential election. (Although Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in both the electoral and popular votes, he did not win a majority of American voters.) House Republican leadership has struggled in recent years to keep the conference united on key priorities, with a reliable group of detractors on its right flank. While the conservatives, many of whom are Trump loyalists, may be more inclined to stay in line under a Trump administration than during President Biden's time in office, Johnson could face opposition from moderates in his party.",
      "House Republicans like Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska, David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington have previously been critical of Trump and could break with the party on some issues, imperiling some early legislative action. Bacon refused to back the president-elect during the primary, while Valadao and Newhouse are the two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in 2021. After the election, Rep. Mike Lawler of New York told USA Today that he would be willing to speak out against Trump amid GOP control of Washington to work in the best interest of his constituents.",
      "\"When I agree with the president, I'll say it. If I disagree on something, I will say that, too,\" Lawler said.",
      "Still, the exceedingly narrow majority created by Trump's appointments is expected to be short-lived, since all three seats are in safely Republican districts. Johnson expressed confidence that Republicans would be able to work with a smaller majority for as long is necessary, while pledging to \"be very aggressive\" and move forward with Trump's agenda beginning on Day One.",

    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "title": "Boeing whistleblower sounds alarm over safety at satellite factory",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 19:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Craig Garriott has built satellites for Boeing for nearly three decades.",
    "story": [
      "Whether it's providing internet to storm-ravaged communities or supporting American troops at war, Craig Garriott has long believed the satellites he builds for Boeing helped protect lives.",
      "Now, Garriott, 53, says, it's the lives of hundreds of technicians at the Boeing facility where he has worked for nearly three decades that need protecting from company management.",
      "\"They've taken the focus off quality, the focus off the people on the floor, and they've put it completely on profit and going fast,\" Garriott said in an exclusive interview with CBS News senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave. \"I'm afraid with Boeing in the hands that it's in now down here, they're not gonna listen to me until somebody dies.\"",
      "He said efforts by Boeing executives to boost production at the company's Los Angeles-area military and commercial satellite plant have led to a \"toxic culture\" that has put workers there in danger. Garriott recalled how a four-ton satellite estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars crashed to the factory floor after it wasn't properly secured \u2014 an incident so catastrophic he compared it to \"a plane falling out of the sky.\"",
      "\"One person was underneath that satellite and they barely got out,\" said Garriott, who also represents 600 hourly workers as the head of the local carpenters union. \"It's the worst thing that can possibly happen on a site.\"",
      "A Boeing spokesperson did not respond to specific questions about the incident. In a statement to CBS News, the spokesperson said, \"Boeing is dedicated to the safety of its employees, and all employees are empowered and encouraged to report any safety concerns.\"",
      "Garriott's allegations echo concerns raised by multiple whistleblowers who have worked on Boeing's commercial airliners, including the troubled 737 MAX. And they add to struggles already facing Boeing's space division.",
      "The most high-profile Boeing space failure occurred in September, when the company's Starliner spacecraft experienced a cascade of technical troubles on a manned test flight to the International Space Station. NASA considered the return flight too risky, and sent it back to Earth without the two astronauts it had planned to shuttle home. Those astronauts will instead travel back next year in a capsule built by rival SpaceX and its CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Tapped by President-elect Trump to lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, Musk is set to potentially wield enormous influence over lucrative space and defense contracts, which could put Boeing at a further disadvantage.",
      "Boeing, the company that helped put a man on the moon, is now exploring a new course \u2014 indicating it may sell off parts of its space business, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal. During Boeing's October earnings call, new CEO Kelly Ortberg suggested he was reevaluating the company's portfolio.",
      "\"We're better off doing less and doing it well than doing more and not doing it well,\" Ortberg said.",
      "The Boeing spokesperson did not respond to questions about how the company views competition from SpaceX or about steps it is taking to prepare for the incoming administration.",
      "Garriott estimates he's raised 300-400 safety violations over past year",
      "Acquired by Boeing in 2000, the satellite manufacturing facility has long been considered one of Boeing's more stable business units. It relies in part on a union workforce that Garriott said is responsible for constructing and testing satellites and their component parts.",
      "\"This is perhaps the most technical group of hourly people that you'll probably find on this planet,\" said Garriott, who estimated he's raised between 300 and 400 safety violations over the past year. Those complaints, he said, range from obstructed fire extinguishers and fire alarms to concerns over heavy machinery blocking exits and trapping workers in certain parts of the factory.",
      "In October, union workers filed a complaint with the Occupational Health and Safety Administration that, according to Garriott, highlighted unsafe conditions on the factory floor.",
      "Another technician at the facility, who spoke to CBS News on the condition he remain anonymous to protect his job, said safety had become \"an afterthought\" and quality had \"degraded\" over the past five to six years.",
      "\"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker\"",
      "Garriott sued Boeing in April alleging company management retaliated against him for raising safety issues. He said he's been harassed by leadership at the facility and has been the target of dozens of corporate investigations that he says turned up nothing and were only meant to intimidate him.",
      "\"When I first started at Boeing, the guys that spoke up and said, 'Hey, this doesn't feel right,' those guys were revered,\" Garriott said. \"You speak up now, you're a troublemaker.\"",
      "In a statement, Boeing said it investigated Garriott's claims and disputed the allegations he made in his lawsuit.",
      "'We have strict policies prohibiting retaliation toward employees who raise concerns, and Boeing did not retaliate against Mr. Garriott,\" the Boeing spokesperson said.",
      "Garriott is the latest whistleblower claiming the company retaliated against him after raising safety concerns. John Barnett, a former quality manager at the company's 787 Dreamliner factory, died by suicide in March while in Charleston, South Carolina, giving testimony in his whistleblower retaliation case.",
      "Barnett's mother, Vicky Stokes, told CBS News in April she holds the aircraft manufacturing giant responsible for the grinding treatment that ultimately left her son despondent.",
      "\"If this hadn't gone on so long, I'd still have my son, and my sons would have their brother and we wouldn't be sitting here. So in that respect, I do,\" Stokes said when asked if she places some of the blame for her son's death on Boeing.",
      "In June, former Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun told lawmakers on the Senate investigations subcommittee that Boeing's culture is \"far from perfect,\" but said the company is \"committed to making sure every employee feels empowered to speak up if there is a problem.\" He also said Boeing is working on improving \"transparency and accountability, while elevating employee engagement.\"",
      "Garriott said although his family fears he will endure further reprisals from Boeing, he's now speaking out publicly in an effort to improve conditions for workers he said he took an oath as union head to protect.",
      "\"I'm not gonna stop till I know that Boeing understands that these people mean something, they matter,\" Garriott said, urging company executives to open up a dialogue with workers on the factory floor. \"Make 'em feel like they matter. Make 'em feel like their safety matters.\"",

    "title": "Bluesky says X's \"partisan microphone\" are driving users to it",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Dec 2024 15:59:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Bluesky has added millions of new subscribers in the last month as some users leave X. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It's unusual for a new social media service to get a foothold in a marketplace entrenched by the likes of X (formerly Twitter), Instagram and TikTok which, dominate people's phones. But Bluesky, a nearly 2-year-old app, is now grabbing attention amid a recent surge of new users, which the company says is likely due to growing frustrations with X.",
      "While the platform has grown since it opened as an invite-only service in February 2023, its membership snowballed following the November 5 presidential election. Bluesky currently has more than 22 million users, up from about 12 million people in mid-October, according to the company's data.",
      "Bluesky believes its recent growth is partly due to changes at X under billionaire owner Elon Musk, according to Bluesky Chief Operating Officer Rose Wang, who recently spoke to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Musk, who bought Twitter in 2022 for $44 billion, has overhauled the service, changing its name to X\u00a0and\u00a0prioritizing accounts from people who pay for a blue checkmark \u2014 although accounts with more than 2,500 \"verified subscriber followers\" get access to Premium features for free.",
      "Ad sales almost immediately softened after Musk took over the platform, with companies including Apple, Coca-Cola and Disney removing paid ads from X\u00a0last year. Most recently, The Guardian said it would no longer be posting its content under its official account on X. In its announcement, the British newspaper described X as \"toxic,\" adding that the platform has been used by Musk to shape political discourse.",
      "Musk became one of the most viral voices on elections during the 2024 campaign, frequently sharing conspiratorial narratives while promoting President-elect Donald Trump, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "When Twitter became X, \"it was no longer a public town square, and now it's more of a partisan microphone,\" Wang said, adding, \"that is a big reason why we think people are coming over.\"",
      "X didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is the difference between X and Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky resembles the \"old Twitter\" in terms of layout and content,\u00a0wrote\u00a0PCWorld tech writer Dave Parrack in a recent column. He added, \"Bluesky feels like a safe haven. There's very little trolling, and when it does happen, people aren't biting.\"",
      "Bluesky users can find people to follow through so-called \"starter packs,\" or curated lists of people to follow by interest or fields, such as this group of garden writers. That enables users to quickly build a feed of posts from people that they pick, rather than being fed content by a corporate algorithm, the company says.",
      "Because people can tailor their interests and connect with other like-minded users, there's more interaction on the service than on X, according to Wang.",
      "Some companies are also reporting more engagement with their posts on the Bluesky app versus rival platforms. An executive for The Boston Globe, for instance\u00a0noted\u00a0that the newspaper's posts on Bluesky receive three times the traffic as on Meta's Threads.",
      "\"Thirty percent of users Bluesky are posters versus 1% on Twitter,\" Wang said.",
      "Even so, it's questionable whether Bluesky's jump in new users is making much of a dent in X's consumer base.",
      "The presidential election delivered a surge in traffic to Musk's social media service, according to tracking service Similarweb. It found that more than 46 million U.S. users visited X on November 6, the day after President-elect Donald Trump's win \u2014 more than any day in the prior year. About 115,000 people in the U.S. deactivated their accounts on X that same day, its data shows.",
      "How Bluesky makes money",
      "While Bluesky's user base is growing quickly, the company remains small in terms of its funding and staff, which Wang describes as \"a tiny team of 20\" employees, including herself and CEO Jay Graber. The service was created by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, although the business has been independent since 2021.",
      "In October, the company\u00a0raised $15 million in venture funding, which followed a seed round of $8 million in 2023. Wang noted that Bluesky is focused on figuring out how to sustain its business, which will soon include new revenue streams from subscriptions and financial transactions.",
      "\"We are launching subscriptions at the end of this year,\" Wang noted. \"It'll be custom aesthetics, custom avatar frames, maybe more video uploads.\"",
      "The company is also planning to enable financial transactions between users, such as if a game designer wants to sell his or her products to Bluesky users. The service would take a portion of the payment, Wang noted.",
      "Bluesky doesn't accept advertising, nor has it marketed itself in the wake of Musk's takeover of Twitter, she added.",
      "To be sure, Bluesky may never achieve the size of bigger social media networks, which advertisers flock to in order to reach much larger groups of users. For instance, Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, had more than 3 billion daily users across its apps in the most recent quarter, and\u00a0booked almost $40 billion in revenue during that time.",
      "How do you sign up for Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky opened as an invitation-only platform in February 2023, but anyone can now sign up for the service.",
      "User handles on the service are a little bit different than X or other social media networks because they end with the site's domain, .bsky.social. Posts are limited to 300 characters, 20 more than on X. Photos and videos can also uploaded, though videos can't be longer than 60 seconds. GIFs and emojis are available, too.",
      "As with other platforms, you can tag people on Bluesky by typing \"@\" before their username, you can like posts by tapping a heart icon, and use hashtags to highlight a theme. Bluesky has added a\u00a0menu\u00a0to hashtags, so that when users click on one they'll get different options for seeing, or muting, posts on a particular topic.",
      "\"It's more of a community space \u2014 it's more of a Reddit model, where you land in those cosy corners,\" Wang added. \"At the end of the day it's all about the people, and what I encourage people to do is just come to Bluesky, give it a chance and see for yourself what the experience is like.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 21:17:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are emerging in the hours after a gunman shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson outside of a Manhattan hotel. Here's what we know.",
    "story": [
      "UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was shot and killed Wednesday morning outside of a hotel in New York City, police said. A manhunt is underway to find the gunman, who fled the scene\u00a0on a bike into Central Park.",
      "Here is what we know so far.",
      "Shooting appeared to be targeted attack",
      "Thompson, 50, suffered gunshot wounds to the back and to the leg at around 6:45 a.m. ET, while outside of the Hilton Midtown hotel in a busy section of Manhattan. Police said they believe this was not a random attack, and that Thompson was targeted. Authorities are searching for a motive.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened by this morning's events in the area and our thoughts are with all affected by the tragedy,\" a spokesperson for the hotel said in a statement.",
      "Investigators have video of the shooting in which the gunman appeared to wait for Thompson for several minutes prior to firing, New York City Police Commissioner\u00a0Jessica Tisch\u00a0said at a briefing. The gunman arrived at the shooting location on foot about five minutes before Thompson arrived.",
      "The suspect approached Thompson from behind and fired the gun at least twice, striking him in the back and the right calf, according to the police commissioner. The shooter used a silencer, which is a device that acts like a muzzle to reduce the sound of a gunshot. Video shows the suspect fire the gun initially and step toward Thompson, said NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. The gun appeared to malfunction, but the shooter cleared the jam fairly quickly before firing again. The CEO was not robbed.",
      "\"I want to be clear. At this time, every indication is that this was a premeditated, preplanned, targeted attack,\" Tisch said.",
      "The commissioner said the gunman ignored multiple passersby while seemingly lying in wait for Thompson. Another person is also seen in security footage standing against the side of the building between the gunman and Thompson, but just outside of the line of fire. The gunman does not appear to move from his position facing Thompson as the person, apparently realizing there has been a shooting, looks up from their phone and hurries away.",
      "Police did not respond directly when asked whether Thompson had known enemies prior to his death or been blamed for a health insurance recipient's lack of coverage under UnitedHealthcare \u2014 since the latter issue led to protests in Minnesota, where the company is headquartered and where Thompson lived, over the summer. They said investigators were \"looking at everything,\" including the executive's social media, and interviewing his colleagues and family members to work out what circumstances may have led to the incident. NYPD is also connecting with law enforcement in Minnesota.",
      "The shooting happened ahead of an investors conference that UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, was scheduled to host Wednesday morning at the Hilton, according to a spokesperson for the subsidiary. Thompson had worked for UnitedHealthcare since 2004 and served as its CEO since 2021.",
      "Thompson was not a guest at the Hilton hotel, Tisch said. He had been staying at the Marriott across the street and was headed to the Hilton on Wednesday morning for the conference, which was set to begin at 8 a.m. Kenny said police had reached out to Thompson's colleagues for guidance as to why he was going early to the meeting, but suggested the CEO may have intended to help set up for the event, which UnitedHealthcare canceled after the shooting.",
      "A senior NYPD official told CBS News the fact that the gunman got to the shooting location only minutes before Thompson indicates he knew where the CEO was staying, and when he would arrive at the conference.",
      "Surveillance images released by the NYPD showed the suspect minutes before the shooting at a Starbucks two blocks from the shooting. Police told CBS News they found unspecified \"forensic evidence\" at the Starbucks and that items recovered there are being tested for possible DNA and fingerprints by the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit.",
      "New York City Police Department Officers who responded to the 911 call reporting the shooting found Thompson unconscious and unresponsive when they arrived, the New York City Police Department said. Emergency medical services personnel transported him to Mount Sinai West, which is close by, but Thompson succumbed to his injuries. He was pronounced dead at the hospital, according to NYPD.",
      "At the scene, police recovered three live rounds and three discharged shell casings.",
      "Suspect fled into Central Park",
      "After the shooting, the suspect rode away on a bike into Central Park, authorities said at the briefing Wednesday. Police told CBS News a video canvass showed the suspect exiting the west side of the park somewhere between 70th and 80th streets. Police are examining surveillance video of what appears to be the suspect at 6:59 a.m. riding a bike on West 85th Street.",
      "A cellphone police said had \"investigative value\" was recovered in the alleyway at the scene of the shooting, and authorities are processing it forensically to see if it is connected to the shooter.",
      "Authorities initially said the suspect used an electric Citi Bike to get away, but Lyft, which owns and operates Citi Bike, later said the NYPD informed the company a Citi Bike hadn't been used. A spokesperson for Lyft previously said the company was \"ready to assist\" with the investigation.",
      "Police have not identified suspect",
      "The suspect remained at large as of midday Wednesday. Police sources described him as a white male, wearing a tan-colored jacket, a black face mask and black-and-white sneakers. He also carried a grey backpack.",
      "Police sources said several hours after the shooting took place that officers were continuing to parse surveillance images and canvass the area for additional video in efforts to track down the gunman. Investigators and security at UnitedHealthcare were also reviewing files for any previous threats, or records of disgruntled or recently fired workers, as they tried to piece together a possible motive, a law enforcement source said.",
      "\"We will not rest until we arrest and apprehend the shooter in this case,\" Tisch said.",
      "A witness said he was inside of his car when he heard the gunshot, CBS News New York reported. The witness recalled seeing a man running away with a gun in his hand, according to the station.",
      "\"I was looking at my phone and I hear the shot,\" the witness told CBS News New York \"I was shocked, it's the first time I've ever seen a crime right in front of me. Now I fear he could shoot me too.\"",
      "Anyone with information about the shooting has been asked to contact the NYPD through its Crime Stoppers hotline. They can also report tips anonymously online. The police department is offering a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the suspect's arrest and conviction.",
      "Thompson's long history at UnitedHealth Group",
      "Thompson was named CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the insurance branch of UnitedHealth Group, in April 2021. But he was a veteran employee of the company who held a number of leadership positions over his multi-decade tenure. Before taking on this latest executive role, he served as CEO of the company's government programs, like Medicare and retirement initiatives, in addition to community and state programs that provide Medicaid and other health coverage to millions.",
      "When he was appointed to lead UnitedHealthcare in 2021, the company said in\u00a0its announcement\u00a0that Thompson would be responsible for driving \"continued growth across the global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses while continuing the company's focus on ensuring access to high-quality, affordable health care.\"",
      "UnitedHealth Group said the company was \"deeply saddened and shocked\" by Thompson's death in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him,\" the statement said. \"We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "Thompson's total compensation was $10.2 million in 2023, according to UnitedHealth Group's 2024 proxy statement. His earnings topped $9.8 million in 2022 and $9.6 million in 2021, according to the company.",
      "Recent layoffs at UnitedHealth Group",
      "Optum, another subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group focused on patient services, is currently undergoing a series of layoffs, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. The company in September announced hundreds of job cuts in New Jersey, California and Ohio, the bulk of which were set to take effect in December. State laws in those three places required the employer to disclose the cuts, so layoffs could have theoretically been more widespread but unreported. CBS News contacted UnitedHealth Group for more information.",
      "Industry and family reaction",
      "Thompson's family released a statement, saying: \"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian. Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Department report marked the conclusion of an investigation that began six months after Tyre Nichols was kicked, punched and hit with a police baton as five officers\u200b tried to arrest him after he fled a traffic stop.",
    "story": [
      "The Memphis Police Department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people, according to the findings of a U.S. Department of Justice investigation launched after the beating death of Tyre Nichols after a traffic stop in 2023.",
      "A report released Wednesday marked the conclusion of the investigation that began six months after Nichols was kicked, punched and hit with a police baton as five officers tried to arrest him after he fled a traffic stop.",
      "The report says that \"Memphis police officers regularly violate the rights of the people they are sworn to serve.\"",
      "\"The people of Memphis deserve a police department and city that protects their civil and constitutional rights, garners trust and keeps them safe,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said in an emailed statement.",
      "The city said in a letter released earlier Wednesday that it would not agree to negotiate federal oversight of its police department until it could review and challenge results of the investigation.",
      "City officials had no immediate comment on the report but said they plan to hold a news conference Thursday after Justice Department officials hold their own news conference in Memphis on Thursday morning to address the findings.",
      "Police video showed officers pepper spraying Nichols and hitting him with a Taser before he ran away from a traffic stop. Five officers chased down Nichols and kicked, punched and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home as he called out for his mother. The video showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled with his injuries.",
      "Nichols died on Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. The five officers \u2014 Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith \u2014 were fired, charged in state court with murder, and indicted by a federal grand jury on civil rights and witness tampering charges.",
      "Nichols was Black, as are the former officers. His death led to national protests, raised the volume on calls for police reforms in the U.S., and directed intense scrutiny towards the police department in Memphis, a majority Black city.",
      "The report specifically mentions the Nichols case, and it addresses the police department's practice of using traffic stops to address violent crime. The police department has encouraged officers in specialized units, task forces, and on patrol to prioritize street enforcement, and officers and community members have described this approach as \"saturation,\" or flooding neighborhoods with traffic stops, the report said.",
      "\"This strategy involves frequent contact with the public and gives wide discretion to officers, which requires close supervision and clear rules to direct officers' activity,\" the report said. \"But MPD does not ensure that officers conduct themselves in a lawful manner.\"",
      "The report said prosecutors and judges told federal investigators that officers do not understand the constitutional limits on their authority. Officers stop and detain people without adequate justification, and they conduct invasive searches of people and cars, the report said.",
      "\"Black people in Memphis disproportionately experience these violations,\" the report said. \"MPD has never assessed its practices for evidence of discrimination. We found that officers treat Black people more harshly than white people who engage in similar conduct.\"",
      "The investigation found that Memphis officers resort to force likely to cause pain or injury \"almost immediately in response to low-level, nonviolent offenses, even when people are not aggressive.\"",
      "The report says officers pepper sprayed, kicked and fired a Taser at an unarmed man with a mental illness who tried to take a $2 soda from a gas station. By the end of an encounter outside the gas station, at least nine police cars and 12 officers had responded to the incident, for which the man served two days in jail for theft and disorderly conduct.",
      "In a letter to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division released earlier Wednesday, Memphis City Attorney Tannera George Gibson said the city had received a request from the DOJ to enter into an agreement that would require it to \"negotiate a consent decree aimed at institutional police and emergency services.\"",
      "A consent decree is an agreement requiring reforms that are overseen by an independent monitor and are approved by a federal judge. The federal oversight can continue for years, and violations could result in fines paid by the city.",
      "It remains to be seen what will happen to attempts to reach such agreements between cities and the Justice Department once President-elect Donald Trump returns to office and installs new department leadership. The Justice Department under the first Trump administration curtailed the use of consent decrees, and the Republican president-elect is expected to again radically reshape the department's priorities around civil rights.",
      "\"Until the City has had the opportunity to review, analyze, and challenge the specific allegations that support your forthcoming findings report, the City cannot \u2014 and will not \u2014 agree to work toward or enter into a consent decree that will likely be in place for years to come and will cost the residents of Memphis hundreds of millions of dollars,\" the letter said.",
      "The officers in the Nichols case were part of a crime suppression team called the Scorpion Unit, which was disbanded after Nichols' death. The team targeted drugs, illegal guns and violent offenders, with the goal of amassing arrest numbers, while sometimes using force against unarmed people.",
      "Memphis police never adopted policies and procedures to direct the unit, despite alarms that it was minimally supervised, according to the Justice Department report. Some prosecutors told department investigators that there were some \"outrageous\" inconsistences between body camera footage and arrest reports, and if the cases went to trial, they would be \"laughed out of court.\" The report found that the unit's misconduct led to dozens of criminal cases being dismissed.",
      "In court proceedings dealing with Nichols' death, Martin and Mills pleaded guilty to the federal charges under deals with prosecutors. The other three officers were convicted in early October of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating. Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges of using excessive force and being indifferent to Nichols' serious injuries.",
      "Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but he was convicted of two lesser charges of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. The five men face sentencing by a federal judge in the coming months.",
      "Martin and Mills also are expected to change their not guilty pleas in state court, according to lawyers involved in the case. Bean, Haley and Smith have also pleaded not guilty to state charges of second-degree murder. A trial in the state case has been set for April 28.",
      "Justice Department investigators have targeted other cities with similar probes in recent years, including Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd, and Louisville, Kentucky, following an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor.",
      "In its letter, the city of Memphis said the DOJ's investigation \"only took 17 months to complete, compared to an average of 2-3 years in almost every other instance, implying a rush to judgment.\"",

    "summary": "Here's what we know about UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, who was shot to death in Manhattan on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was shot to death Wednesday outside the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan, where the company was hosting an investor day.",
      "Thompson, 50, was\u00a0named\u00a0CEO of UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth Group's insurance arm, in April 2021. He first joined UnitedHealth Group in 2004 and had previously served as CEO of the company's government programs, including Medicare and retiree coverage, and community and state programs providing Medicaid and other types of coverage to millions of individuals.",
      "In his most recent role as CEO of UnitedHealthcare, he was responsible for leading growth across the company's global, employer, individual, specialty and government benefits businesses, according to a 2021 company statement announcing his appointment.",
      "\"Brian's experience, relationships and values make him especially well-suited to help UnitedHealthcare improve how health care works for consumers, physicians, employers, governments and our other partners, leading to continued and sustained long-term growth,\" UnitedHealth Group CEO Andrew Witty said at the time.",
      "Thompson held other positions over his 20 years at the company, including chief financial officer for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual, Community and State and Medicare and Retirement businesses. He also served as the financial controller for UnitedHealthcare's Employer and Individual business and was a director in the company's corporate development division.",
      "A low-key CEO",
      "For a top executive at a $562 billion company that affects how millions of Americans get health care, Thompson kept a relatively low profile. At an investor meeting last year, he outlined UnitedHealth's shift to \"value-based care,\" paying doctors and other caregivers to keep patients healthy, rather than focusing on treating them when they get sick.",
      "\"Health care should be easier for people,\" Thompson said at the time. \"We are cognizant of the challenges. But navigating a future through value-based care unlocks a situation where the \u2026 family doesn't have to make the decisions on their own.\"",
      "In 2023, Thompson earned total compensation of $10.2 million, according to a\u00a0disclosure\u00a0by UnitedHealth Group.",
      "Before joining UnitedHealth Group, Thompson worked as a certified public accountant at accounting firm PwC, according to his biography on networking site LinkedIn. Thompson graduated from the University of Iowa in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in business administration and most recently resided in Maple Grove, Minnesota.",
      "Following the shooting, UnitedHealthcare canceled its Wednesday meeting with Wall Street analysts and investors, which Thompson had been scheduled to attend.",
      "\"We are deeply saddened and shocked at the passing of our dear friend and colleague Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare,\" UnitedHealth Group said in a statement. \"Brian was a highly respected colleague and friend to all who worked with him. We are working closely with the New York Police Department and ask for your patience and understanding during this difficult time. Our hearts go out to Brian's family and all who were close to him.\"",
      "Thompson is survived by his wife, Paulette Thompson, and two sons.",
      "\"We are shattered to hear about the senseless killing of our beloved Brian,\" Thompson's wife said in a statement provided to CBS News by her sister. \"Brian was an incredibly loving, generous, talented man who truly lived life to the fullest and touched so many lives. Most importantly, Brian was an incredibly loving father to our two sons and will be greatly missed. We appreciate your well wishes and request complete privacy as our family moves through this difficult time.\"",
      "Minnesota leaders express shock",
      "Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also weighed in on Thompson's death. \"This is a shocking and devastating loss for our whole community. 'Shocking' is the only word I can find at the moment,\" he said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added in a post on social media that Thompson was \"a great man.\"",
      "Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar expressed her condolences for Thompson's family and for United Healthcare employees in the state, calling the shooting \"a horrifying and shocking act of violence\" in a post on X.",
      "In his own post, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called Thompson's death \"a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota.\"",

      "New York \u2014 A manhunt is underway in New York for the gunman who shot and killed UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson on Wednesday morning in what authorities said appeared to be a targeted attack.",
      "Thompson, 50, was shot multiple times around 6:45 a.m. outside the Hilton Midtown hotel on Sixth Avenue near West 54th Street in New York City, officials said at a press conference Wednesday. Thompson was not a guest at the Hilton but was staying at another hotel nearby and walking to the Hilton for a corporate event when he was attacked.",
      "The shooting happened ahead of an investors conference that UnitedHealth Group, the parent company of UnitedHealthcare, was scheduled to host on Wednesday at the Hilton, according to a spokesperson for the subsidiary.",
      "What we know about the suspect in CEO shooting",
      "The suspect has not been identified. He is a light-skinned man and was wearing a grey colored backpack, which NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny described as \"very distinctive.\" Kenny said the gunman was also wearing a light brown or cream-colored jacket, black face mask and black-and-white sneakers.",
      "The suspect appeared to be lying in wait for Thompson for several minutes, newly sworn-in Police Commissioner\u00a0Jessica Tisch\u00a0said during Wednesday's news conference. A senior NYPD official told CBS News that the suspect's arrival before Thompson indicates he knew where the CEO was staying and when he would arrive at the conference.",
      "\"Based on the evidence we have so far it does appear that the victim was specifically targeted, but we don't know why,\" Kenny said.",
      "Thompson was staying at another hotel across the street, Kenny said. He left his hotel shortly after 6:40 to head over to the Hilton. Kenny said police are speaking to Thompson's coworkers to understand why he was headed to the hotel so early, but said the CEO was in charge of the conference and may have been going over to help set up.",
      "The suspect approached Thompson from behind at 6:44 a.m., then shot him at least once in the back and once in the right calf. A security camera captured the incident.",
      "Kenny said the suspect appeared to be proficient in the use of firearms, noting that the suspect appeared to quickly fix a jam in his weapon.\u00a0The suspect also had a silencer on the weapon, the NYPD said.",
      "The suspect first fled on foot before getting on a bike. Tisch initially said the suspect used an electronic Citi Bike to get away, but Lyft said the NYPD later told the company, which owns and operates Citi Bike, that was not the case. Police are attempting to track the suspect through video canvass, Kenny said. A spokesperson for Lyft had previously said the company was \"ready to assist\" with the investigation.",
      "The suspect was seen in Central Park and the police video canvass showed him exiting the west side of the park somewhere between 70th and 80th streets. Police are examining surveillance video of what appears to be the suspect at 6:59 a.m. riding a bike on West 85th Street.",
      "What evidence have police found?",
      "Three live 9 mm rounds and three discharged 9 mm shell casings were recovered from the scene, Kenny said. Police also found a cellphone along the route the suspect used to flee the scene. Police are doing a forensic analysis of the device to determine if it belongs to the suspect, Kenny said. Police told CBS News the phone has \"investigative value,\" but wouldn't elaborate and would not say who the phone belonged to.",
      "Police are still going through surveillance images and said they have video, but no audio, of the shooting. A joint law enforcement task force said they were conducting a reverse video canvass. Investigators will look at footage from all cameras from the crime scene all cameras from the crime scene and in the surrounding areas to try to track the suspect's escape route.",
      "They are also looking to see where the suspect may have come from.",
      "Police released surveillance images showing the suspect minutes before the shooting at a Starbucks two blocks from the shooting. Police told CBS News they found unspecified \"forensic evidence\" at the Starbucks and that items recovered there are being tested for possible DNA and fingerprints by the NYPD's Crime Scene Unit.",
      "Investigators and security at UnitedHealthcare are combing through files searching for a possible motive, looking for possible previous threats, and disgruntled or recently fired workers, a law enforcement source said. The company said it is cooperating with the investigation. Police are also looking at social media and interviewing employees, family members and others who knew Thompson, Kenny said.",
      "Ongoing manhunt will not disrupt holiday events",
      "NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said that police will use all of the resources at their disposal, including drone and K-9 units, to find the suspect. People in Manhattan can expect to see a heavier-than-usual police presence in the borough, especially at Wednesday night's Christmas Tree Lighting at Rockefeller Center, Maddrey said.",

    "title": "Supreme Court seems likely to uphold Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for kids",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:07:41 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court weighed whether Tennessee's ban on gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria violates the Constitution.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared sympathetic to Tennessee's efforts to restrict access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, as the justices stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth.",
      "Twenty-four states have passed laws similar to Tennessee's, which prohibits puberty blockers or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18. The dispute brought by the Biden administration, three families and a doctor tests whether states cross a constitutional line when regulating medical care that transgender adolescents argue is crucial to their well-being.",
      "The court's conservative justices appeared likely to side with Tennessee in the case. Several cited \"evolving\" medical research as to the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for adolescents experiencing gender dysphoria. At numerous points during arguments, which ran more than two hours, several members of the conservative wing questioned whether determinations about policies with shifting scientific findings are for courts to decide, rather than best left to state lawmakers elected by the people.",
      "\"If the Constitution doesn't take sides, if there's strong, forceful, scientific policy arguments on both sides in a situation like this, why isn't it best to leave it to the democratic process?\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts noted recent studies by some health authorities in European countries that have warned of insufficient evidence on the efficacy of treatments for transgender youth. Following an independent review from the United Kingdom, England's National Health Service stopped prescribing puberty blockers and hormones to minors with gender dysphoria.",
      "\"We're not the best situated to address issues like that,\" Roberts said. \"Doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch, who authored a 2020 decision that extended protections from discrimination in the workplace to transgender and gay employees, did not ask any questions.",
      "U.S. v. Skrmetti",
      "The case before the Supreme Court, U.S. v. Skrmetti, involves a Tennessee law known as SB1 that was\u00a0adopted in 2023. It bars health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in prohibiting treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Tennessee's law is part of a wave of measures passed by GOP-led states in recent years prohibiting gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria. President-elect Donald Trump has also pledged to restrict medical treatments for transgender adolescents and prohibit transgender athletes from competing in women's sports, another area where states have enacted bans.",
      "During oral arguments, several of the court's conservative justices sounded skeptical of the federal government's assertion that Tennessee's ban should be struck down as unconstitutional because it discriminates based on sex. They also raised concerns about the evidence surrounding the efficacy of the treatments and questioned whether courts should second-guess state lawmakers on the issue.",
      "\"If it's evolving like that and changing, and England's pulling back and Sweden's pulling back, it strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come, the nine of us, and constitutionalize the whole area when the rest of the world, or at least the countries that have been at the forefront of this, are pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" Kavanaugh said.",
      "Roberts echoed that sentiment, saying the justices \"might think that we can do just as good a job with respect to the evidence here as Tennessee or anybody else, but my understanding is that the Constitution leaves that question to the people's representatives rather than to nine people, none of whom is a doctor.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito sparred with Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued on behalf of the Biden administration, over medical research on puberty blockers and hormone therapy, peppering her with questions about the findings of studies into the benefits and risks of gender-affirming care for minors.",
      "Kavanaugh, later joined by Justice Amy Coney Barrett, questioned the implications of a decision that would adopt the Biden administration's preferred standard of review that judges should apply when weighing the constitutionality of Tennessee's law and others like it.",
      "\"What would that mean for women's and girl's sports in particular?\" he asked Prelogar. \"Would transgender athletes have a constitutional right, as you see it, to play in women and girl's sports \u2014 basketball, swimming, volleyball, track, etc. \u2014 notwithstanding the competitive, fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes?\"",
      "The Biden administration has argued that the lower court applied the wrong standard when evaluating the constitutionality of Tennessee's law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit held that the ban is subject to rational-basis review, the most deferential of the three tiers of scrutiny. But Prelogar has argued the law should be subject to a more stringent level of judicial review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it classifies based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "If the Supreme Court agrees with the Biden administration, it could send the case back to the lower court to apply that more demanding standard, as Prelogar is asking it to do.",
      "The court's liberals highlighted the potentially dire consequences of gender dysphoria and the role of gender-affirming care in addressing them, and likened Tennessee's ban to state laws that discriminated on the basis of race in the past. They grilled the attorney appearing on behalf of the state, Tennessee Solicitor General J. Matthew Rice, with questions aimed at showing the state's law constitutes sex-based discrimination.",
      "\"The whole thing is imbued with sex. It's based on sex,\" Justice Elena Kagan told Rice. \"You might have reasons for thinking that it's an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them. But it's a dodge to say, this is not based on sex, it's based on medical purpose.\"",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor argued the \"evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment.\"",
      "Rice argued that the state is trying to protect young people from \"irreversible and life-altering consequences\" of these medical interventions and said the treatments are \"risky\" and \"unproven.\" The law, he told the Supreme Court, sets age- and use-based limits on medical care, and is a routine exercise of the state's authority to regulate medicine.",
      "\"Politically accountable lawmakers, not judges, are in the best position to assess this evolving medical issue,\" he said.",
      "But the Biden administration, along with the three Tennessee families and Memphis doctor, assert the state's ban draws sex-based lines and discriminates based on transgender status, a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Under Tennessee's law, an adolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can, Prelogar said. And an adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a female, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can, she told the court.",
      "Prelogar argued Tennessee's law \"categorically bans treatment when and only when it's inconsistent with the patient's birth sex.\"",
      "Shortly before Tennessee's law took effect, the families with transgender children and Dr. Susan Lacy, who provided gender-affirming care to patients diagnosed with gender dysphoria, challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status and is likely unconstitutional. The judge ruled that the \"benefits of the medical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established,\" and said the law bars treatments for \"a tiny fraction of minors, while leaving them available to all other minors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\"",
      "A divided panel of judges on the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued. The measure, the court found, regulates gender-affirming care for all minors, regardless of sex.",
      "\"Life-tenured federal judges should be wary of removing a vexing and novel topic of medical debate from the ebbs and flows of democracy by construing a largely unamendable Constitution to occupy the field,\" Chief Judge Jeffrey Sutton wrote.",
      "Both the Biden administration and the families, represented by the ACLU, separately asked the Supreme Court to review the 6th Circuit's decision. The high court in June agreed to do so, but took up only the Biden administration's appeal, which asked the justices to decide whether Tennessee's law violated the Equal Protection Clause. The parents had argued the law infringed on their due process right to make decisions about their children's medical care, but the justices are not considering that question.",
      "Barrett noted that regardless of how the Supreme Court rules, the parents could still pursue their parental-rights claim.",
      "Prelogar argued on behalf of the U.S. on Wednesday, and she shared time with Chase Strangio of the ACLU, who made history as the first openly transgender person to argue before the Supreme Court. Rice presented the state's case to the justices.",
      "The case is the most significant involving transgender rights that the Supreme Court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, has heard in years. In 2020, the high court divided 6-3 in finding that Title VII's protections from discrimination in the workplace extend to gay and transgender employees. Gorsuch authored the majority opinion, which Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal members joined.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court in this case is expected by the end of June.",

    "story": [
      "UNITY TOWNSHIP, Pa. (KDKA) - At least another full day of digging will be needed to find a woman who is believed to have been swallowed by a sinkhole behind a restaurant in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, state police said.",
      "\"Unless it's a miracle, most likely this is [a] recovery [effort],\" Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Stephen Limani said.",
      "At a 5 p.m. news conference Wednesday, state police said the rescue effort for 64-year-old Elizabeth Pollard has now shifted to a recovery effort.",
      "Police, firefighters, mining experts, and search and rescue teams have spent nearly two full days digging, shoring up and searching an abandoned coal mine behind Monday's Restaurant on Marguerite Road in Unity Township.",
      "State police said Pollard likely fell into a sinkhole, about the size of a manhole, behind the restaurant sometime between Monday evening and the early hours of Tuesday. She was looking for her cat at the time.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, state police said the mine had become unstable and it was no longer safe for search teams to enter and work in. Now, they plan to dig more of the area out.",
      "\"Because of the fragile state of the mine, we've had to change what we were trying to do,\" Limani said. \"We were trying to basically suction the removal of dirt and debris and rocks, and even using water to try and soften the debris up or even push it out of our way to [now] where we have to dig out a massive area, more than four times the size of the area that we had originally done, to try and secure the mine so we can access it to try and go in there and recover her.\"",
      "Ligonier Construction was called in to help with digging out the old mine.",
      "\"It's basically pieces of wood and a little bit of rock side walls and plywood, and it's been there for 75 years,\" Limani said. \"It's been at the same temperature, it's basically been encapsulated, and it's basically 55ish degrees and it's been that way for that long. Now we're introducing freezing cold water, different types of temperatures, you're creating a very rough environment for fragile material and that's some of the hurdles we've encountered.\"",
      "So far, state police said they do not have a location of where Pollard ended up after falling. They also have not heard any sounds or noises from the mine.",
      "However, Limani said they spotted a lone shoe for a second time in the dirt and mud.",
      "He said the space they are working in is as fragile as a \"house of cards.\"",
      "\"Now you've built that house and you're trying to operate inside that house to pull out boulders and move dirt and put high-powered water to break up clay and suck it out, all while you're around a deck of cards, that's about how fragile it is,\" he said.",
      "State police have informed Pollard's family that the operation is moving a recovery phase.",
      "\"It's just a matter of trying to find her and do right by her family,\" Limani said. \"We had a conversation with them a couple hours ago about where we thought the investigation was. I know we have a lot of hopes, and maybe there is still a glimmer of hope, but based off of oxygen levels being a little lower, even though we've pumped oxygen into the mine, it's lower than what you would want for someone to try and sustain their life. It's been difficult.\"",
      "Even crews working at the scene have had a hard time dealing with such a difficult and sensitive operation.",
      "\"You're risking the safety of yourself and you're risking the safety of others for the potential,\" Limani said. \"As we keep weighing out the risks and the potential just kept getting lower and lower and lower, it feels like a failure. I'm not going to lie. It feels like we've failed, but if somebody else gets hurt, I think it would be worse.\"",
      "Now that the operation has moved into a recovery phase, crews are wrapping up for the night and will return to the scene in the morning. State police emphasize though that no one is giving up. In the meantime, they are preparing to work during Thursday's inclement weather. Accumulating snow is in the forecast for western Pennsylvania.",
      "They are asking for continued support from people who are following their efforts.",
      "State police are also thanking the community on behalf of all the workers. Limani said the village of Westmoreland County where this is all taking place is very tightknit.",
      "People and restaurants from all over have been bringing food to keep the workers fed and warm.",
      "\"Keep rooting for us,\" he said.",
      "Abandoned mine declared \"unstable\"",

The efforts are ongoing today. I'd like to also address some rumors that have been going around. We've been made aware of some rumors, one being that Ms. Pollard has been found. That is false. We are still actively searching for Ms. Pollard. We are hopeful that she is found alive.\"",
      "In an update on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Greenfield along with Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department Chief John Bacha, provided details on how the search has continued and their efforts to find Pollard.",
      "\"We're still working on some cameras, some electronic devices, some canines, for various reasons, to go through and trying to locate Ms. Pollard,\" Chief Bacha said. \"At this point, the scope of the situation and the condition of the mines, it's beyond sending rescuers in.\"",
      "Bacha went on to say that the roof of the abandoned mine had collapsed in several places and it was unstable. He said that the Bureau of Mines provided them with hand-drawn maps from the 1940s to help them with their search.",
      "However, oxygen has become a concern.",
      "\"It's now a concern for Ms. Pollard, absolutely. It's oxygen deficient,\" he said. \"At the same time, we've had experts from various areas. Many times we would blow air into it. We have fans, fans are made for that - to blow air, fresh oxygen in. At the same time, that can also create another problem in a coal mine. It can actually pull methane back into an area where we didn't have methane. Right now we have no explosive gases.\"",

      "At one point, more than 100 people had responded to the scene\u00a0to assist in the massive search and rescue effort.",

      "Pleasant Unity Volunteer Fire Department Chief John Bacha said no carbon monoxide or explosive gases were detected in the atmosphere underground.",
      "Authorities said the temperature in the mine is warmer than the outside air, estimating it was around 50 degrees Tuesday afternoon, much warmer than freezing temperatures above ground.",

      "Seneng, 60, found a bat in her classroom in mid-October, her friend Laura Splotch told KFSN-TV. She tried to scoop it up and take it outside but it bit her, Splotch said.",
      "Seneng did not immediately have symptoms of rabies but she fell ill weeks later and was taken to the hospital, where she was put into a medically-induced coma and died days later, Splotch told the TV station.",
      "\"It's devastating to see her in that state, with all the machines hooked up and everything, it was pretty upsetting and scary,\" Splotch told KFSN.",
      "According to her Facebook profile, Seneng was an art teacher at Bryant Middle School in Dos Palos, California. The Dos Palos-Oro Loma Joint Unified School District, called Seneng \"a dedicated and compassionate educator.\"",
      "\"We were shocked to learn that Leah's passing was related to contracting rabies, most likely from being bitten by a bat and we are cooperating with the Merced County Department of Public Health on their investigation,\" the school district said in a statement. \"We live and work in a community known to have bats and other wildlife around school grounds, and we will continue to help educate our community regarding the dangers associated with coming into direct contact with any wild animal, including bats.\"",
      "Merced County confirmed the rabies exposure but, due to privacy laws, did not release the deceased's name. The California Department of Public Health confirmed that the victim died after contracting rabies.",
      "\"Bites from bats can be incredibly small and difficult to see or to detect. It is important to wash your hands and look for any open wounds after touching a wild animal, and to seek immediate medical care if bitten,\" CDPH Director Dr. Tom\u00e1s J. Arag\u00f3n said in a statement. \"It is always safest to leave wild animals alone. Do not approach, touch, or try to feed any animals that you don't know.\"",
      "At least two other people in North America have died of rabies after encountering a bat in recent weeks. Last month, health officials in Canada announced that a\u00a0child died from rabies after being exposed to a bat in their room. About a week before that, officials announced a\u00a0U.S. citizen died\u00a0from rabies after being exposed to a bat in western Minnesota in July.",
      "How is rabies spread and what are the symptoms?",
      "Rabies is a deadly viral infection that attacks the nervous system in humans and animals, causing brain and spinal cord inflammation. It is typically spread to humans through direct contact with the saliva of an infected animal through scratching or biting.",
      "Rabies is commonly found in bats, raccoons, foxes, skunks and some household pets. Without proper and prompt treatment after symptoms appear, rabies is nearly 100 percent fatal in both animals and humans, according to Haldimand and Norfolk Health Services, where the child was admitted.",
      "Treatment has proven to be nearly 100% effective at preventing the disease if someone is exposed, though it must start before symptoms appear.",
      "Bats pose a unique risk because their scratches can be hard to notice due to their small teeth, and bats cannot be vaccinated through provincial programs, health officials said.",
      "If bitten by an animal suspected of carrying the virus, health officials advise washing the wound thoroughly with soap and water for 15 minutes and immediately seeking medical attention.",
      "According to the CDC, the incubation period of rabies may last from weeks to months, depending on the location of exposure, severity of exposure and age.",
      "\"The first symptoms of rabies, called prodrome, maybe like the flu, including weakness, discomfort, fever, or headache. There also may be discomfort, prickling, or an itching sensation at the site of the bite. These symptoms may last for several days,\" the CDC says.",

    "summary": "Jared Isaacman is an entrepreneur and veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX.",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, a veteran private astronaut with strong ties to Elon Musk and his rocket company SpaceX, has been picked to serve as NASA's next administrator, President-elect Donald Trump  announced Wednesday.",
      "If confirmed, Isaacman, 41, would be the fifth NASA administrator with spaceflight experience, replacing former Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, who flew into orbit aboard the space shuttle Columbia in early 1986.",
      "\"I am delighted to nominate Jared Isaacman, an accomplished business leader, philanthropist, pilot, and astronaut, as Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,\" Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social. \"... Jared's passion for Space, astronaut experience, and dedication to pushing the boundaries of exploration, unlocking the mysteries of the universe, and advancing the new Space economy, make him ideally suited to lead NASA into a bold new Era.\"",
      "Isaacman founded the payment processing company later named Shift4 Payments while he was a high school student. He chartered the first purely commercial, all-civilian American \"space tourist\" mission \u2014 Inspiration4 \u2014 in February 2021, paying SpaceX an undisclosed amount to launch him and three other civilian flyers on a two-day, 23-hour flight.",
      "He flew to space again this past September, commanding the first of three planned SpaceX Polaris missions, logging nearly five days in space on a flight that took the crew farther from Earth than any astronauts have gone since the Apollo moon program. Isaacman also became the first private citizen to carry out a spacewalk.",
      "He is scheduled to lead another Polaris mission aboard a SpaceX capsule before leading the first crew to space aboard the California rocket builder's gargantuan Super Heavy-Starship rocket.",
      "Dates have not been announced for either of those missions, and it's not yet clear what impact Isaacman's selection to lead NASA will have on those flights, whether Isaacman still intends to fly aboard one or both or what sort of influence his friendship with Musk might have on NASA's future direction.",
      "But Isaacman, a skilled pilot who flies his own MiG-29 fighter jet, made it clear in a post following Trump's announcement that NASA can expect him to be a vocal space advocate who will help \"usher in an era where humanity becomes a true spacefaring civilization.\"",
      "\"With the support of President Trump, I can promise you this: We will never again lose our ability to journey to the stars and never settle for second place,\" Isaacman said. \"We will inspire children, yours and mine, to look up and dream of what is possible. Americans will walk on the moon and Mars and in doing so, we will make life better here on Earth.\"",
      "He said it would be the \"honor of a lifetime to serve in this role and to work alongside NASA's extraordinary team to realize our shared dreams of exploration and discovery.\"",
      "Jim Bridenstine, Nelson's predecessor at the helm of NASA, helped kickstart the agency's Artemis moon program during the first Trump administration.",
      "He said in a statement Wednesday that \"Jared's vision for pushing boundaries, paired with his proven track record of success in private industry, positions him as an ideal candidate to lead NASA into a bold new era of exploration and discovery. I urge the Senate to swiftly confirm him.\"",
      "The Isaacman announcement comes as NASA struggles to keep the Artemis program on track amid tight budgets and what the agency's own inspector general calls the \"unsustainable\" costs of NASA's Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket.",
      "SpaceX supporters argue the company's more powerful, fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship rocket is the obvious choice for deep space exploration, but the huge rocket is far from operational with just a half-dozen suborbital test flights to its credit.",
      "The SLS, on the other hand, is considered operational in that it completed an initial test flight in November 2022, sending an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon and back. But unlike the Super Heavy-Starship, the SLS is a throwaway, expendable booster expected to cost some $1.4 billion for each of its first four moon missions.",
      "NASA is currently gearing up to launch three NASA astronauts and a Canadian flyer on an SLS-Orion mission \u2014 Artemis 2 \u2014 late next year. But problems with the first Orion's heat shield and other issues threaten to push the Artemis 2 flight into 2026, years past initial expectations.",
      "It's not yet clear when the Artemis 3 mission, the first to carry astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole, might be feasible.",
      "But that flight will feature a lunar lander built by SpaceX, a variant of the company's Starship upper stage. SpaceX has carried out six test flights of the fully reusable Super Heavy-Starship to date, but has not yet put the Starship upper stage into orbit or brought it down for an intact landing.",
      "Given the company's rapid-fire test schedule, most observers believe SpaceX will get the Super Heavy-Starship working as planned in the near future, but scores of test flights will be required to demonstrate the safety and reliability required by NASA to put astronauts aboard.",
      "And the moon mission poses unique challenges.",
      "For the initial landing mission, multiple Super Heavy \"tanker\" flights will be required to refuel the moon lander in low-Earth orbit before it can be sent to the moon. Once in lunar orbit, it will await the arrival of the Artemis 3 crew, launched aboard an Orion capsule by an SLS rocket.",
      "After boarding the Starship lander, two astronauts would descend to the surface, carry out the mission's planned exploration, and then head back up to the orbiting Orion for the trip back to Earth.",

    "summary": "Amazon allegedly stopped its fastest delivery service to almost 50,000 Prime subscribers in two District of Columbia ZIP codes.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon secretly excluded two ZIP codes from its fastest delivery service while charging nearly 50,000 Prime members who live in the areas its full Prime subscription price, the District of Columbia's attorney general alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
      "Amazon violated consumer protection laws by stopping its quickest delivery service to the two historically lower-income neighborhoods, then misled customers about why their packages were arriving later than advertised when they complained, according to the suit filed in D.C. Superior Court.",
      "The world's biggest online retailer's paid subscription service, Amazon Prime, offers two-day delivery for millions of items, as well as next-day or same-day for many other products for $139 a year, or $14.99 a month.",
      "Amazon in June 2022 decided to stop using its fleet of branded trucks to make Prime deliveries to D.C. ZIP codes 20019 and 20020, servicing them instead with third-party delivery services like UPS and the U.S. Postal Service. The company knew the decision would result in significantly slower deliveries for the areas, but did not tell existing or prospective customers, the suit alleges.",
      "Amazon informed the attorney general's office that the change came as the result of safety concerns for its drivers, the attorney general said. Yet the company was legally obligated to disclose the change to customers.",
      "\"Amazon is charging tens of thousands of hard-working Ward 7 and 8 residents for an expedited delivery service it promises but does not provide. While Amazon has every right to make operational changes, it cannot covertly decide that a dollar in one ZIP code is worth less than a dollar in another,\" D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb stated in a news\u00a0release.\"We're suing to stop this deceptive conduct and make sure District residents get what they're paying for.\"",

      "Romney said \"the scourge of partisan politics\" has prevented efforts to stabilize the nation's debt, stressing that without the \"burden\" of the interest on the debt, the nation could spend three times as much military procurement, or twice as much on Social Security benefits every month.",
      "McConnell noted that observers might have wondered after Romney's governorship and bid for the presidency what more he had to prove as he came to the Senate.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:16:13 -0500",
    "summary": "The Israeli military said its aircraft struck senior Hamas militants involved in terrorist activities in the area.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli airstrikes tore through a tent camp for displaced Palestinians in southern Gaza on Wednesday, sparking fires and killing at least 21 people, according to the head of a nearby hospital, in the latest assault on a sprawling tent city that Israel designated a humanitarian safe zone but has repeatedly targeted. A spokesman for Gaza's civil defense agency said five children were killed in the strike.",
      "The Israeli military said it struck senior Hamas militants involved in terrorist activities in the area, without providing additional details, and said it took precautions to minimize harm to civilians.",
      "The strike on the Muwasi tent camp was one of several deadly assaults across the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. An Israeli attack in central Gaza killed at least 10 more people, including four children, according to Palestinian medics.",
      "Israel's devastating war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' October 2023 attack, shows no signs of ending after nearly 14 months. Hamas is still holding dozens of Israeli hostages, and most of Gaza's population has been displaced and is reliant on international food aid to survive. Israel is also pressing a major offensive in the isolated north, where experts say Palestinians might be experiencing famine.",
      "The Biden administration has pledged to make a new push for a Gaza ceasefire now that there's a truce in Lebanon between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah, ending more than a year of cross-border fighting. Meanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump demanded this week the release of hostages held by Hamas before he is sworn into office in January.",
      "Wednesday's strike in Muwasi \u2014 a desolate area with few public services that holds hundreds of thousands of displaced people \u2014 wounded at least 28 people, according to Atif al-Hout, the director of Nasser Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis.",
      "An Associated Press journalist at the hospital counted at least 15 bodies, but said reaching a precise number was difficult because many of the dead were dismembered and some were badly burned.",
      "\"It was like doomsday,\" said a wounded woman, Iman Jumaa, who held back tears as she described how the strike killed her father, her brothers and her brothers' children.",
      "Videos and photos of the strike shared widely on social media showed flames and a column of black smoke rising into the night sky, as well as twisted metal tent frames and shredded fabric. Palestinian men searched through the still-burning wreckage, shouting, \"Over here guys!\" Further away, civilians stood at a distance, observing the destruction.",
      "The military said the strikes had set off secondary blasts, indicating explosives present in the area had detonated. It was not possible to independently confirm the Israeli claims, and the strikes could also have ignited fuel, cooking gas canisters or other materials in the camp.",
      "Shortly after the strike, Al-Awda Hospital said two people had been killed and 38 wounded in an attack on a residential block in the Nuseirat refugee camp. The military had no immediate comment on the strike, but said earlier strikes in central Gaza had hit \"terrorist targets.\"",
      "Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians and blames Hamas for their deaths, saying the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.",
      "Previous Israeli strikes on tent camps in Gaza have drawn widespread international outrage, such as when a wounded student's last moments were caught on video as he burned to death in a tent outside a hospital.",
      "In northern Gaza, dozens of Palestinian families said Israel's expanding offensive had forcibly displaced them from schools-turned-shelters. Associated Press footage showed people on the road Wednesday leaving Beit Lahia, many crowded onto donkey carts with their belongings in their arms. Others walked on foot.",
      "\"This morning a quadcopter (drone) detonated four bombs at the school. There were people injured, human remains \u2014 we left with nothing,\" said Sadeia al-Rahel.",
      "The 57-year-old said her family has been eating grass, leaves, and animal feed for two months due to the lack of food aid in the north.",
      "The amount of aid entering Gaza plunged in October, and hunger is widespread across the territory, even in central Gaza where aid groups have more access. Humanitarian organizations say Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order make it difficult to deliver assistance. Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed over 44,500 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were combatants. The Israeli military says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.",
      "The Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and around 250 people were abducted. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel said its forces recovered the body of a hostage who was captured alive during the Oct. 7 attack. Israel believes Itay Svirsky was killed by his captors.",
      "The families of hostages held in Gaza have grown increasingly concerned that their loved ones are at risk so long as the war continues. Israel's military released on Wednesday the findings of a probe into the circumstances behind the deaths of six hostages whose bodies were recovered in August, determining they were probably shot by their captors after a nearby Israeli strike in February.",

    "title": "South Korean leader faces likely impeachment over martial law order",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:06:48 -0500",
    "summary": "South Korea is reeling over a shock martial law declaration by President Yoon Suk Yeol, whose short-lived gamble will have major implications.",
    "story": [
      "Seoul\u00a0\u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol seemed to treat a declaration of martial law as if it were a light switch, flipping it on at 11 p.m. Tuesday night, only to be unanimously rebuked in an emergency session of the country's parliament just two hours later. It took him about three hours from that point to accept defeat and announce that he was lifting the martial law order.",
      "The martial law declaration and revocation within six hours was the fiercest whiplash between military control and democracy that South Korea has endured since it became a democracy in 1987. It appears highly likely to bring a swift end to Yoon's two-year tenure as the country's elected leader.",
      "The president's gamble seemed rooted primarily in his own domestic political isolation and, while short-lived, it was sure to have major ramifications both for Yoon as a politician, and for South Korea as a nation.",
      "Below is a look at what Yoon did, why he did it, and what it could mean for one of Asia's most vibrant democracies and biggest economies.",
      "What is martial law?",
      "A declaration of martial law is typically used by political or military leaders in a country facing a purported immediate threat to stability or security. It is ostensibly intended to protect the rule of law and citizens by putting military forces in immediate control of a country, suspending the authority of a civilian government and legal system.",
      "Yoon's order immediately put South Korea's military in charge of security across the country, froze virtually all existing laws and granted the forces extraordinary powers to detain people without charge and to censor the media.",
      "There was no indication that South Korean troops took advantage of the powers granted to them during the six hours of martial law on Tuesday evening, though there were tense scuffles as forces blocked access to the parliament building and throngs of angry citizens turned up to protest Yoon's sudden move.",
      "Why did South Korea's president impose martial law?",
      "\"I declared martial law at 11:00 last night with a firm will to save the country against anti-state forces that are trying to paralyze the essential functions of the state and destroy the constitutional order of liberal democracy,\" Yoon told his nation in a televised address, claiming the declaration would protect south Korea from a \"threat of the North Korean communist forces.\"",
      "But he never identified any specific military movements by the North, and his shock move appeared to have been directed more at what he called the \"legislative dictatorship\" of his own country's opposition Democratic Party.",
      "Yoon has seen his approval rating fall for several months, and with the opposition in control of the parliament for the last two years, he's struggled to move forward any of his political objectives. He's also faced criticism for dismissing multiple calls for independent investigations into financial scandals involving himself and his wife.",
      "He complained Tuesday that the opposition had effectively left him unable to govern, including by proposing nearly two dozen impeachment motions against his conservative government and slashing his national budget by at least $700 billion dollars.",
      "But despite Yoon's political isolation and falling support among voters, few in the country anticipated a counterattack as dramatic as the declaration of martial law.",
      "What will the martial law declaration mean for South Korea?",
      "In an early indication of the huge impact of Yoon's move, South Korea's Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun offered his resignation Wednesday, expressing regret \"for causing confusion and concern to the public regarding martial law.\"",
      "In a statement from his office, Kim said he took \"full responsibility for all matters related to martial law,\" excusing rank and file troops who he said had merely \"performed their duties\" under his orders.",
      "\"Martial law has been lifted and the public is returning to their daily lives, but the domestic political and security situations are not easy,\" Kim said in the statement, adding that the ministry would \"make every effort to manage current issues stably while ensuring that there are no disruptions in national defense operations.\"",
      "The White House, in a statement late Tuesday in Washington, expressed relief that Yoon had rescinded his martial law declaration.",
      "\"Democracy is at the foundation of the U.S.-ROK alliance, and we will continue to monitor the situation,\" an administration spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by the initials of its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "\"Whichever way this shakes out, this is a major setback for what has been seen as a democratic stronghold in the Asia Pacific for the last 44 years,\" said CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former senior Homeland Security official.",
      "\"The overall perception of South Korea as a stable democracy has been tarnished at a time when an aggressive China and overall retrenchment from democracy globally are big concerns for U.S. national security,\" said Vinograd, who's now the geopolitical lead at the Brunswick Group think tank in Washington.",
      "Washington has a deeply vested interest in stability in South Korea. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in the country, largely to deter any aggression by nuclear-armed North Korea, but also as a deterrent against an increasingly assertive China.",
      "South Korea's capital Seoul lies just 30 miles south of the Demilitarized Zone \u2014 the no-man's land created to separate the North and South when an armistice ended combat in the Korean War in 1953. The two countries technically remain at war as there was never a formal treaty, and tension between the Koreas has escalated in recent years, including under Yoon, who's taken a harder line on the North than his predecessor.",
      "\"The Biden administration is going to be faced with some very difficult decisions about what to say and do,\" said Vinograd. \"South Korea is one of our closest allies, but this move seems to have come as a surprise to the White House.\"",
      "\"South Korea is a strong balancing factor against North Korea and against communist China,\" Vinograd said, adding that both the North and Moscow \"are likely cheering the democratic upheaval in South Korea.\"",
      "\"They see any signs of instability in South Korea as something that they can take advantage of,\" she said. \"Without a vibrant democracy in South Korea, forces within China, within North Korea, will likely feel emboldened, and overall, democratic tendencies in the Asia Pacific will likely take a hit as well.\"",
      "Yoon faces calls to resign, threat of impeachment",
      "Yoon looked increasingly likely to lose his job Wednesday after his seemingly dramatic miscalculation of political support.",
      "The Democratic Party called quickly for Yoon to step down or face impeachment, and along with five smaller opposition parties, it submitted a bill in parliament Wednesday to impeach the president, with voting expected on the measure Friday or Saturday.",
      "\"It was clearly revealed to the entire nation that President Yoon could no longer run the country normally. He should step down,\" senior Democratic Party lawmaker Park Chan-dae said in a statement, urging Yoon not to wait to be forced out.",
      "South Korea's parliament, the National Assembly, can impeach the president if over two-thirds of lawmakers vote in favor of the move. If it happens and he doesn't resign first, South Korea's constitutional court will then hold a trial to either confirm or deny the impeachment motion. Six of the nine justices on the court must back an impeachment for it to go ahead.",
      "Yoon's PPP holds 108 seats in the 300-member legislature, but even his own party appeared unlikely to back the embattled president too robustly. Its leader called Wednesday for Yoon's entire cabinet to resign, and the unanimous vote overruling his martial law declaration was a clear indication of the level of opposition to his conduct.",
      "South Korean stocks tumble after martial law declaration",
      "The streets of Seoul appeared largely normal Wednesday despite the overnight tumult. While police were out in force amid renewed protests against Yoon around the parliament, the usual morning rush hour traffic choked roads and railways.",
      "More protests were expected, however, and South Korea's biggest labor union coaltion, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, declared a nationwide strike and said it would hold a rally in the capital until Yoon left office.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Seoul urged American nationals in the city to avoid areas where protests were taking place, and some of the country's biggest employers, including the LG Electronics brand, urged employees to work from home.",
      "The unrest also took a toll on Asian stocks, with South Korean shares falling about 1.4% Wednesday and the country's currency, the won, stable but still close to a two-year low against the dollar.",
      "South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and national bank governor Rhee Chang-yong gathered their deputies overnight for emergency meetings, and the finance ministry promised to take whatever measures were necessary to prop up falling share prices, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Reuters said canned goods and staples such as instant noodles and bottled water flew off store shelves overnight as South Koreans feared a possible lingering political crisis.",
      "\"South Korea is no stranger to martial law,\" Vinograd told CBS News, noting that the measure had been declared at least 15 times by various authoritarian regimes since the country's founding in 1948.",
      "\"I'm deeply disturbed by this kind of situation,\" Seoul resident Kim Byeong-In, 39, told Reuters overnight, \"and I'm very concerned about the future of the country.\"",

Yet Barnier's proposed austerity budget \u2014 slashing 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raising taxes by 20 billion euros \u2014 has only deepened divisions, inflaming tensions in the lower house and triggering this dramatic political confrontation.",
      "Barnier on Monday invoked a rarely used constitutional mechanism to push through the contentious 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, arguing it was essential to maintain \"stability\" amid deep political divisions.",
      "The use of the constitutional tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier's concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. The far-right leader Marine Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party's demands.",
      "\"Everyone must shoulder their responsibilities,\" she said.",

    "summary": "China put \"lives at risk\" with the \"unlawful use of water cannons\" against Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, the U.S. ambassador in Manila says.",
    "story": [
      "Manila, Philippines\u00a0\u2014 Chinese coast guard vessels backed by navy ships fired powerful water cannons and blocked and sideswiped a Philippine patrol vessel on Wednesday in renewed aggression at a disputed shoal in the South China Sea, Philippine officials said.",
      "U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines, MaryKay Carlson, condemned China's \"unlawful use of water cannons and dangerous maneuvers,\" accusing Beijing in a social media post of putting \"lives at risk\" by disrupting a Philippine maritime operation.",
      "\"We condemn these actions and stand with our like-minded friends, partners, allies in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific,\" Carlson said.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea as its territory, but that claim overlaps with the territorial waters, exclusive economic zones and high seas claims of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan. Indonesia has also had confrontations with the Chinese coast guard, which backs Beijing's fishing fleets.",
      "The long-simmering territorial disputes between China and America's allies and other Asian nations are a delicate fault line in the regional rivalry between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. lays no claims in the South China Sea, which is a key global shipping route, but has declared that freedom of navigation and overflight, and the peaceful resolution of the conflicts, are among its core national interests.",
      "The U.S. has warned that it's obligated to defend the Philippines, a treaty ally, if Filipino forces come under attack in the South China Sea.",
      "China and Philippines accuse each other of aggression at sea",
      "Three Philippine coast guard and bureau of fisheries vessels were on routine patrol to protect Filipino fishermen at Scarborough Shoal when several Chinese coast guard and navy ships approached and staged \"aggressive actions\" after dawn, the Philippine coast guard said.",
      "Liu Dejun, a spokesperson for China's Coast Guard, said four Philippine ships had \"dangerously approached\" the coast guard's \"normal law enforcement patrol vessels,\" forcing the Chinese forces to \"exercise control\" around the Scarborough Shoal, which China claims as its territory and calls Huangyan Island.",
      "Liu said one of the Philippine craft ignored warnings, making maneuvers that \"seriously threatened\" the safety of a coast guard vessel.",
      "\"We warn the Philippines to immediately stop infringement, provocation and propaganda, otherwise it will be responsible for all consequences,\" he said.",
      "China has increasingly accused the Philippines and other Asian neighbors of violating its sovereignty in contested offshore regions. It has vowed to defend what Beijing considers its territory, despite a 2016 international arbitration decision that invalidated China's historical claims to the waters around Scarborough Shaol.",
      "Despite the Chinese ships' \"reckless\" maneuvers, the Philippine coast guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resource said they renewed their \"commitment to protecting the rights and safety of our fishermen within our maritime jurisdiction.\"",
      "\"We will continue to be vigilant in safeguarding our national interests in the West Philippine Sea,\" the two Philippine law enforcement agencies said, using the Philippine name for the seas off the archipelago's western coast.",

      "Since then, each week has brought a grim litany of shootouts, abductions, bodies dumped in the street and vehicles and businesses set alight, sending Culiacan's 800,000 residents scrambling for cover.",
      "The bloodletting began on September 9 after details emerged of how the son of the cartel's jailed founder Joaquin \"El Chapo\" Guzman reportedly double-crossed the cartel's other co-founder, Ismael \"El Mayo\" Zambada.",
      "Zambada was arrested on U.S. soil on July 25 after allegedly being kidnapped in Mexico and delivered to U.S. authorities against his will.",

Bodies have appeared across the city, often left slung out on the streets or in cars with either sombreros on their heads or pizza slices or boxes pegged onto them with knives. The pizzas and sombreros have become informal symbols for the warring cartel factions, underscoring the brutality of their warfare.",

      "The operation ended in humiliation for the government, which was forced to free the drug lord after the cartel launched a massive assault on the city.",
      "While Culiacan recovered quickly from that episode -- and Ovidio was later recaptured -- the succession war now raging within the cartel has brought the local economy to the brink of collapse.",

    "summary": "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to resign immediately or face impeachment.",
    "story": [
      "South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's government early Wednesday lifted the martial law he imposed during a tense night of political drama in which troops surrounded parliament and lawmakers voted to reject military rule.",
      "Yoon said his government withdrew military personnel following a bipartisan parliamentary vote that rejected martial law, and the measure was formally lifted around 4:30 a.m. during a Cabinet meeting. In all, martial law was in effect for about six hours.",
      "South Korea's main opposition party on Wednesday urged Yoon to resign immediately or face impeachment. Yoon has not publicly responded to the opposition's demand. But his office said senior presidential advisers and secretaries for Yoon offered to resign collectively and the president also put off his official Wednesday morning schedule.",
      "In the capital, tourists and residents walked around, traffic and construction were heard, and other than crowds of police holding shields, it seemed like a normal sunny, cold December morning.",
      "The liberal opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the 300-seat parliament, said Wednesday that its lawmakers decided to call on Yoon to quit immediately or they would take steps to impeach him.",
      "\"President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration was a clear violation of the constitution. It didn't abide by any requirements to declare it,\" the Democratic Party said in a statement. \"His martial law declaration was originally invalid and a grave violation of the constitution. It was a grave act of rebellion and provides perfect grounds for his impeachment.\"",
      "Impeaching him would require support from two-thirds of the parliament, or 200 of its 300 members. The Democratic Party and other small opposition parties together have 192 seats.",
      "Why was martial law declared in South Korea?",
      "Late Tuesday, Yoon imposed martial law out of frustration with the opposition, vowing to eliminate \"anti-state\" forces as he struggles against opponents who control the country's parliament and who he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea.",
      "Yoon said during a televised speech that martial law would help \"rebuild and protect\" the country from \"falling into the depths of national ruin.\" He said he would \"eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.\"",
      "\"I will eliminate anti-state forces as quickly as possible and normalize the country,\" he said, while asking the people to believe in him and tolerate \"some inconveniences.\"",
      "Under South Korea's constitution, the president can declare martial law during \"wartime, war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states\" that require the use of military force to maintain peace and order. It was questionable whether South Korea is currently in such a state.",
      "When martial law is declared, \"special measures\" can be employed to restrict the freedom of press, freedom of assembly and other rights, as well as the power of courts.",
      "The constitution also states that the president must oblige when the National Assembly demands the lifting of martial law with a majority vote.",
      "Hours later, parliament voted to lift the declaration, with National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik declaring that lawmakers \"will protect democracy with the people.\" The resolution was passed with 190 of 300 members of the ruling and opposition parties in attendance, with all present in favor, the BBC\u00a0reported.",
      "Police and military personnel were seen leaving the Assembly's grounds after Woo called for their withdrawal. Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal Democratic Party, which holds the majority in the 300-seat parliament, said the party's lawmakers would remain in the Assembly's main hall until Yoon formally lifted his order.",
      "\"Democratic Party lawmakers, including me and many others, will protect our country's democracy and future and public safety, lives and properties, with our own lives,\" Lee told reporters.",
      "While announcing his plan to lift martial law, Yoon continued to criticize parliament's attempts to impeach key government officials and senior prosecutors. He said lawmakers had engaged in \"unscrupulous acts of legislative and budgetary manipulation that are paralyzing the functions of the state.\"",
      "Seemingly hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the Assembly, waving banners and calling for Yoon's impeachment. Some protesters scuffled with troops ahead of the lawmakers' vote, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major property damage. At least one window was broken as troops attempted to enter the Assembly building. One woman tried unsuccessfully to pull a rifle away from one of the soldiers, while shouting \"Aren't you embarrassed!\"",
      "The president's surprising move harkened back to an era of authoritarian leaders that the country has not seen since the 1980s, and it was immediately denounced by the opposition and the leader of Yoon's own conservative party.",
      "Following Yoon's announcement, South Korea's military proclaimed that parliament and other political gatherings that could cause \"social confusion\" would be suspended, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.",
      "The military also said that the country's striking doctors should return to work within 48 hours, Yonhap said. Thousands of doctors have been striking for months over government plans to expand the number of students at medical schools. The military said anyone who violates the decree could be arrested without a warrant.",
      "Soon after the declaration, the National Assembly speaker called in an emergency statement released on his YouTube channel for all lawmakers to gather at the National Assembly, where the opposition Democratic Party holds a majority. He urged military and law enforcement personnel to \"remain calm and hold their positions.\"",
      "All 190 lawmakers who participated in the vote supported the lifting of martial law. Television footage showed soldiers who had been stationed at parliament leaving the site after the vote.",
      "Hours earlier, TV footage showed police officers blocking the entrance of the National Assembly and helmeted soldiers carrying rifles in front of the building to restrict entrance to the building. Dozens of police patrol cars and riot police buses were assembled, the BBC reported.",
      "\"Open the gate, please. Your job is to protect the National Assembly. Why are you standing idly by while MPs are being trampled?\" a middle-aged man shouted at a group of policemen guarding the gate.",
      "An Associated Press photographer saw at least three helicopters, likely from the military, that landed inside the Assembly grounds, while two or three helicopters circled above the site.",
      "The leader of Yoon's conservative People Power Party, Han Dong-hoon, called the decision to impose martial law \"wrong\" and vowed to \"stop it with the people.\" Lee, the opposition leader who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, called Yoon's announcement \"illegal and unconstitutional.\"",
      "A White House National Security Council spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration wasn't notified of the martial law declaration in advance but it was in contact with the South Korean government and \"is monitoring the situation closely.\"",
      "\"We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,\" the spokesperson said, referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that President Biden, who is traveling in Angola, has been briefed on the situation.",
      "Washington stations about 28,500 troops in South Korea to protect it from North Korea, its nuclear-armed neighbor. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said there was no effect on the U.S. service members based in South Korea.",
      "\"We are watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,\" U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said. \"We have every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.\"",
      "Yoon \u2014 whose approval rating has dipped in recent months \u2014 has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022.",
      "Yoon's party has been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition over next year's budget bill. The opposition has also attempted to pass motions to impeach three top prosecutors, including the chief of the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office, in what the conservatives have called a vendetta against their criminal investigations of Lee, who has been seen as the favorite for the next presidential election in 2027 in opinion polls.",
      "Yoon has also dismissed calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.",
      "Yoon's move is the first declaration of martial law since the country's democratization in 1987. The country's last previous martial law was in October 1979.",

      "A Chinese national living in California has been arrested and charged by federal law enforcement after he allegedly bought and exported guns and ammunition to North Korea at the direction of North Korean agents who funneled him $2 million to purchase the equipment, according to a newly unsealed criminal complaint.",
      "Shenghua Wen, 41, also admitted to trying to obtain military uniforms in an apparent attempt to help North Korean soldiers disguise themselves and conduct a \"surprise attack\" against South Korea, prosecutors said in an affidavit accompanying the complaint, which was filed on Nov. 26.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Wen came to the U.S. on a student visa in 2012 and lives in Ontario, California. During a series of interviews earlier this year, he allegedly told investigators that he met with North Korean officials in China before coming to the U.S., and they directed him to procure firearms, ammunition and technology on behalf of Pyongyang.",
      "Wen told the FBI he was \"good at smuggling,\" court records said, and he allegedly admitted he shipped two containers of guns in 2023 from Long Beach, California, to Hong Kong, where they were then smuggled into North Korea.",
      "Wen is charged with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on North Korea, which make it illegal to send American money or goods to the country without permission. An attorney for Wen could not immediately be identified.",
      "The affidavit filed in federal court in California revealed that FBI agents recovered 50,000 rounds of ammunition from Wen's car, and he allegedly admitted to having bought the ammo at the direction of North Korean officials. Law enforcement also seized a device used to detect chemical threats and a tool that can detect hidden surveillance devices, according to the affidavit. Investigators said they found photos of firearms and equipment that Wen sent in messages with co-conspirators, some of which they included in the affidavit.",
      "The criminal complaint did not detail the complete extent to which Wen allegedly worked on behalf of North Korea's government, but prosecutors wrote he communicated with his handlers via encrypted messaging apps where the officials directed his conduct and coordinated the smuggling operations.",
      "Wen allegedly bought some of the weapons he sent to North Korea via third-party straw purchasers and told investigators he drove on numerous occasions to Texas to obtain the firearms. To fund the allegedly illegal purchases and international shipments, Wen told authorities the North Korean government funneled about $2 million through a Chinese Bank into bank accounts belonging to Wen's partner, the criminal complaint said.",
      "\"During the interview on September 6, 2024, [Wen] explained that he believed the North Korean government wanted the weapons, ammunition, and other military-related equipment to prepare for an attack against South Korea,\" prosecutors wrote, adding his cellphone also contained numerous photos of U.S. military uniforms, pointing to his intent to ship the uniforms overseas.",
      "The Justice Department has charged other individuals living in the U.S. with similar conduct tied to the North Korean government. In May, federal prosecutors accused an Arizona woman of carrying out a scheme to help North Korean IT workers illegally obtain remote employment with American companies. The group allegedly used the identities of more than 60 individuals who lived in the U.S. to generate nearly $7 million for the North Korean government from more than 300 U.S. companies.",

      "Israel's military carried out a string of airstrikes late Monday against what it said were Hezbollah fighters, infrastructure and rocket launchers across Lebanon. The strikes were a response to Hezbollah firing two projectiles toward Mount Dov \u2014 a disputed Israeli-held territory known as Shebaa Farms in Lebanon where the borders of Lebanon, Syria, and Israel meet. Israel said the projectiles fell in open areas and no injuries were reported.",
      "Hezbollah said in a statement that it fired on an Israeli military position in the area as a \"defensive and warning response\" after what it called \"repeated violations\" of the ceasefire deal by Israel.

      "It was not immediately clear whether Trump was threatening to directly involve the U.S. military in Israel's war in Gaza. The U.S. has given Israel crucial military and diplomatic support throughout the nearly 15-month conflict.",
      "In a post on his Truth Social site, Trump called for Palestinian militants to free all of the roughly 100 Israeli hostages still held inside Gaza, about two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "If not, Trump said, \"Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America. RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!\"",
      "Hours earlier, the Israeli government confirmed the death of Omer Neutra, a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen, whose body is still believed to be held by Hamas in Gaza, according to the Israeli government.",
      "Trump issued his warning days after Hamas released a propaganda\u00a0video of American-Israeli hostage Edan Alexander, speaking under duress, urging the president-elect to negotiate to free the hostages.",
      "The Biden administration is mounting a last-ditch effort to try to restart talks between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined to comment on Trump's post, though President Isaac Herzog welcomed it.",
      "Netanyahu has faced regular protests against his government's handling of the hostage crisis, including by many who feel he has deliberately prolonged the war in Gaza to avoid facing his own looming corruption trial.",
      "\"We are all slaves of his private interests,\" asserted protester Tammy Barkan at a solemn silent demonstration over the weekend.",
      "\"I think the Israeli government doesn't want to\u2026 have this deal,\" agreed her fellow protester Meital Grimland.",
      "Netanyahu and his government have vowed to continue the military assault in Gaza until Hamas is completely dismantled and all the hostages, dead and alive, are brought back home.",
      "Warnings of famine in north Gaza as aid deliveries dwindle",
      "In Gaza, meanwhile, alarm is mounting over increasing hunger. The amount of food allowed in by Israel has plunged over the past two months, compounded by a decision Sunday by the United Nations to halt aid deliveries from the main crossing into the territory because of the threat of armed gangs looting convoys.",
      "The desperation and hunger have brought even more casualties, with medical officials saying on Friday that two girls, aged 13 and 17, and a 50-year-old woman were crushed to death as a crowd pushed to get bread at a bakery in the central Gaza Strip.",
      "Experts have already warned of famine in the northernmost part of Gaza, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October, saying they're fighting regrouped Hamas militants there.",
      "Displaced families have set up tents surrounded by piles of garbage on the streets of Gaza City. Bilal Marouf, 55, said he and 11 family members fled the Israeli offensive \"barefoot and naked.\"",
      "\"We had nothing. Hunger and thirst killed us, and we did not have a single shekel, nor clothes, nor a mattress, nor a blanket,\" he said, speaking near his tent.",
      "Israel's campaign in Gaza, triggered by Hamas' Oct 7, 2023 terrorist attack that saw the militants kill some 1,200 people across southern Israel and take 250 others hostage, has driven almost the entire population of the territory from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians now live in squalid tent camps, relying on international aid.",
      "The Israeli military said it allowed 40 trucks carrying 600 tons of flour for the World Food Program to enter the southern Gaza Strip on Sunday night, as well as 16 other food trucks.",
      "Israel has said it is working to increase the flow of aid. November saw an increase in the average number of humanitarian trucks it let into Gaza, up to 77 daily from 57 the month before, according to official Israeli figures. But the levels are still nearly the lowest of the entire 15-month war. And the U.N. says less than half of that actually reaches Palestinians because Israeli military restrictions, fighting and robberies make it too dangerous to deliver the aid.",
      "The World Food Program was able to only deliver aid to some 300,000 Palestinians in November across the Gaza Strip due to ongoing Israeli military offensives and the looting of convoys, Carl Skau, WFP's deputy executive director, said Monday.",
      "In a tent camp in the central Gaza town of Deir al-Balah, Palestinians lined up at makeshift mud ovens trying to buy a few loaves of flatbread for their families.",
      "With the price of flour mounting because of scarcity, the bakers \u2014 women displaced from further north \u2014 said they could bake less bread, and families could afford far less.",
      "\"They divide them to their children, one loaf every day,\" said one woman baker, Wafaa al-Attar.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump said late Monday that he will travel to Paris for the reopening of Notre Dame Cathedral, a grand celebration set to take place this weekend.",
      "\"It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,\" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. \"President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!\"",
      "Notre Dame was damaged in a fire that raged for 12 hours on April 15, 2019, nearly destroying the iconic 1,200-year-old church. Although experts said at the time that the restoration could take up to 40 years, Macron vowed to rebuild in five years.",
      "\"The decision to rebuild Notre Dame was about our capacity to save, restore, sometimes reinvent what we are by preserving where we come from,\" Macron told 60 Minutes. \"This is a message of achievement.\"",
      "Paris has been preparing for the reopening of the cathedral, which will be marked by days of celebration starting on Saturday. Laurent Ulrich, the Archbishop of Paris, along with Macron, will preside over Saturday's service, which will be broadcast on French television. Nearly 170 bishops from France and around the world are expected to participate in the celebration, along with one priest from each of the 106 parishes in the Diocese of Paris, and one priest from each of the seven Eastern Catholic Churches, accompanied by Catholics from these communities, according to Notre Dame's website.",
      "The inaugural mass, with the consecration of the high altar, will be on Sunday.",
      "Trump was in the White House for his first term when the fire occurred, and tweeted at the time that it was \"So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\"",
      "Macron, who has led France since 2017, was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump for winning the 2024 presidential election \u2014 posting on social media before Trump was projected the winner. During Trump's first term, the media had labeled their relationship a \"bromance,\" although there are likely to be fractures in the second Trump administration amid differences of opinion on NATO and Ukraine.",
      "This is the first international trip for Trump since he won the election last month. He visited France four times during his first term, and Melania Trump, who is Catholic, prayed at Notre Dame in 2017, before the fire.",

      "A hoard of Roman coins worth over $125,000 was found during a construction project in central England.",
      "The stash of gold and silver coins date back to the reign of Rome's Emperor Nero, according to Museums Worcestershire, which is raising funds to bid on the coins and keep them in the county where they were found. The stash of 1,368 coins, known as the Worcestershire Conquest Hoard, was buried in a pot and unearthed by members of the public in late 2023, according to the museum.",
      "\"The Hoard is one of the most important archaeological discoveries in Worcestershire in the last 100 years,\" the museum said.",
      "Most of the coins are silver denarii, according to the museum, and a single gold coin was minted for a British tribe local to the area at the time of its creation. The pot itself was likely made at a pottery kiln in the region, the museum said. The coins \"almost certainly\" were brought to the area by Roman soldiers, with one theory shared by the museum suggesting that the coins may have belonged to a wealthy local farmer who made his money supplying the army with grain and livestock.",
      "\"The hoard was assembled and buried during a brief moment in time when Worcestershire lay right at the edge of an expanding Empire,\" the museum said.",
      "Dr. Murray Andrews, a lecturer in British archaeology at the University College London, told CBS partner BBC News that the discovery was \"remarkable.\"",
      "\"It's the most miraculous thing I've seen over the last 100 years,\" he said. \"It's an important piece of archaeology. It tells us about what was happening here 2000 years ago, when the Malvern hills were maybe the boundary of the Roman Empire.\"",
      "This is the third hoard of coins to be found in the area in the past 25 years, according to the BBC. In 2011, two metal detectorists found a clay pot full of 3,784 coins, the BBC said, and in 1999, 434 silver coins and 38 pottery fragments were discovered.",
      "If Museums Worcestershire cannot raise the necessary funds, the latest hoard will be returned to the finders or the landowner, and may never go on public display, according to the BBC.",
      "\"What a fantastic find and so important for anyone wishing to understand more about the county's heritage,\" said Chair of the Joint Museums Committee Karen May in a news release. \"This is real Worcestershire treasure, and it needs to be seen and enjoyed by Worcestershire residents for generations to come.\"",

      "Lan's lawyer told AFP on Tuesday that in any case, it would likely be years before Lan faces execution, which is carried out by lethal injection in Vietnam.",

      "\"Every medical treatment has a risk, even taking aspirin,\" Sotomayor said. \"There's always going to be a percentage of the population under any medical treatment that's going to suffer a harm.

      "Sotomayor's comments came after Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice defended his state\u2019s ban on transgender medical procedures for minors, which is the first time a case involving transgender procedures has been brought before the high court. Rice argued that countries like Sweden, Finland and the U.K. have limited such interventions due to reported irreversible consequences.",

      "\"They cannot eliminate the risk of detransitioners,\" Rice said. \"So, it becomes a pure exercise of weighing benefit versus risk. And the question of how many minors have to have their bodies irreparably harmed for unproven benefits is one that is best left to the legislature.\"",
      "The high-profile case, United States v. Skrmetti, centers on a Tennessee law that bans gender-transition treatments for adolescents in the state. The law also takes aim at health care providers in Tennessee who continue to provide gender-transition treatments to transgender minors, opening them up to fines, lawsuits and other liability.",
      "The three justices appointed by former President Trump could play a key role in the outcome. Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett pressed both sides with tough questions, while Justice Neil Gorsuch remained silent throughout the lengthy hearing. A ruling is expected by July 2025.",

      "Detransitioner and Do Not Harm patient advocate Chloe Cole joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the Supreme Court case on gender transition for kids.",
      "The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a high-profile case regarding whether states can ban minors from receiving gender transition medical care under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, a closely-watched case that could impact the care and treatment for young people in at least half of U.S. states.",
      "Conservative justices on the Supreme Court appeared reluctant during Wednesday's oral arguments to overturn Senate Bill 1, the Tennessee law in question, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggesting that state legislatures, rather than courts, are best equipped to regulate medical procedures. The Constitution leaves such questions \"to the people's representatives,\" Roberts noted Wednesday, rather than to nine justices on the Supreme Court, \"none of whom is a doctor.\"",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, for his part, cited \"overwhelming evidence\" from certain medical studies listing the negative consequences from adolescents that underwent gender transition treatments. Should the justices rule along party lines to uphold the lower court's decision, it will have sweeping implications for more than 20 U.S. states that have moved to implement similar laws.",
      "The case in question, United States v. Skrmetti, centers on a Tennessee law that bans gender-transition treatments for minors in the state. The law, passed in March 2023, also takes aim at health care providers in Tennessee who continue to provide gender-transition treatments to transgender minors, opening them up to fines, lawsuits and other liability.",

      "A student leads a group of demonstrators in Knoxville, Tennessee, in protest of the state\u2019s 2022 transgender athlete ban. (Saul Young/Knoxville News-Sentinel /USA Today)",
      "At issue in the case is whether Tennessee's Senate Bill 1, which \"prohibits all medical treatments intended to allow 'a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex' or to treat 'purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor's sex and asserted identity,'\" violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",
      "Wednesday's oral arguments marked the first time the Supreme Court considered restrictions on puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgery for minors. However, it also comes as many other states have moved to ban or restrict medical treatments and procedures for transgender adolescents, placing outsize focus on the case and on oral arguments Wednesday, as observers closely watched the back-and-forth for clues as to how the court might rule.",
      "Petitioners in the case were represented by the Biden administration and the ACLU, which sued to overturn the Tennessee law on behalf of the parents of three transgender adolescents and a Memphis-based doctor.",
      "At issue during Wednesday's oral arguments was the level of scrutiny that courts should use to evaluate the constitutionality of state bans on transgender medical treatment for minors, such as SB1, and whether these laws are considered discriminating on the basis of sex or against a \"quasi-suspect class,\" thus warranting a higher level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.",
      "Both sides continued to battle over the level of scrutiny that the court should apply in reviewing laws involving transgender care for minors, including SB1.",
      "Petitioners argued that the court should use the test of heightened scrutiny, which requires states to identify an important objective that the law helps accomplish, while the state of Tennessee reiterated its claim that the rational basis test, or the most deferential test that was applied by the 6th Circuit Court in reviewing SB1, is sufficient.",
      "Petitioners, represented by U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, argued that SB1 discriminates against individuals on the basis of sex, which itself warrants a heightened level of scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. They argued that SB1 \"categorically bans treatment when, and only when, it\u2019s consistent with the patient\u2019s birth sex.\"",
      "In Tennessee, petitioners argued, the way that the sex-based classification works is that, \"from the standpoint of any individual who wants to take these medications, their sex determines whether SB1 applies.\"",
      "Prelogar cited one of the unnamed petitioners in the case, whom she referred to only as John Doe. Doe \"wants to take puberty blockers to undergo a typical male puberty. But SB1 says that because John sex at birth was female, he can't have access to those medications,\" Prelogar argued. \"And if you change his sex, then the restriction under SB1 lifts, and it changes the result.\"",
      "Petitioners also sought to assuage concerns raised by justices about the ability of states to pass legislation protecting minors, so long as the test meets a higher standard of scrutiny.",
      "Pressed by Justice Brett Kavanaugh on the impact the ruling could have on other states, Prelogar responded by noting that the court could write a very narrow opinion that states only that when a law prohibits conduct that is \"inconsistent with sex, that is a sex baseline, so you do have to apply heightened scrutiny.\"",
      "\"But the court has made clear that that's an intermediate standard,\" Prelogar said. \"And if the state can come forward with an important interest and substantiate that it needed to draw those sex baselines to substantially serve the interest,\" it would still be permitted.",

      "Respondents for the state of Tennessee argued Wednesday that SB1 was designed to protect minors from what they described as \"risky and unproven medical interventions.\"",
      "The state, represented by Tennessee Solicitor General Matthew Rice, argued that SB1 draws a \"purpose-based line, not a sex-based line,\" thus failing to meet the necessary requirement to trigger heightened scrutiny.",
      "The law, Rice said, turns \"entirely on medical purposes, not a patient\u2019s sex.\" The only way petitioners can point to a sex-based line, he argued, \"is to equate fundamentally different medical treatments.\"",
      "\"Giving testosterone to a boy with a deficiency is not the same treatment as giving it to a girl who has psychological distress associated with her body,\" Rice said.",
      "Still, respondents faced tough questioning from justices on the classification and application of SB1.",
      "On issues of classification, Justice Kentaji Brown Jackson cited parallels to the race-based case of Loving v. Virginia, which overturned Virginia's law forbidding marriage between persons of different racial categories; in that case, a White man and a Black woman.",

      "She noted that under SB1, an individual can be prescribed puberty blockers or hormone treatments if doing so is consistent with their sex, but not if it is inconsistent, asking Rice, \"So how are they different?\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan asked Rice about the application of SB1, noting the text of SB1 and one of its articulated purposes, which is to \"encourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex and to ban treatments \u2018that might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u2019\"",
      "\"You\u2019re spending a lot of time talking about what the classification is here,\" Kagan told Rice. \"And I think we've talked a good deal about that. But what produced this classification might be relevant to understanding what the classification is about.\"",

    "summary": "Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania discusses his priorities for the next Congress with Fox News Digital after he unseated six-term incumbent Rep. Matt Cartwright.",
    "story": [
      "Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, a Republican who won election to the House of Representatives in Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, discusses the concerns his voters shared on the campaign trail with Fox News Digital.",
      "Voters in Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District gave six-term incumbent Rep. Matt Cartwright, D-Pa., the boot last month in favor of a young, energetic and successful businessman who says he's ready to defend their interests in the nation's capital.",
      "Republican Rep.-elect Rob Bresnahan, 34, tells Fox News Digital in an interview that \"kitchen table issues\" helped him connect with northeastern Pennsylvanians and oust Cartwright, a progressive who had served in Congress for more than a decade.",
      "\"When we were knocking on doors and talking to people every single day over a period of 13 months, the first thing anyone had to say was, \u2018I can\u2019t afford my bills. I can't afford rent. I can't afford my mortgage. I can't afford school property taxes. I can't afford groceries,'\" Bresnahan said.",
      "Rising prices for food and gas have made living costs unaffordable for Pennsylvanians, he explained. And as voters have watched illegal immigrants overrun the southern border and be provided free food, housing and benefits, while billions in foreign aid flows out from the U.S. to other countries, they felt that foreigners were being treated better than Americans by their government, said Bresnahan.",

      "\"We're looking around at our neighbors saying, \u2018hey, what about us here?\u2019 And they couldn't help but feel that they have been put second for a long time.\"",
      "Bresnahan was a success story before he won election to the House of Representatives. A fifth-generation native of Luzerne County, at just 19 years old he was entrusted to be CFO of his grandfather's construction company, which builds electrical infrastructure for municipalities and highways throughout Pennsylvania.",
      "He spent his college years at the University of Scranton dashing back and forth between the office and class as he worked to help the business recover from the global financial crisis. His hard work paid off, the business grew and Bresnahan became CEO after graduating in 2013.",
      "\"I was still living at home with my parents and I was in and out of a dorm room and running a company with 58 employees even though I couldn\u2019t legally drink a Coors Light yet,\" he told the Citizen's Voice in 2021. \"The combination was a heavy workload but it was a sacrifice that I would make again in a second.\"",
      "But as the years passed, Bresnahan, like many Americans, felt the country was headed on the wrong track. The decisions coming from Washington, D.C., were bad for his business, his employees and the people they serve. And so, he decided to enter politics to make a difference.",
      "\"I felt that the country was not heading in the right trajectory with what is happening on our southern border. We had life essentially unaffordable for the average person. And I've always been a person to roll up my sleeves and throw myself into fire,\" Bresnahan said.",

      "Rob Bresnahan, Republican nominee for Pennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, takes the stage during a Trump campaign rally at Riverfront Sports on Oct. 9, 2024 in Scranton, Pennsylvania. (Getty Images)",
      "His winning congressional campaign focused on securing the border, cutting taxes and trimming government spending, creating \"family-sustaining jobs\" in the Keystone State and supporting law enforcement. In April, Bresnahan received an endorsement from President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "\"A successful Businessman, Rob has worked hard to Create Jobs and Grow the Economy, unlike his opponent, Matt Cartwright, who is completely beholden to Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.",
      "With the campaign behind him, Bresnahan says he and the other members of the incoming Republican majority in Congress are ready to hit the ground running with a pro-growth agenda in January.",
      "\"Securing the border. That needs to be done day one, Jan. 3 at 12:01 p.m., the day after we are all sworn in,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"I think there's going to be a big playbook, but that is a tangible win right off the bat.\"",

      "On inflation, Bresnahan says Congress and the Trump administration can tackle unaffordable prices by lowering energy costs. \"Talking about just Pennsylvania alone, 52% of homes are heated from natural gas. $45 billion a year are generated from the natural gas industry, and $76 billion in GDP comes out of the fracking and natural gas industry,\" he said, insisting that policymakers must stop \"vilifying natural resources.\"",
      "The rising national debt, at $36 trillion, is another burden on the economy Bresnahan says Congress must address. \"We're spending more on debt servicing \u2013 just our national debt and the interest \u2013 than we are on our national defense budget.\"",
      "The young lawmaker said there will be \"tough votes\" on discretionary spending when Congress convenes in January. But two of the largest contributors to the federal debt and deficit will remain untouched.",
      "\"Obviously, we can't cut Medicare. We can't cut Social Security. We have to preserve that for our current generation, and we have to find ways to preserve it for our generation and the next generation. But I don't believe that there's a one-size-fits-all policy on any circumstance, let alone the national debt and the expenditures of the federal government,\" Bresnahan said.",
      "However, he added that illegal immigrants should not benefit from programs that Americans have paid in to, including Social Security and Medicare.",

      "Republicans are expected to extend the 2017 tax cuts that became law during Trump's first term in office. Bresnahan says he supports those tax cuts and insists that economic growth spurred by deregulation and investments in infrastructure and American jobs can make up for any potential revenue losses.",
      "\"We have to get people back to work,\" he said. \"We have to create economic climates that are conducive to the American people to incentivize them to go to work.\"",
      "Part of that is to support jobs that don't require a college degree, such as carpenters, plumbers or electricians. \"These are great, family-sustaining careers with annuities starting on day one, with health insurance for your family, and you're earning while you learn.\"",
      "Turning to foreign policy, Bresnahan said the United States must remain a global superpower and pursue \"peace through strength.\"",
      "\"But we have to be strong as the United States,\" he added. Asked about growing GOP opposition to foreign aid, including to Ukraine, Bresnahan emphasized that he supports efforts to push back against Russian aggression \u2013 but he wants to do so responsibly.",
      "YOUNGEST HOUSE REPUBLICAN-ELECT REVEALS HOW GOP WON BACK AMERICA'S YOUTH",
      "\"Putin is a war criminal and needs to be stopped,\" he said. \"I am all supportive of providing weapons, missiles, rockets \u2013 actually, there's a big manufacturing facility inside of my district. But where I do want accountability is the raw, hard dollars that have been sent. I want audits done on those to ensure they're going to the right causes.\"",
      "Echoing Trump's beliefs about putting America first, Bresnahan said there is a point where \"enough is enough\" and that Europe has to match U.S. contributions to foreign aid.",
      "\"Again, I'm looking at, you know, 25% of my bridges are structurally deficient. We have aging infrastructure levees that protect over $1 trillion of property here in the United States. You're talking about power distribution grids that haven't been re-invested in since the 1950s with 50 years of usable life. And, you know, we were without power for multiple days now, going on which could possibly be a week (Editor's note: A blizzard in Breshanan's district had postponed this interview). Europe didn't come and send over trucks to help us rebuild our grids.\"",
      "\"Ukraine obviously has a lot going on, but we need to take care of our own people. We have to take care of our own Americans. And I believe Donald Trump had that narrative and that's why he just won an election in a landslide, because it's about us,\" he added.",
      "Bresnahan hopes to bring \"common sense\" solutions to the complex problems facing Americans. He has pledged to work with whomever has a good idea, Republican or Democrat, and has earned endorsements from both No Labels and the moderate Problem Solvers Caucus. Though he calls himself a \"fiscal conservative,\" he rejects political labels because \"I don't think confirmation bias is the right way to solve any issue.\"",

      "\"I believe most challenges can be overcome through healthy and solid debate,\" he added.",
      "And what about those issues that inflame passions on both sides? Before this interview, Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., made national headlines after she put forward a resolution that would bar Rep. Sarah McBride, D-Del., a transgender lawmaker who is biologically male, from using the women's bathrooms in the Capitol.",
      "Bresnahan said that while he believes biological men should not play in women's sports or use their facilities, the flare up between Mace and McBride distracts from other important issues facing Americans \u2013 like crumbling infrastructure and expensive living costs.",
      "\"I don't want the 119th Congress to be hijacked by what bathrooms we should be using when we have been elected to provide real solutions for the real American people. And that's what I'm going down to Washington, D.C. to do.\"",

      "Malicious apps are pretty common, and it's easy to accidentally download them if you're not cautious. You'll often find these apps on third-party app stores, shady websites, or through suspicious emails and texts. What you wouldn't expect is to encounter them on the Google Play Store if you're an Android user or the App Store if you're on iPhone.",

      "Images of\u00a0four of the SpyLoan apps found on Google Play (McAfee)",
      "What is SpyLoan malware?",
      "SpyLoan is malware often hidden in apps that promise instant loans. These apps reel people in with offers of quick, hassle-free loans, boasting low rates and hardly any requirements. While they might look legit at first glance, their real goal is to gather as much personal info as they can.",
      "Once they have it, they use it to harass or pressure users into paying ridiculous interest rates. They also use shady tactics like countdown timers or \"limited-time\" offers to create a fake sense of urgency, pushing people to act fast without thinking it through. Instead of helping with finances, these apps trap users in a cycle of debt and invade their privacy.",
      "McAfee's mobile research team has\u00a0uncovered 15 apps on the Google Play Store packed with SpyLoan malware. These apps use the same code and systems, targeting users worldwide to steal data and send it to command-and-control (C2) servers. Many of them hide behind fake names and logos that mimic legitimate financial institutions, making them look trustworthy at first glance. You can find the names of these apps in the screenshot added below.",

      "We reached out to Google, and a rep confirmed that Android users are automatically protected against known versions of this malware by Google Play Protect. However, it is important to note that Google Play Protect may not be enough. Historically, it isn't 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android devices.",
      "ANDROID BANKING TROJAN EVOLVES TO EVADE DETECTION AND STRIKE GLOBALLY",

Victims are often coerced into repaying loans at sky-high interest rates, with some even being threatened for delays. In extreme cases, the app operators have harassed victims' families and sent death threats, using stolen personal photos as leverage.",
      "These apps request intrusive permissions, giving them access to system data, cameras, call logs, contacts, location, and SMS messages. They justify this data collection by claiming it's necessary for user verification and anti-fraud measures.",
      "Users signing up for these services are verified through a one-time password (OTP) to confirm their phone number is from the target region. They are also pressured to share additional details like ID documents, bank accounts, and employment information.",

      "4 ways to protect yourself from SpyLoan malware",
      "1. Have strong antivirus software: Android has its own built-in malware protection called Play Protect, but the SpyLoan malware proves it\u2019s not enough. Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Download apps from reliable sources: It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. You might say I am contradicting myself, but the Play Store is still safer than other options out there. They have strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software.\u00a0However, even with the security measures provided by Google Play, downloading apps from the store does not guarantee 100% protection against malware or harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they can pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Never trust download links that you get through SMS.",
      "3. Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4. Take loans from legit institutions:\u00a0Always take loans from legitimate financial institutions like banks or well-known lenders. Avoid sketchy apps or services promising instant cash with minimal requirements. They\u2019re often too good to be true. Legit lenders are transparent about their terms, interest rates, and fees, and they won\u2019t demand access to your personal data or pressure you with scare tactics. If you\u2019re unsure about a lender, check reviews, verify their credentials, or consult a financial advisor before committing.",
      "THE HIDDEN COSTS OF FREE APPS: YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It can be tempting to use apps that promise instant loans, especially when you need the money. But they're often just trying to scam you and push you into a never-ending debt cycle. If you need a loan, go to a trusted bank or lender. Protecting yourself from malicious apps like those infected with SpyLoan malware starts with staying informed and cautious. Always scrutinize the apps you download, stick to trusted platforms, and think twice before sharing sensitive information.",

This means that any new vulnerabilities discovered in the operating system will not be patched, leaving your computer exposed to potential attacks.",
      "Since the start of 2023, 47 vulnerabilities have been discovered in Windows 7. Cybercriminals actively target outdated operating systems because they're more likely to be unpatched and vulnerable. Without official support, Microsoft is no longer compelled to disclose formal vulnerabilities, making it harder for users to stay informed about potential security risks.",

However, if a new computer isn\u2019t in your budget right now, using a supported antivirus on your Windows 7 machine is a good step.",
      "2) Install strong antivirus software: If upgrading isn't possible immediately, install a strong, reputable, up-to-date antivirus software that's compatible with Windows 7. However, keep in mind that this is a temporary solution and doesn't address all the vulnerabilities in the operating system itself. There are several antivirus programs that continue to support Windows 7.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Imagine slipping on a pair of shorts that could make walking feel like a breeze, almost as if you've instantly shed 20 pounds. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, get ready to have your mind blown! Scientists at the Technical University of Munich have cooked up something that might just change the game for anyone who's ever wished walking was a little easier.",
      "They call it the WalkON system, a pair of high-tech shorts that's not your average gym wear. These bad boys can cut down the energy you need for a stroll or jog by up to 18%! Whether you're a spring chicken or in your golden years, these shorts could be a game-changer, especially if stairs have become your nemesis or long walks leave you winded.",

      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the robotic shorts work",
      "The WalkON system combines sensors, artificial tendons and smart motors to enhance your natural walking motion. It starts with advanced sensors embedded in the shorts that continuously monitor the stress on your tendons. These sensors are incredibly precise, picking up on subtle changes in your movement, including how fast you\u2019re walking and the angle of your hips.",
      "Connected to these sensors are two thin artificial tendons that extend from your thighs to a specially designed waist belt. These tendons play a crucial role in how the system assists you. When you start to walk, the shorts analyze your gait pattern and can even detect the moment you transition from standing to walking. As each leg enters the \"swing phase,\" the system knows exactly when to kick in.",
      "At just the right moment, small but powerful motors activate and gently pull on the artificial tendons. This action helps lift your thigh, reducing the effort needed by your hip flexor muscles, making it feel much easier to move. What\u2019s really impressive is how adaptable WalkON is; whether you prefer a slow stroll or a brisk jog, the system adjusts its level of assistance based on your speed and leg weight. All of this happens seamlessly, so you experience a natural enhancement to your movement rather than feeling like you\u2019re being pushed or pulled by a machine.",

This reduction in energy expenditure is equivalent to the feeling of instantly losing 22 pounds or 13 pounds, respectively. The system allows you to walk slowly or jog, providing versatility in movement. Participants in tests reported high satisfaction with the device, giving it a mean rating of 6 out of 7 for its ability to assist while maintaining a sense of control.",

Additionally, individuals weakened by illness can find significant advantages in using WalkON to enhance their mobility and independence. Furthermore, the device is designed for those looking to maintain an active and healthy lifestyle, making it a versatile solution for a wide range of users.",

      "WEARABLE EXOSKELETON CAN TURN YOU INTO A SUPERHUMAN ATHLETE",
      "Comparison to other exoskeletons",
      "Unlike traditional rigid exoskeletons, WalkON's soft, flexible design offers several advantages over its more cumbersome counterparts. Conventional exoskeletons often feature rigid frames that can be difficult and time-consuming to put on, limiting their practicality for daily use.",
      "In contrast, WalkON's soft robotic shorts can be put on quickly and easily, similar to regular clothing, and are more than a mechanical device. Professor Lorenzia Masia, the lead researcher, aptly compares WalkON to an electric bike for walking. This analogy highlights the system's ability to enhance natural movement without overpowering it, making mobility more accessible and appealing to a wider range of users. The lightweight, tendon-driven design of WalkON allows for a more natural range of motion, adapting to the user's movements rather than constraining them.",
      "Furthermore, WalkON's compact and unobtrusive nature addresses a common concern with exoskeletons: social acceptance. Its design allows it to be worn discreetly under regular clothing, potentially increasing user comfort in social situations. This feature, combined with its efficiency in reducing metabolic cost, positions WalkON as a more practical solution for everyday use compared to bulkier exoskeleton systems.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Availability and cost",
      "Given the current stage of development and testing, it's likely that WalkON could be available to you within the next three to five years, pending further research and regulatory approvals.",
      "While no exact price point is yet available, we can compare it to other assistive technologies. Current exoskeletons can cost anywhere from $40,000 to $100,000-plus. However, given WalkON's simpler design and intended widespread use, it's possible that it could be priced more affordably, perhaps in the range of $5,000 to $15,000 when it first hits the market. As with many technologies, the price could decrease over time as production scales up.",
      "Woman wearing WalkON system (Technical University of Munich) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The WalkON system's potential to enhance mobility for people of all ages, particularly older adults and those with health challenges, is immense. By making movement easier and more efficient, WalkON could encourage more active lifestyles, potentially improving overall health and quality of life for many individuals. While questions about availability and cost remain, the development of WalkON is a promising sign that we're moving towards more accessible and user-friendly mobility assistance solutions.",

      "The worst part is that the database was left publicly accessible without password protection or encryption, allowing anyone to grab it. Anyone with the link could view and download the files. Plus, the files were named in a way that exposed personal details, using formats like \"First_Middle_Last_State.PDF.\" This made sensitive information visible even without opening the files.",

      "The database that exposed over 600,000 records belongs to SL Data Services LLC, an information research provider that appears to prioritize convenience over basic data security. The company operates a sprawling network of around 16 websites, including Propertyrec, which advertises real estate ownership data and property records. However, SL Data Services\u2019 business goes far beyond property records, offering services like criminal background checks, DMV records and even birth and death records.",
      "While Propertyrec promotes its affordability, claiming users can search for documents for as little as $1, customer reviews paint a different picture. Many users report being unknowingly enrolled in subscription services, resulting in recurring charges instead of the promised one-time fees.

      "The exposure of sensitive personal info in this breach is a big deal for the people involved. The database has detailed data about them, and that\u2019s basically a jackpot for cybercriminals. This kind of leak can lead to various dangerous outcomes.",
      "For one, attackers could use this info to run phishing scams or social engineering tricks. If they know details like your job, family or even criminal history, they can send super convincing messages to trick you into sharing even more sensitive details, like your financial info. That\u2019s not all. Criminals could also use this leaked data to impersonate someone and apply for loans, credit cards or other services in their name.",
      "What really gets me, though, is that most people whose info got leaked probably won\u2019t even find out about it unless they\u2019re using a service to remove their data. A lot of them might not have even known they were being background-checked in the first place.

      "7 ways to protect yourself from data leaks",
      "1) Remove your personal information from the internet:\u00a0While no service can promise to completely erase your data from the internet, using a data removal service is one of the best steps you can take. They do the heavy lifting by actively scanning and removing your personal information from hundreds of websites. This helps protect you from scammers who may cross-reference data from breaches with other information they find on the dark web.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2) Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0With your address exposed, bad actors could try to scam you through physical mail. They may impersonate companies or people you trust and send fake urgent letters about things like missed deliveries, account suspensions or security alerts. Be skeptical of unexpected communications and verify any claims before taking action.",
      "3) Be cautious of phishing attempts and use strong antivirus software: The leaked data could lead to phishing attacks via email, phone calls or messages from unknown sources. Be on high alert for any requests for personal information, especially if they seem urgent or ask you to click on suspicious links. Always verify the legitimacy of any request before responding.",
      "To protect your devices from malicious links, make sure you have strong antivirus protection. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Monitor your accounts: Given the scope of this breach, it\u2019s crucial to start regularly reviewing your bank accounts, credit card statements and other financial accounts. Keep an eye out for any unauthorized transactions and report them immediately to your bank or credit card company to prevent further damage.",
      "5) Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords for each of your online accounts and consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them securely.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Implement this extra layer of security on all accounts that offer it to prevent unauthorized access.",
      "7) Regularly update your software: Keep your operating system, apps and security tools\u00a0up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "It\u2019s alarming how many companies profit from collecting personal data, yet fail to protect it adequately. Recent breaches, including one exposing the sensitive information of 600,000 Americans, highlight this negligence. With unprotected databases containing everything from criminal records to addresses, cybercriminals have a treasure trove of information to exploit. This situation underscores the urgent need for you to take proactive steps to safeguard your privacy and demand better security practices from these data aggregators.",

      "In today\u2019s digital age, your phone number is more than just a way for friends and family to reach you. It can be a gateway for scammers to access your personal information and wreak havoc on your life. From\u00a0phishing attempts to extortion, the risks are numerous and varied. Here are nine ways scammers can exploit your phone number if it falls into the wrong hands:",
      "Scammers can also use your phone number to launch rather easy\u00a0phishing attacks. They might send text messages or make calls posing as your bank or a popular online service that you subscribe to. The goal is to call you and trick you into providing login credentials, credit card details or other personal information, which they can then use for fraudulent activities. And once they have all your other information, they can do a lot more damage just by having your phone number as that initial segue.",
      "In some cases, scammers use your phone number for extortion or blackmail. They may claim to have compromising information about you and demand payment to keep it private. By contacting you directly, they can apply continuous pressure, making their threats seem more real and immediate.",
      "One unique way they do this to target elderly people is by pretending to be your grandchild or another relative in distress. The scammer often claims that your grandchild is in an emergency situation \u2014 such as needing bail money or medical assistance \u2014 and urgently requests financial help. With AI voice cloning technology, they may even be able to use your grandchild's voice. This emotional manipulation usually gets the victim to pay up.",
      "This one may not be as dramatic, but your phone number can be sold to\u00a0robocall and spam message services. These automated systems bombard you with unwanted calls and texts, often promoting scams or fraudulent products. While these may seem like minor annoyances, they can lead to bigger scams if you engage with the messages or follow their instructions. Hang up on them.",
      "HOW TO STOP ANNOYING ROBOCALLS",
      "Illustration of a scammer with cash in his hand\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Phone number spoofing is a common tactic where scammers disguise their caller ID to appear as a trusted contact by calling from what appears to be a familiar number as it may have the same area code where you live, an area code where your friends or family live or even the actual phone number of someone close which you can recognize.",
      "This makes it more likely that you'll answer the call, giving them the opportunity to deceive you into revealing personal information or transferring money. This is, of course, the case when phone spoofing is used against you. But in situations where they use YOUR phone number, they can be scamming those close to you without you even knowing!",
      "With these phone spoofing tactics, scammers can use your phone number to\u00a0impersonate government officials, such as IRS agents or Social Security administrators. They may call you claiming there\u2019s an urgent issue, like unpaid taxes or suspicious activity involving your Social Security number. This ploy often involves threats of legal action or arrest to pressure you into providing sensitive information or making immediate payments.",
      "Instead of pretending to be from a government agency, another trick is for scammers to try their luck by posing as a representative from a utility company, like an electric or water company. Scammers will claim that you have an overdue invoice and threaten to cut off your service unless you pay immediately. Using your phone number, they can contact you repeatedly, making the scam seem more legitimate (and pressing).",
      "SIM swapping or a\u00a0port-out scam is when scammers transfer your phone number to a new SIM card in their possession. By convincing your mobile carrier to reroute your number, they can receive all your calls and messages, including those containing two-factor authentication codes. This allows them to bypass security measures and take over your online accounts.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "With SIM swapping techniques/port-out, scammers can also use your phone number as a key to access sensitive data stored in your online accounts. By initiating password resets and intercepting verification codes sent via SMS, they can gain unauthorized access to your email, social media and banking accounts, leading to significant personal and financial damage.",
      "Finally, scammers can use all the tactics above to not only access the accounts you already have but also create fake online accounts in your name. These accounts can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as spreading malware, launching further scams or conducting identity theft. The presence of your phone number makes these accounts appear more legitimate, increasing the chances of deceiving others.",

      "1. Be cautious about sharing your phone number publicly: Avoid posting your phone number on public forums, websites or social media platforms where it can be easily accessed by scammers.",
      "2. Limit exposure of your phone number on social media and other online platforms:\u00a0Use privacy settings to restrict who can see your contact information.

      "7. Use an identity theft protection service: Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "One of the best parts of using some services is that they might include identity theft insurance of up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white glove fraud resolution team where a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.

However, some industries are pushing back against certain aspects of AI. And some industry leaders are working to balance the good and the bad.",
      "\"We are looking at critical infrastructure owners and operators, businesses from water and health care and transportation and communication, some of which are starting to integrate some of these AI capabilities,\" said U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Jen Easterly. \"We want to make sure that they're integrating them in a way where they are not introducing a lot of new risk.\"",
      "US AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY TESTS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE: 'A LOT OF POTENTIAL'",
      "Consulting firm Deloitte recently surveyed leaders of business organizations from around the world. The findings showed uncertainty over government regulations was a bigger issue than actually implementing AI technology. When asked about the top barrier to deploying AI tools, 36% ranked regulatory compliance first, 30% said difficulty managing risks, and 29% said lack of a governance model.",
      "Easterly says despite some of the risks AI can pose, she said she is not surprised that the government has not taken more steps to regulate the technology.",
      "\"These are going to be the most powerful technologies of our century, probably more,\" Easterly said. \"Most of these technologies are being built by private companies that are incentivized to provide returns for their shareholders. So we do need to ensure that government has a role in establishing safeguards to ensure that these technologies are being built in a way that prioritizes security. And that's where I think that Congress can have a role in ensuring that these technologies are as safe and secure to be used and implemented by the American people.\"",

      "The Ensuring Likeness Voice and Image Security Act, or ELVIS Act, classifies vocal likeness as a property right. Lee signed the legislation this year, making Tennessee the first state to enact protections for singers. Illinois and California have since passed similar laws. Other states, including Tennessee, have laws that determine names, photographs and likenesses are also considered a property right.",

Both groups scored around 75% accuracy, while the chatbot alone scored above 90%.",

      "\"We want to use these capabilities to ensure that we can better defend the critical infrastructure that Americans rely on every hour of every day,\" Easterly said.",
      "The European Union passed regulations for AI this year. It ranks risks from minimal, which have no regulations, to unacceptable, which are banned.

According to recent studies, this single mega-slump is responsible for releasing 4,000 to 5,000 tons of organic carbon every year. That's equivalent to the annual emissions of about 1,000 cars. This release of carbon, previously locked away in the frozen ground, further contributes to global warming, potentially accelerating the very process that created the crater in the first place.",

      "The Batagaika crater, while extreme, is not unique. It represents a process happening across the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. As our planet continues to warm, more of these massive permafrost thaw features are likely to appear. While some might see the crater as a tourist attraction \u2013 and indeed it has become one \u2013 it's crucial to recognize it as a warning sign. The \"Gateway to Hell\" is more than just a catchy nickname; it's a portal into a possible future where rapid environmental changes reshape our world in ways we're only beginning to understand. The question remains: Will we heed the warning signs and take action, or will we continue to watch as more gateways open across our warming world?",

    "summary": "The Ronald Reagan Institute released its sixth annual National Defense Survey and found &apos;record high&apos; support for U.S. involvement abroad despite a growing sense that isolationism could be on the rise.",
    "story": [
      "Rachel Hoff, Policy Director at the Ronald Reagan Institute tells Fox News Digital the vast majority of Americans prioritize national security and foreign policy despite campaign rhetoric suggesting otherwise.",
      "FIRST ON FOX: An overwhelming majority of Americans view foreign policy and national defense as being \"somewhat\" or \"extremely\" important to them, according to a new survey from the Ronald Reagan Institute that also weighed U.S. attitudes about rival nations and revealed which is viewed as posing the \"greatest threat\" to the country.",
      "As Americans await another change in the White House while the Biden and Trump administrations prepare for the executive reshuffle, and uncertainty has set the tone for what the U.S.\u2019s geopolitical future will look like amid increasingly volatile relations with nations like Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, there is stark uniformity in the way Americans view the topic of national defense.",
      "\"Americans who cast their votes for different candidates share an unshakable core set of beliefs: the United States must lead on the world stage, backed by a strong military that can secure the peace through its strength,\" the Ronald Reagan Institute said in a report first obtained by Fox News Digital detailing its 2024 National Defense Survey results.",
      "US 'SLEEPWALKING' INTO WWIII, EXPERTS WARN NATION IS UNDERPREPARED: 'WE DO NOT HAVE OUR CHURCHILL'",
      "The survey\u2019s results \u2013 which reflected the answers from some 2,500 questionnaires issued between Nov. 8-14 through telephone and online based platforms \u2013 not only highlight that U.S. security and foreign policy issues remain important topics, but they also indicated that the U.S. should take the lead in major international issues.",
      "The opinion shows a divergence from the position frequently pushed by president-elect Donald Trump, who has long championed an \"America first\" policy, which some fear could isolate the U.S. during a geopolitically turbulent time as Russia\u2019s aggression continues to ramp up in Europe, Iran remains a chief threat in the Middle East, and China continues to pose a threat politically, militarily and economically.",
      "\"I think it's really interesting to compare some of the campaign rhetoric that we saw, frankly, from both candidates, and see where that is and is not resonating with the American people,\" Rachael Hoff Policy Director at the Ronald\u00a0Reagan Institute, told Fox News Digital in reference to both Trump and his previous campaign challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "The survey also found that since the annual poll began six years ago, \"a record high\" number of Americans support \"U.S. leadership and international engagement\" with a strong support for a global military posture.",

      "\"This represents a significant 15-point increase since just last year and a steady upward trend from a low-point in the early 2020s,\" the report said, noting that this shift was most prevalent among younger survey takers which saw a 32-point jump this year for those under the age of 30, along with a 19-point increase for those between the ages of 30 and 44.",
      "WHAT DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT DONALD TRUMP\u2019S WIN MEAN FOR US AMID WAR BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE?",
      "The drive for more U.S. involvement abroad particularly in East Asia, which includes areas like China and the Korean peninsula, the Middle East and Europe reflects the growing concern Americans have over not only the burgeoning alliance between Russia, Iran, North Korea and China, but on whether the U.S.\u00a0 military can stand up to these nations.",
      "While more than half of male survey takers, 59%, said they believe the U.S. could win a war against China, the female participants were more skeptical with only 45% expressing the same confidence, while 23% said they were unsure compared to 18% of male participants expressing the same.",
      "President Ronald Reagan waves to the crowd.",

      "While it remains unclear why female participants were less confident in the U.S. military, the majority of survey takers collectively agreed that China is the U.S.\u2019s greatest threat, though Russia as the U.S.\u2019s chief enemy.",
      "TIRED OF UKRAINE? REMEMBER SOUTH VIETNAM",
      "\"One of the biggest trends that we've seen in the last three or four years in the poll is really the consensus growing that China is the is the greatest threat that we face \u2013 \u00a0that's really resonating with the American people, and it's something that clearly we've heard on a bipartisan basis from national security leaders in Washington,\" Hoff said. \u00a0That doesn't mean that Americans don't perceive Russia, Iran, North Korea, or even the cooperation between those malign actors as a threat.",

      "\"In fact, one interesting takeaway from our poll this year is that 85% of Americans, a huge percentage\u2026are concerned about the cooperation and collaboration between Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, and we're seeing that play out under the front lines in Ukraine,\" Hoff added. \"We're seeing it play out in the Middle East and it's something that Americans want our government to understand and to get after.\"",
      "Hoff explained that though the survey \u2013 which reflected information made clear in the lead up to and after the U.S. general election \u2013 showed Americans prioritize paying for domestic issues like healthcare, border security and social security above the military and foreign policy-based initiatives, national security and geopolitics remain a major issue for Americans.",
      "\"What we see from the poll across the board is that they don't see foreign policy and national security as something that they want to divest from,\" she said. \"When asked to sort of put those in competition with each other, that's where it gets really, really tough.",
      "\"But they clearly want their government to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time,\" Hoff said. \"The perception that there's kind of a growing isolationist sentiment in this country really doesn't bear out in the data.",

      "\"There's a lot of rhetoric \u2013 whether you listen to the debates on Capitol Hill or the debates in the media \u2013 that would lead you to believe that the American people want to want the U.S. to do less in the world, that they want us to take a step back from international leadership. And it turns out, when you ask the American people, that's simply not the case,\" Hoff said.",
      "\"They want America to lead from a position of strength. They want us to have a strong military,\" she continued. \"They want us to stand up for the values of freedom and democracy around the world. And that's true on a bipartisan basis among both Republicans and Democrats, those who voted for President Trump and has voted for Vice President Harris.\"",

      "The cease-fire, brokered by the U.S. and France, took effect on Nov. 27 and aims to halt over a year of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah. Under its terms, Hezbollah is required to withdraw north of the Litani River, and Israeli forces will pull back from southern Lebanon within 60 days. The agreement marks a significant step but faces immediate challenges, with both sides accusing the other of violations. Against this backdrop, the role of the United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon (UNIFIL) is facing renewed scrutiny.",
      "On Monday, Hezbollah launched two projectiles at Mount Dov, alleging Israeli cease-fire violations. Responding to the launches, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated in Hebrew on X: \"Hezbollah\u2019s fire toward Mount Dov constitutes a serious violation of the cease-fire, and Israel will respond forcefully. We are determined to continue enforcing the cease-fire and to respond to any violation by Hezbollah-whether minor or severe.\"",

      "Javed Ali, a former U.S. counterterrorism official and an associate professor at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, highlighted UNIFIL\u2019s challenges in enforcing U.N. Security Council resolution 1701. \"The same issues are likely to manifest again under the revised UNSCR 1701, although in this current iteration, both the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL will be charged with overseeing the implementation of the resolution and ensuring that Hezbollah is unable to violate its terms or rebuild an operational infrastructure south of the Litani River that could once again threaten Israel.\"",
      "Ali also pointed to historical U.N. peacekeeping failures, such as those in Somalia, Rwanda and the Balkans, as cautionary examples. \"In decades past, there are other examples of the limitations of U.N. peacekeeping elements to prevent either the outbreak or dramatic escalation of armed conflict between combatants in similarly small countries with complex ethnic, tribal, or religious divisions.\"",

      "A documentary filmed in the southern Lebanon village of Houla a few weeks prior to the cease-fire captured Israeli reserve soldiers as they moved cautiously from house to house, clearing each room as they advanced through a Hezbollah stronghold. Gunfire erupted suddenly, forcing the troops to take cover as Hezbollah terrorists fired at them from nearby homes. The exchange intensified, with bullets cutting through the air, when an unexpected sight left the soldiers stunned: a UNIFIL convoy driving directly into the firefight.",
      "The white U.N. vehicle crossed the road separating the Israeli soldiers from Hezbollah fighters, coming to a halt amid the smoke and chaos. A UNIFIL peacekeeper stepped out, seemingly oblivious to the life-threatening battle unfolding around him. \"It was a total surprise. The IDF soldiers were shocked,\" said Itai Anghel, an Israeli journalist embedded with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). \"The timing of the convoy\u2019s arrival, as well as its route, made the soldiers suspect coordination with Hezbollah.\"",

      "Anghel, a veteran war reporter for the Israeli TV program \"Uvda,\" described the bizarre scene. \"This was not my first time in Houla. I documented the battle here during the Second Lebanon War 18 years ago, but this time, it was worse,\" he said. \"Every second or third house in the village was packed with weapons - RPGs, rockets, tunnels - all aimed at storming Israeli villages just a few kilometers away.\"",
      "As the battle raged, Anghel witnessed the soldiers\u2019 frustrations with UNIFIL\u2019s presence. \"They don\u2019t trust them,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"One soldier even told me, \u2018If we leave these villages for UNIFIL to manage, it will all revert to how it was before - nothing will change.\u2019\"",
      "An IDF official told Fox News Digital that during the 14 months of fighting in South Lebanon, \"We\u2019ve seen Hezbollah use U.N. convoys to get close to the border - a Hezbollah car just entered the convoy and tagged along with them to safely gather intelligence. Cameras operated by Hezbollah have even been found on the fences of UNIFIL facilities. In one case, we discovered a massive tunnel just a few meters from a UNIFIL base. Think of the noise and effort required to dig a tunnel in stone - it\u2019s impossible they didn\u2019t know.\"",
      "A former special unit IDF fighter, who asked to stay anonymous, described what he witnessed during his service in southern Lebanon. \"We\u2019d see UNIFIL on one side and Hezbollah just meters away on the other,\" he said. \"Over time, Hezbollah became bolder, setting up tents right on the border. Everyone played the game - they knew Hezbollah was there, walking freely among them. And nothing was done.\"",
      "UNIFIL responded to the criticism by emphasizing its limited mandate. \"The implementation of Resolution 1701 is the responsibility of the parties, Lebanon and Israel,\" Andrea Teneti, a UNIFIL spokesperson, said. \"UNIFIL supports the parties\u2019 implementation, monitors, and reports on violations. We do not have the mandate to enforce the resolution, nor to disarm Hezbollah by force.\"",
      "The spokesperson pointed to the unprecedented period of stability from 2006 to 2023 as evidence of UNIFIL\u2019s contributions, despite both parties failing to implement their obligations. UNIFIL acknowledged that the proliferation of weapons outside state control in southern Lebanon remains a violation of Resolution 1701, adding, \"The removal of unauthorized weapons can only be achieved through the full implementation of Resolution 1701. There is no military solution.\"",

      "\"Since UNSCR 1701\u2019s implementation, Hezbollah has successfully circumvented nearly all its conditions,\" Ali told Fox New Digital, adding \"By doing so, the group was able to create fortified bunkers, weapons caches, command posts for mobile fighting squads, and firing positions for rockets, mortars, and other projectiles used to attack Israeli civilian and military targets - which increased exponentially in the aftermath of October 7, 2023. By all accounts, UNIFIL did little to prevent this operational buildup or prevent the escalation in Hezbollah attacks after October 7.\"",
      "Following Hamas\u2019s Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Hezbollah opened another front in the war along the northern border, launching hundreds of rockets, anti-tank missiles and UAVs into Israeli territory. Alarmingly, many of these attacks originated near UNIFIL bases. \"Over 430 Hezbollah projectiles have landed in and around UNIFIL outposts,\" an IDF military official reported. \"Yet the U.N. has only twice named Hezbollah explicitly as responsible for these attacks.\"",
      "\"The actions of both the IDF and Hezbollah are putting peacekeepers in danger, whether through crossfire or deliberate acts\", said Teneti. \"We name a party only when we are sure about the source of fire impacting the mission and Hezbollah has been mentioned several times as responsible for some of those attacks.\"",
      "The IDF has provided Fox News Digital with further evidence of Hezbollah\u2019s violations, including fortified positions and training centers. In one instance, a Hezbollah facility packed with weapons and attack plans was discovered just 200 meters from a UNIFIL base. \"You had to walk past the facility to even reach the U.N. base,\" an IDF officer noted.",
      "The IDF said its \"soldiers are continuing to conduct limited, localized, targeted raids in southern Lebanon, eliminating Hezbollah terrorists and dismantling terror infrastructure and weapons stockpiles both above and below ground.\" (IDF spokesman's unit)",
      "Michael, a former Danish soldier who served with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, reflected on his time in southern Lebanon. \"Hezbollah controlled all the areas we were supposed to monitor,\" he told the Danish newspaper BT. \"We couldn\u2019t operate at night out of fear, and taking photos was prohibited. Despite daily reports of violations, nothing happened.\"",
      "As more violations of the cease-fire are reported, Israeli officials are concerned that Hezbollah\u2019s continued presence in southern Lebanon will lead to renewed violence, while UNIFIL insists its role is limited to monitoring and reporting.",

      "Experts believe that for now, the ceasefire has provided a momentary reprieve, but whether it can hold remains uncertain. With Hezbollah entrenched and Israel skeptical of UNIFIL\u2019s efficacy, the peacekeeping mission\u2019s role is more critical - and contested - than ever.",

      "Chilean economist Axel Kaiser, Senior Fellow at the Archbridge Institute, told Fox News Digital: \"All of Latin America will benefit from Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, because he really cares about Latin America, and he is aware of the socialist threat in our region, and therefore he will take measures that will put pressure on left-wing authoritarian governments or those with left-wing authoritarian projects, such as Mexico, to stay at bay.

    "title": "Lead in gasoline tied to over 150 million excess cases of mental health disorders, study suggests",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 23:01:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The U.S. population experienced an estimated 151 million excess mental health disorders attributable to exposure to lead from car exhaust, according to a study.",
    "story": [
      "Exposure to lead in gasoline during childhood resulted in many millions of excess cases of psychiatric disorders over the last 75 years, a new study estimates.",
      "Lead was banned from automobile fuel in 1996. The study, published Wednesday in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, looked at its lasting impact in the U.S. by analyzing childhood blood lead levels from 1940 to 2015. According to the findings, the national population experienced an estimated 151 million excess mental health disorders attributable to exposure to lead from car exhaust during children\u2019s early development.",
      "The exposure made generations of Americans more depressed, anxious, inattentive or hyperactive, the study says.",
      "The researchers \u2014 a group from Duke University, Florida State University and the Medical University of South Carolina \u2014 found that the exposure also lowered people\u2019s capacity for impulse control and made them more inclined to be neurotic.",
      "Lead-associated mental health and personality differences were most pronounced for people born between 1966 and 1986, according to the study. Of that group, the greatest lead-linked mental illness burden was for Generation Xers born between 1966 and 1970, coinciding with peak use of leaded gasoline in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s.",
      "People born during those years \u201ccan\u2019t go back in time and change that,\u201d said Aaron Reuben, a co-author of the study and a postdoctoral scholar in neuropsychology at Duke and the Medical University of South Carolina.",
      "\u201cStudies like ours today add more evidence that removing lead from our environment and not putting it there in the first place has more benefits than we previously understood,\u201d Reuben said.",
      "The groups born around 1940 and 2015 had the lowest lead exposure and lead-associated mental illness, the study reported.",
      "Though no longer in gasoline, lead is still present in other sources, such as some toys imported from other countries, water service lines that have not yet been updated, some soil and paint in old houses. (Lead paint was banned in 1978.)",
      "There is no safe level of exposure to lead, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even small amounts are associated with developmental and learning difficulties,\u00a0 given that lead exposure is known to harm the brain and the nervous and reproductive systems. Children under 6 years old are most vulnerable to lead poisoning.",
      "The study published Wednesday combined data on blood lead levels and estimates of historical lead exposure with findings from past studies, including a 2019 study of nearly 600 New Zealand residents that followed kids exposed to lead and measured their mental health over more than three decades.",
      "Reuben, who was the lead author of that study, said the new research \u201cdoesn\u2019t create new information about whether lead causes harm, nor do we say this is a study that proves causation \u2014\u00a0we\u2019re really just taking existing evidence and applying it to the whole U.S. population.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not at all concerned that we have in any way overestimated the harm,\u201d he added.",
      "Dr. Lisa Fortuna, chair of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Council on Children, Adolescents and Their Families, praised the study.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t often get to see a lot of studies that look at environmental, or toxin-related, potential associated risks with the development of elevated rates of mental health problems in populations,\u201d she said. \u201cThe research shed some light on the profound and lasting impact of environmental factors.\u201d",
      "The study\u2019s findings should not be cause for panic, Fortuna said.",
      "\u201cIt does not mean that people are, I would say, stuck with a mental illness. It doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re necessarily going to have a higher risk,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really an issue of, \u2018Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened at a population level.\u2019\u201d",
      "The study comes a couple of years after Reuben and other researchers found that exposure to leaded gasoline lowered the IQ of about half the U.S. population. That study estimated that childhood exposure to lead from gasoline cost Americans about 824 million IQ points.",
      "Lead was originally added to gasoline to improve engine performance. Use of leaded gas increased after World War II until it proved damaging to catalytic converters, which became required in the 1970s. Some of lead\u2019s hazards were known long before it was banned from gasoline, but reducing exposure to it did not become a federal priority for many years.",
      "Lead screenings are now recommended for all young children, with treatment such as chelation therapy available to remove the poison if levels are high.",
      "Reuben said prevention is the best way to keep people safe.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of good in the U.S. reducing lead exposures. Blood lead levels have gone way down, but they could go down further,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that we can learn from the history about how much harm we caused in the U.S., and try to apply that moving forward.\u201d"

      "Southern resident killer whales are critically endangered and most likely on a path toward extinction.",
      "A killer whale was spotted balancing a salmon on its head earlier this fall near the coastline in Washington state, surprising scientists and intriguing orca watchers.",
      "The critically endangered southern resident killer whale was photographed with a \u201csalmon hat\u201d in late October near Point No Point, just off the northern tip of Washington\u2019s\u00a0Kitsap Peninsula, according to the Orca Network, a nonprofit focused on the species\u2019 conservation.",
      "The whale is known to marine biologists and whale watchers as J27, though it is also called Blackberry. Groups like the Orca Network track sightings of individual whales.",
      "Orcas were previously spotted sporting salmon on their heads in the late 1980s, said Deborah Giles, science and research director of Wild Orca, a nonprofit conservation and research group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that seemingly popped up out of nowhere in the 80s,\u201d she said, adding that the behavior then apparently faded away for decades. It\u2019s not clear what the behavior means, she said.",
      "Giles spends a lot of time on the water and near orcas for her research. She uses trained dogs on boats to sniff out and collect the whales\u2019 feces to analyze their health.",
      "In early November, Giles said she saw a southern resident killer whale exhibit the salmon-on-head behavior \u2014\u00a0the second recent observation of it. She\u2019s not sure if the whale she saw was J27 or not.",
      "\u201cWhat I saw was the head of the whale and fish on the head. I didn\u2019t see the dorsal fin or saddle patch,\u201d she said, referring to the parts of the whales\u2019 bodies used for identification.",
      "Giles added that she can recall seeing southern resident killer whales do that four or five times since 2005.",
      "She speculated that a whale exhibiting such behavior could be saving salmon to share with another member of its pod, playing with the fish or using it as part of a social behavior. This fall, a hearty run of chum salmon drew the pod of killer whales to Puget Sound waters, she said. The whale with a salmon on its head was almost assuredly getting enough to eat at the time.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s indicative of a well-fed whale. If they\u2019re starving, which they often are, they\u2019re just going to eat it,\u201d Giles said. \u201cWhen there\u2019s more food, they have an opportunity to socialize more or forgo a meal. They have an opportunity to interact with things in their environment.\u201d",
      "The behavior has drawn some headlines suggesting that the whales have resurrected a decades-old fad. But Howard Garrett, president of the Orca Network, said he\u2019s not convinced there is evidence of a trend.",
      "\u201cWhen the Southern Resident Orcas visit the inland waters of Puget Sound, there is no shortage of eyes on the water and cameras capturing their visit,\u201d Garrett said in a statement. \u201cIf the salmon \u2018wearing\u2019 behavior exhibited by the whale known to local whale enthusiasts as J27 Blackberry was, in fact, a revival of the old trend, there would be ample documentation of that.\u201d",
      "Southern resident killer whales, which typically spend several months in Puget Sound each year, are critically endangered and protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The whales rely on fish \u2014\u00a0preferably Chinook salmon\u00a0\u2014 and live in three pods called J, K and L.",
      "The southern residents have been in the spotlight of conservation efforts for decades.",
      "Beginning in the 1960s, many southern resident whales were captured and transported to marine parks. By 1974, just 71 were left in the wild. Since then, the population has fluctuated, reaching a high of 99 in 1995, but trending toward decline since then.",
      "Giles said 72 of the whales are alive today. Research published in April suggests the population is on a path toward extinction.",
      "The whales face a number of threats, including declining quantity and quantity of prey, toxic pollution and disturbance from vessel noise, according to the Marine Mammal Commission. Washington state has invested hundreds of millions into orca recovery measures and even more into efforts to increase key salmon populations. But that has not turned things around for the species yet.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just not happening fast enough,\u201d Giles said. \u201cWhat we really need to be focusing on is making sure there\u2019s ample prey for these whales throughout their entire range and throughout the entire year.\u201d"

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:09:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's pick for FBI director, Kash Patel, has vowed to \"come after\" the media. But he also later emphasized to NBC News that his comments only apply if people \"broke the law.\"",
    "story": [
      "Since Donald Trump announced Kash Patel as his pick for FBI director, a 2023 podcast interview he did with fellow Trump loyalist Steve Bannon has circulated far and wide.",
      "In the recording last year, Patel asserted how he would handle reporters if he were put in power.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to come after the people in the media who lied about American citizens, who helped Joe Biden rig presidential elections,\u201d Patel said then. \u201cWhether it\u2019s criminally or civilly, we\u2019ll figure that out.\u201d",
      "Now that Patel is in the running to head one of the most powerful agencies in the U.S. government, the question of whether he will really \u201ccome after\u201d journalists is troubling both sides of the aisle, and it is likely to become a central point of contention if he comes up for Senate confirmation, with one senator calling his remarks \u201cvile.\u201d Patel has privately conceded he needs to publicly clean up the remark, according to a Trump ally who has spoken with him.",
      "In a brief interview with NBC News in February, Patel laughed off the notion that he was hellbent on attacking reporters and even praised them as \u201cinvaluable.\u201d He backed off a bit on his tough talk with Bannon, seeming to suggest that he believed his words had been blown out of proportion and adding that he had meant for his threat to apply only to people who had broken the law.",
      "\u201cI would love for you to go back and get the whole quote and I appreciate you letting me talk about it,\u201d Patel told NBC News then. \u201cThat full quote kind of speaks for itself. It was three words taken out of two sentences. But I basically said we\u2019re going to use the Constitution and the courts of law to go after people criminally and civilly \u2014 if they broke the law.\u201d",
      "He emphasized that the threshold was violating the law and accused some \u201cfolks in the media\u201d of coordinating with the government to put out a false narrative about Trump.",
      "\"I have a problem with that,\" Patel said. \"And I think there should be some form of accountability for it. I don\u2019t know what that looks like.\"",
      "He also went on to compliment journalists.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always said this, I think reporters are invaluable. Like, who else is going to tell the world what\u2019s going on in Washington or wherever, right?\u201d he said.",
      "Still, those statements are unlikely to quell the concerns of those who view Patel as a personification of Trump\u2019s vow to pursue retribution against his enemies once he takes office. Critics fear Patel\u2019s fierce loyalty to Trump and his history of embracing conspiracy theories, like a false contention that the \u201cdeep state\u201d attempted to overthrow Trump\u2019s presidency, would influence his actions at the FBI. They point to his deep investment in the MAGA movement as evidence of his motivations and of how steeped he is in politics, something that both Democrats and Republicans contend they want to keep out of the law enforcement agency.",
      "Trump\u2019s choice of Patel defies a post-Watergate practice that FBI directors serve 10-year terms. The goal of a lengthy term is to ensure that the FBI is seen as not serving the political interests of a specific president. The current FBI director, Christopher Wray, is scheduled to complete his term in 2027.",
      "In an interview this year on a YouTube show hosted by former Navy SEAL Shawn Ryan, Patel said he would \u201cshut down\u201d the bureau\u2019s headquarters in Washington, D.C., and \u201creopen it the next day as a museum of the \u2018deep state.\u2019\u201d",
      "Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning journalism watchdog group Media Matters for America, said he fully expects the Trump administration to take a confrontational approach with the media and warned it could have a chilling effect on reporting.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to be responsive not just to what Trump is saying, but also to what that larger underlying right wing media ecosystem is  calling for and demanding,\u201d Carusone said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t discount the blood thirst that\u2019s out there. People want revenge.\u201d",
      "Asked what Patel\u2019s intentions are with respect to journalists, a Trump transition spokesperson said the nominee\u2019s focus would be trained on traditional FBI values.",
      "\u201cKash Patel is going to deliver on President Trump\u2019s mandate to restore integrity to the FBI and return the agency to its core mission of protecting America,\u201d Alex Pfeiffer, the spokesperson, said in a statement. \u201cKash is committed to safeguarding Americans\u2019 First Amendment rights, unlike Joe Biden who weaponized the DOJ to target journalists.\u201d",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FBI raided the home of conservative provocateur James O'Keefe, the founder of the since-disbanded Project Veritas, securing search warrants for his notes and cellphone in connection to an investigation into the theft of a journal belonging to Biden\u2019s daughter. (O'Keefe was never charged  in the investigation, which resulted in the conviction of another person.) Then-President Barack Obama did not have a good reputation when it came to press freedoms; he targeted journalists and their work as he sought to root out government officials who were leaking information pertaining to national security. And Trump himself has had a storied, combative relationship with the news media, often referring to it as \"the enemy of the people.\"",
      "Now, Patel\u2019s past remarks to Bannon are leaving some on the right unsettled.",
      "Mike Davis, a pugnacious Trump ally and former Senate GOP chief counsel for nominations, said he\u2019s talked to Patel and he recognizes the need to clean up some of his comments about using law enforcement power against the media.",
      "He said some of Patel\u2019s remarks shouldn\u2019t be taken too literally, comparing them to his own.",
      "\u201cKash and I use hyperbole to force people to pay attention to our broader point: politicizing and weaponizing intel agencies and law enforcement is very destructive to our republic,\u201d said Davis, who runs the conservative group Article III Project and informally advises some Trump nominees. \u201cThe FBI must return to its core mission of protecting Americans from crime.\u201d",
      "Patel\u2019s remarks could invite a grilling from some Republican senators on the Judiciary Committee, which oversees the FBI and its nominees, during a confirmation hearing.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, a senior member of the panel, said he plans to ask Patel to \"clarify\" some of his past remarks, including those regarding the use of law enforcement power against people \u201cin the media.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how much of it was rhetorical and how much of it was serious,\" Cornyn told NBC News.",
      "For Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, Patel\u2019s comments are a major red flag.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s got to be off limits,\u201d Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., said Tuesday. \u201cThe awesome power of the prosecutor, FBI or [attorney general] \u2014 it has to be about protecting the American people and public safety. Not prosecuting or persecuting the press, political opponents or people you just don\u2019t like.\"",
      "\u201cI hope every senator has that concern. And Patel has got to address that,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe\u2019s been very explicit about his intentions to use the power to pursue political advocacy. That\u2019s his words, not mine.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said she hasn\u2019t decided how she would handle Patel\u2019s nomination if he were to come before the committee. But she argued that he \u2014 and other Trump nominees \u2014 should first get an FBI background check before they move forward.",
      "When asked about Patel\u2019s past remarks about going after the media, Hirono deadpanned: \u201cThat goes into the category of misuse of power.\u201d",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., a Judiciary Committee member and former prosecutor, said Patel\u2019s comments are \u201ctotally disqualifying\u201d and \u201chead-spinning\u201d for anyone who could be in charge of the FBI.",
      "\u201cI know from having been a prosecutor and U.S. attorney, part of the Department of Justice \u2014 it\u2019s not just the conviction that dooms a person\u2019s life. It is the investigation. For neighbors and co-workers to know that the FBI is investigating you, and the head of the FBI claims you committed a crime, that can be crippling financially and personally,\u201d he said.",
      "For senators like Blumenthal, walking those remarks back may not be enough.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how you can roll back those kinds of vile, vicious comments. I would say anyone who talks that way is disqualified,\u201d the senator said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how someone can be a credible director of the FBI having made those comments.\u201d"

      "The case has been stalled for most of the year as Trump's lawyers have challenged a ruling that denied their request to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and her office from prosecuting the case on conflict-of-interest grounds.",

      "In their filing, Trump lawyers Steven Sadow, Jennifer Little and Matthew Winchester contended Trump's election win is grounds to throw the case out altogether. They cited a Justice Department legal memo that held that presidents can't be prosecuted while they're in office. The Justice Department relied on the memo in deciding to dismiss two federal criminal cases against Trump last month, but the Georgia case is a state case, not a federal case.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 20:27:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Watchdog group Public Citizen asked the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Dr. Mehmet Oz for allegedly violating influencer marketing standards.",
    "story": [
      "The consumer protection watchdog group Public Citizen asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate allegations that Dr. Mehmet Oz violated the FTC\u2019s influencer marketing standards.",
      "In numerous videos posted to his various social media channels, Oz, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick to direct the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, has promoted herbal supplements.",
      "The day before Thanksgiving, Oz posted a video on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X about the stress relief benefits of ashwagandha, a shrub found in Asia and Africa. Oz referred his 11 million followers to a \u201ctrusted source\u201d to buy the herbal supplement, an online marketplace called iHerb. On social media, Oz says he is the company\u2019s global adviser and a stakeholder.",
      "Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the Trump transition team, said, \u201cAll nominees and appointees will comply with the ethical obligations of their respective agencies.\u201d",
      "Robert Weissman, a co-president of Public Citizen, said in a letter to the FTC on Tuesday that some of Oz\u2019s videos advertising herbal supplements may have violated influencer marketing guidelines by not disclosing that Oz has a financial connection to the brands. The FTC declined to comment to NBC News, saying it does not comment on communications or complaints from outside entities.",
      "\u201cDr. Oz posts regularly with appeals to consumers to consider buying products from iHerb. Video posts do not disclose his financial connections, nor does the accompanying text. Nor do the posts contain other disclosures such as #ad,\u201d Weissman wrote in a review of Oz\u2019s posts across platforms.",
      "Known as \u201cAmerica\u2019s doctor\u201d during his successful TV career, Oz has also been known for controversial and unsupported health claims, including his promotion of ingredients and foods that are purported to help with weight loss and avoiding cancer.",
      "While several of Trump\u2019s choices for his Cabinet, agency heads and administration staff have social media platforms, Oz has one of the biggest followings, and he has engaged in the most transparent influencer marketing. While deceptive campaign ads and influencer endorsements were big topics in the past election cycle, political figures possibly engaging in undisclosed influencer marketing is a newer issue.",
      "\u201cWith that knowledge, consumers can hopefully apply the appropriate emotional and intellectual filters to advertisements, discounting puffery and claims of authenticity. By contrast, disguised advertisements are inherently deceptive, because consumers do not know to apply appropriate screens,\u201d Weissman wrote about the right for consumers to know if they are viewing an advertisement. \u201cThe issue is acute with disguised ads featuring paid endorsements, where deceived consumers believe admired celebrities are making genuine, self-directed and enthusiastic endorsements of brands, not realizing that those celebrities are instead paid and may not even use the touted brand.\u201d",
      "NBC News has reported that on TikTok, where he has 1.1 million followers, Oz has advertised iHerb products through the TikTok Shop marketplace as recently as September, using the in-app feature that allows TikTok users to buy items shown in videos in just three clicks. The most recent iHerb videos Oz posted to TikTok have not used the shop feature, and they have a label that says, \u201cCreator earns commission,\u201d but they do not indicate Oz\u2019s relationship to the brand.",
      "Weissman wrote that the TikTok commission labels may not sufficiently meet FTC influencer marketing standards for disclosing Oz\u2019s interests in the brand and are most \u201clikely automated\u201d by TikTok. He also wrote that Oz\u2019s posts on X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram do not include such labels.",
      "While Oz discloses his position at iHerb in his bios on Instagram, X and TikTok, he does not disclose it on Facebook, where he has his largest following, 5.4 million. The FTC says in its guidelines that individual posts should include disclosures in text and in audio if the posts are videos, with disclosures in bios not being sufficient.",
      "In the comments on Oz\u2019s most recent posts for iHerb on Instagram and Facebook, NBC News viewed multiple accounts thanking him for his advice and celebrating his pending appointment. The comments were mostly positive, and some asked Oz to keep the Medicare and Medicaid systems as is or expand coverage to them. On X, NBC News viewed mainly negative comments, several of which called him a \u201cgrifter.\u201d On TikTok, NBC News viewed dozens of comments fearing for America\u2019s future and making fun of Oz for using TikTok Shop.",
      "\u201cOMG WE ARE COOKED\u201d was the top TikTok comment, using a slang term referring to impending consequences. \u201cHe\u2019s doing TikTok shop ads OMG\u201d was another top comment, along with \u201cThe universe has to be toying with us\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re DOOMED.\u201d"

    "summary": "The judge who presided over the California tax fraud case against Hunter Biden called out the president for mischaracterizing and minimizing the charges against his son in announcing why he was pardoning him.",
    "story": [
      "The judge who presided over the California tax fraud case against Hunter Biden called out the president for mischaracterizing and minimizing the charges against his son in announcing why he was pardoning him.",
      "\"The Constitution provides the President with broad authority to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, but nowhere does the Constitution give the President the authority to rewrite history,\" U.S. District Judge Mark C. Scarsi wrote in a ruling late Tuesday.",
      "An attorney for Hunter Biden had asked the judge to dismiss the indictment against his client in light of President Joe Biden's pardon on Sunday night, but did not initially submit a formal copy of the pardon, and instead sent a link to the president's statement saying that his son had been \"selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted\" and was the victim of a \"miscarriage of justice.\"",
      "Scarsi said the president\u2019s \u201crepresentations\u201d in the statement accompanying the pardon \u201cstand in tension with the case record.\u201d",
      "\"For example, the President asserts that Mr. Biden 'was treated differently' from others 'who were late paying their taxes because of serious addictions,' implying that Mr. Biden was among those individuals who untimely paid taxes due to addiction. But he is not,\" the judge wrote.",
      "He noted that Hunter Biden had said he \u201cwas severely addicted to alcohol and drugs\u201d through \"May 2019.\u201d",
      "\"Upon pleading guilty to the charges in this case, Mr. Biden admitted that he engaged in tax evasion after this period of addiction by wrongfully deducting as business expenses items he knew were personal expenses, including luxury clothing, escort services, and his daughter\u2019s law school tuition. And Mr. Biden admitted that he 'had sufficient funds available to him to pay some or all of his outstanding taxes when they were due,' but that he did not make payments toward his tax liabilities even 'well after he had regained his sobriety,' instead electing to 'spen[d] large sums to maintain his lifestyle' in 2020,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Biden had pleaded guilty to all of the allegations against him in the California case on the eve of trial in September. Prosecutors said he had \"engaged in a four-year scheme to not pay at least $1.4 million in self-assessed federal taxes he owed for tax years 2016 through 2019.\" He then \"filed false returns in February of 2020\" claiming bogus business deductions \"in order to evade assessment of taxes to reduce the substantial tax liabilities,\" which he still didn't pay, despite driving a Porsche and living in a $17,500-a-month rental house on a canal in Venice Beach, prosecutors said.",
      "The taxes were eventually paid after federal investigators told Biden they were looking into his finances in December 2020.",
      "Hunter Biden had been scheduled to be sentenced on the three felony and six misdemeanor tax charges later this month, before his father gave him a \"full and unconditional pardon\" for \"those offenses against the United States which he has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from January 1, 2014 through December 1, 2024.\"",
      "The pardon also covers a gun-related case in Delaware. Biden was convicted by a jury on those charges earlier this year and had been scheduled to be sentenced in that case this month. The cases were brought individually after a plea agreement that would have disposed of both without jail time fell apart when a judge questioned some of the particulars of the deal.",
      "Hunter Biden had argued in both cases that he was the victim of selective prosecution, but those claims were rejected by Scarsi and the judge in the Delaware case, Maryellen Noreika. Both are Trump nominees.",
      "\"According to the President, '[n]o reasonable person who looks at the facts of [Mr. Biden\u2019s] cases can reach any other conclusion than [Mr. Biden] was singled out only because he is [the President\u2019s] son.'\" Scarsi wrote. \"But two federal judges expressly rejected Mr. Biden\u2019s arguments that the Government prosecuted Mr. Biden because of his familial relation to the President. And the President\u2019s own Attorney General and Department of Justice personnel oversaw the investigation leading to the charges. In the President\u2019s estimation, this legion of federal civil servants, the undersigned included, are unreasonable people.\"",
      "David Weiss, the special counsel who brought the cases against Hunter Biden, made a similar\u00a0point in a court filing earlier this week, noting three appeals court panels had rejected the selective prosecution claims as well.",
      "There has \"never has been any evidence of vindictive or selective prosecution in this case,\u201d his office's filing said. \u201cIn total, eleven (11) different Article III judges appointed by six (6) different presidents, including his father, considered and rejected the defendant\u2019s claims, including his claims for selective and vindictive prosecution.\u201d",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the judge's remarks.",
      "Despite his issues with the president's statement, Scarsi vacated the sentencing hearing and indicated he would officially terminate the case after he gets an authenticating declaration confirming the pardon.",
      "Noreika ordered the Delaware case terminated on Tuesday."

    "title": "Supreme Court skeptical of challenge to Tennessee ban on transgender youth treatments",
    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 18:55:28 GMT",
    "summary": "The conservative-majority Supreme Court dives into the culture war issue of transgender rights as it weighs whether states can restrict gender transition care for minors.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The conservative-majority Supreme Court on Wednesday leaned toward upholding a Tennessee law that restricts gender transition treatments for minors in a significant case about transgender rights.",
      "It did not appear based on a lengthy oral argument that conservative justices believed the law constitutes a form of sex discrimination that would mean courts have to give it close scrutiny. The court\u2019s three liberal justices all appeared to view the law as classifying people by sex.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, is considering a challenge to the recently enacted law brought by the Biden administration and transgender teens and their families.",
      "The state measure, which was enacted last year, bars gender transition surgery for minors, as well as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. The surgery ban is not at issue in the Supreme Court case after a lower court judge said the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to challenge it.",
      "No matter how the court rules, it will have a broad impact, as more than 20 other states have passed laws similar to Tennessee\u2019s.",
      "Conservative justices questioned whether the court should second-guess the state Legislature on a medical issue over which there is considerable debate. The state argues that the law does not constitute sex discrimination, saying it is merely a form of medical regulation that applies equally to everyone.",
      "Several justices raised questions about changing views and increasing uncertainty among health authorities in Europe about some aspects of gender-affirming treatments.",
      "\"It strikes me as a pretty heavy yellow light, if not red light, for this court to come in, the nine of us, and to constitutionalize the whole area, when the rest of the world, or at least the people who the countries that have been at the forefront of this, are pumping the brakes on this kind of treatment,\" conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts expressed similar concerns, saying the justices are \"not the best situated to address issues like that\" in which conflicting views on medical issues have to be weighed.",
      "\"Doesn't that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than trying to determine them for ourselves?\" he asked.",
      "Conservative Justice Samuel Alito asked the toughest questions of the challengers, including Chase Strangio, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who became the first openly transgender person to argue at the court.",
      "Alito questioned the medical evidence for the efficacy of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, which the Biden administration has asserted is overwhelming. He also asked Strangio whether being transgender is an \"immutable characteristic\" in the same way as, for example, race.",
      "Alito was among those who pointed to recent moves by governments in Europe, including the United Kingdom's and Sweden's, to tighten standards for providing gender transition care for minors.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, representing the Biden administration, acknowledged there is \"a lot of debate\" about the proper model of treatment and for whom and at what age it would help, but she argued there was a consensus that the care can be medically necessary for some adolescents.",
      "She pointed out that the U.K. and Sweden have not outright banned such treatments.",
      "\"I think that's because of the recognition that this care can provide critical, sometimes lifesaving benefits for individuals with severe gender dysphoria,\" she said, referring to the clinical term given to the distress people can experience when their gender identities are in conflict with the genders assigned to them at birth.",
      "Among the liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor was most forceful in highlighting the impact of state bans on transgender youths.",
      "\"The evidence is very clear that there are some children who actually need this treatment,\" Sotomayor said. So courts have a duty to take a close look at the government's rationale for enacting laws \"to ensure that those children who are going to suffer all of these consequences will be made to do so only when it's compelling,\" she added.",
      "The oral argument Wednesday morning is the most significant so far of the court's latest term, which started in October and ends in June.",
      "There was a boisterous scene with supporters on both sides outside the court ahead of arguments. \"Every child deserves the chance to fly as their true self,\" a sign held by a pro-transgender rights attendee said. \"Stop transing kids,\u201d said another held by a woman supporting the state's law.",
      "The challengers argue that the Tennessee law is a form of sex discrimination, violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment, which requires equal treatment under the law. They say the law discriminates against transgender patients because there are other circumstances in which non-transgender patients can be treated with puberty blockers and hormone therapy for other reasons.",
      "Among other things, Prelogar argued that courts should consider laws targeting transgender people under a strict standard called \"heightened scrutiny.\" If the court were to adopt that approach, it would be easier for legal challenges against restrictions affecting transgender people to succeed. But it appeared unlikely based on the oral arguments that the court would take that route.",
      "Kavanaugh repeatedly questioned whether a ruling for the plaintiffs in the Tennessee case would dictate how challenges to other laws affecting transgender people, including those that restrict their access to girls' and women's sports teams, are resolved. He referred to \"competitive fairness and safety issues\" that some female athletes have raised.",
      "Wednesday's case is the most significant on transgender issues since a surprise 6-3 ruling in 2020\u00a0written by conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch. He concluded that federal law that bars sex discrimination in employment protected transgender and gay people, a ruling that angered conservatives.",
      "Gorsuch did not speak during Wednesday's argument, meaning his views on the case are unclear. Others mentioned the 2020 ruling, with conservatives indicating its rationale did not apply to the Tennessee dispute.",
      "In defending the Tennessee law, the state's attorney general, Jonathan Skrmetti, emphasized in court papers the rapid change in approach to how to treat minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "Major medical organizations say gender-affirming treatments are an effective way to treat gender dysphoria.",
      "But Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall, whose state has a ban similar to Tennessee's, is one conservative figure who has questioned those findings. He filed a brief describing what he called a \"medical, legal and political scandal\" led by activists to influence medical experts to help them win in court.",
      "In a related case that could indicate where the justices are leaning, the Supreme Court in April allowed Idaho to mostly enforce a similar law. The three liberal justices dissented.",
      "The case being argued Wednesday reached the Supreme Court after the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year rejected challenges to the Tennessee law and a similar measure in Kentucky. A district court judge had blocked the law, but the appeals court allowed it to go into effect.",
      "A potential wrinkle in the Tennessee case is that the incoming Trump administration could change the federal government's position in the case and come out in favor of the state's law before the court rules. Such a move might not, however, have any impact on how the case is decided. A ruling is expected by the end of June."

      "Since Nov. 5, the price of bitcoin has surged more than 45%. Year to date, prices have more than doubled.",
      "The six-figure mark is the latest lucrative milestone for a digital currency that emerged 15 years ago from a brief white paper written by a still-unknown author. The ideas that author, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, spelled out have since spawned an entire technological landscape dedicated to peer-to-peer transactions that now includes hundreds of other digital tokens as well as NFTs and trading platforms.",
      "But cryptocurrencies have remained controversial: Many of them, including bitcoin itself, have helped fuel a rise in cybercrimes and scams that the FBI says were responsible for billions of dollars in consumer losses last year.",
      "That's prompted current federal regulators to take a skeptical view of many cryptocurrency efforts.",
      "In the wake of the election, bitcoin advocates are hoping a new pro-crypto view will take hold in Washington that will put an end to strict regulation of and enforcement against digital tokens, while opening up bitcoin investing to traditional financial institutions and making it more profitable to mine bitcoin by increasing energy production.",
      "Trump, once a crypto-skeptic, has expressed interest in creating a U.S. bitcoin \"strategic reserve\" modeled on those for gold and oil. During his third presidential run, he appeared at this year's Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, to praise the crypto community for its innovation while vowing to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if elected.",
      "Bitcoin's price movements remain notoriously volatile, and that is unlikely to change no matter who is in office, experts say.",
      "Yet the upward price-growth over time is undeniable. More recently, a large share of demand fueling that growth has been funneled into exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track the price of bitcoin and are operated by major financial institutions, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF being the largest.",
      "In an interview, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, said that since launching in January, the IBIT ETF has grown to a value of more than $45 billion \u2014 and that just in the past month, it's seen its value increase by $4.1 billion.",
      "In addition to the electoral success of candidates friendlier to crypto, Jacobs said greater numbers of investors across the wealth spectrum \u2014\u00a0and throughout the world \u2014 are coming to view bitcoin as a hedge against geopolitical risks, especially currency devaluations sparked by inflation.",
      "With ETFs serving as an easy-to-use way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movements, it's only a matter of time before mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency reaches a tipping point, Jacobs said.",
      "\"There's growing interest across institutional or wealth-management space to learn, but it\u2019s always going to be a journey of education, and it takes time for that process for happen,\" he said."

      "Advanced hacking teams can be persistent and lurk in remote corners of vast computer networks. The U.S. does not believe any of the U.S. telecoms have fully booted the hackers, Neuberger said.",
      "\u201cThere is a risk of ongoing compromises to communications until U.S. companies address the cybersecurity gaps. The Chinese are likely to maintain their access,\u201d she said.",
      "China frequently denies responsibility when accused of using its vast cyberespionage teams to hack into Western targets. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for China\u2019s embassy in Washington said, \u201cChina firmly opposes the US\u2019s smear attacks against China without any factual basis.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor the first time in over a year, we have taken a modest price increase of approximately 2% nationally to offset inflation,\" Laurie Schalow, Chipotle's chief corporate affairs officer, said in a statement.",
      "The comment came, in part, as a response to an analyst report by Truist Securities financial group that observed the 2% increase at 20% of Chipotle locations surveyed.",

      "Vega's mother, Erika Pillsbury, says the development has inched her closer to a sense of closure, but she's still far from understanding the grim circumstances surrounding the killing \u2014 why her daughter was allegedly kidnapped, why she suffered such a horrific death and who else may have been involved.",
      "\"When I finally get all the pieces of this puzzle together, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be more mad, the same amount of mad or less mad,\" she said in an interview Wednesday.",
      "\"I'm sure there are moms out there that don't want to know,\" she added. \"I want to know.\"",
      "Since the arrest last month of Sencere Hayes, 22, on a charge of first-degree murder in connection with Vega's killing, authorities have offered no details about a possible motive, nor have they discussed Hayes' link to Arizona.",
      "Public records list Hayes' address as being in Chattanooga, Tennessee.",
      "An indictment shows that he was charged with first-degree murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and theft in connection with the April 17, 2023, killing of Vega, 22.",
      "At Hayes' initial appearance in a Maricopa County courtroom last week, a prosecutor said the murder investigation is ongoing and involves other people whom she did not identify.",
      "A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said he understood the many questions about the case that remain, but he declined to comment further because of the ongoing investigation. A spokesperson for the Maricopa County Prosecutor\u2019s Office also cited the case's status and declined to comment.",
      "In a statement last week, Sheriff Russ Skinner said that while \"there is still much work to be done, in collaboration with state, local and federal partners, we hope this arrest brings Mercedes\u2019 family one step closer to finding closure from this horrific crime.\"",
      "Hayes pleaded not guilty at his arraignment Wednesday. He is being held in lieu of a $2 million cash bond, jail records show. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Pillsbury said she and her husband sat directly behind Hayes in court \"because we wanted to make sure he knew we were there.\"",
      "\"We can't speak to him, but I can stare a hole in the back of his head,\" she said.",
      "Vega, who danced at a Phoenix strip club and had plans to open her own gym and become a personal trainer, was last seen in her apartment complex in Tempe, just east of Phoenix, shortly after 9 p.m. on April 16, 2023. A security camera captured her entering the building\u2019s garage.",
      "Authorities have not said what they believe happened next. Her family has said they found blood on the garage floor next to the spot where she parked her Dodge Charger, prompting them to believe she may have been assaulted and kidnapped.",
      "Hours later, before dawn on April 17, Vega\u2019s body was discovered in the back seat of a burned Chevy Malibu on Interstate 10 near Tonopah, west of Phoenix.",
      "She had been beaten, shot and burned, according to her autopsy, and her face appeared to have been doused in bleach, according to a forensic pathologist who reviewed the document for NBC News.",
      "It is not clear whom the Chevy Malibu belonged to. The vehicle had a salvage title, according to an incident report, and a spokesman for its most recent owner, State Farm Insurance, has declined to comment.",
      "The car was discovered after someone saw it in the interstate's westbound lane with flames in the back seat and dialed 911, according to the report.",
      "Authorities have said Vega\u2019s Charger was found parked in the middle of a street roughly a mile from the garage on April 18. The indictment alleges Hayes stole it.",
      "\"Was he following her?\" Pillsbury said of Hayes. \"Did he accidentally walk up on her?\"",
      "\"It's that unknown that can be really hard,\" she said. \"The truth will show us what really happened.\""

      "On Nov. 22 \u2014 the day the ship reached Yokosuka, Japan \u2014 Cuyler Condon, an electrician\u2019s mate, was found unresponsive in an on-base hotel, officials said. He was pronounced dead on the scene by medical staff members at U.S. Naval Hospital Yokosuka.",
      "Three days later, Dimitri Morales, 20, an electrician\u2019s mate fireman, was found unresponsive in town and declared dead by local emergency responders, the Navy said.",
      "The deaths were first reported by Stars and Stripes.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re just kind of sitting around, waiting for answers,\u201d said his older brother, Alexander Morales, 22. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy.\u201d",

      "The deaths sparked investigations, prompted visits from the Navy\u2019s most powerful officials and led to the relocation of more than 280 sailors.",
      "One of the investigations found that the shipyard lacked sufficient parking, transportation and access to food and housing.",

      "Opposition lawmakers say that if the motion fails to pass the first time, they will keep trying until Yoon is impeached. If the motion is passed, the Constitutional Court would then hold a trial to determine whether to confirm the impeachment, with a decision required within 180 days.",

      "The price of one bitcoin hit $100,000 for the first time Wednesday as demand for the digital currency continued to surge in the wake of an election that saw victories for crypto-friendly candidates led by President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Since Nov. 5, the price of bitcoin has surged more than 45%. Year to date, prices have more than doubled.",
      "The six-figure mark is the latest lucrative milestone for a digital currency that emerged 15 years ago from a brief white paper written by a still-unknown author. The ideas that author, known as Satoshi Nakamoto, spelled out have since spawned an entire technological landscape dedicated to peer-to-peer transactions that now includes hundreds of other digital tokens as well as NFTs and trading platforms.",
      "But cryptocurrencies have remained controversial: Many of them, including bitcoin itself, have helped fuel a rise in cybercrimes and scams that the FBI says were responsible for billions of dollars in consumer losses last year.",
      "That's prompted current federal regulators to take a skeptical view of many cryptocurrency efforts.",
      "In the wake of the election, bitcoin advocates are hoping a new pro-crypto view will take hold in Washington that will put an end to strict regulation of and enforcement against digital tokens, while opening up bitcoin investing to traditional financial institutions and making it more profitable to mine bitcoin by increasing energy production.",
      "Trump, once a crypto-skeptic, has expressed interest in creating a U.S. bitcoin \"strategic reserve\" modeled on those for gold and oil. During his third presidential run, he appeared at this year's Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, to praise the crypto community for its innovation while vowing to make the U.S. the crypto capital of the world if elected.",
      "Bitcoin's price movements remain notoriously volatile, and that is unlikely to change no matter who is in office, experts say.",
      "Yet the upward price-growth over time is undeniable. More recently, a large share of demand fueling that growth has been funneled into exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, that track the price of bitcoin and are operated by major financial institutions, with BlackRock's iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF being the largest.",
      "In an interview, Jay Jacobs, BlackRock's U.S. head of thematic and active ETFs, said that since launching in January, the IBIT ETF has grown to a value of more than $45 billion \u2014 and that just in the past month, it's seen its value increase by $4.1 billion.",
      "In addition to the electoral success of candidates friendlier to crypto, Jacobs said greater numbers of investors across the wealth spectrum \u2014\u00a0and throughout the world \u2014 are coming to view bitcoin as a hedge against geopolitical risks, especially currency devaluations sparked by inflation.",
      "With ETFs serving as an easy-to-use way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin's price movements, it's only a matter of time before mainstream interest in the cryptocurrency reaches a tipping point, Jacobs said.",
      "\"There's growing interest across institutional or wealth-management space to learn, but it\u2019s always going to be a journey of education, and it takes time for that process for happen,\" he said."

      "The stakes of the high court\u2019s decision in United States v. Skrmetti are high for the Welch family and many others who were gathered both inside and outside the court Wednesday.",
      "The central issue the justices are considering is whether Tennessee\u2019s law discriminates on the basis of sex. If the court says it does, the law would be subject to a stricter level of constitutional review that would be difficult to meet. If the court rules it doesn\u2019t, then Tennessee\u2019s law and similar restrictions in 25 other states would most likely stand. A decision against the sex-discrimination claim would also undermine a key argument against a similar policy proposal from President-elect Donald Trump to restrict transition-related care for minors and adults at the federal level.",
      "The questions the majority conservative court asked during oral arguments appeared to suggest that the justices didn\u2019t quite buy that the law discriminates based on sex, with some of them appearing to favor the state\u2019s argument that it restricts care based on its medical purpose.",
      "Many of those who showed up outside the court Wednesday said they wanted to show their support for the trans teens and a doctor who sued Tennessee.",
      "Kaleb Todd, 27, said that he has a personal connection to the decision both because he is a trans man and because he and his wife chose to move from Texas to Philadelphia in April because they want to start a family soon and they fear Texas\u2019 policies regarding women, educators and trans people.",
      "Todd, an engineer, said he also showed up outside the court in the chilly temperatures to send a message to the court itself.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remind people who get to make these decisions that we\u2019re here and we\u2019re beautiful and we know what\u2019s best for ourselves,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Vienna Cavazos, who is 18 and uses they/them pronouns, traveled from Delaware because, they said, the \u201cmonumental case is extremely important, not only to me and my family,\u201d but also in their work crafting pro-LGBTQ policy in Delaware.",
      "Like Todd, Cavazos is from Texas. Their family moved in 2022 following an executive order from Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in February that called on citizens to report parents to the state\u2019s Child Protective Services agency if they provided transition-related care to their minor children.",
      "Cavazos said that they planned to begin receiving such care but that \u201cit was either we wait until I turn 18 or leave Texas. We were fortunate enough to have the resources available to leave.\u201d",
      "Cavazos said the high court will have blood on its hands if it allows Tennessee\u2019s law to stand. If it doesn\u2019t, \u201cwe\u2019re still fighting.\u201d",
      "\u201cTrans people are not going anywhere,\u201d they said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to seek the health care whether it\u2019s legal or not.\u201d",
      "Devon Yates, who traveled from New York City and camped outside the court starting at 11 a.m. Tuesday to get a seat inside, described the oral arguments as \u201chorrible.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going to roll back the clock, that\u2019s what it looks like,\u201d he said.",
      "Yates said he wanted to attend oral arguments \u201cbecause I support the trans community.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is f------ hate,\u201d he said of Tennessee\u2019s law.",
      "A smaller group of counterprotesters organized by Do No Harm, a conservative medical policy group, also gathered outside the court Wednesday with signs that featured sayings including \u201cSex change is fantasy,\u201d \u201cPuberty blockers = Anti-Gay\u201d and \u201ckids don\u2019t need gender clinics.\u201d",
      "Matt Sharp, an attorney with the Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal group, said he was encouraged to hear what the Supreme Court had to say \u201cin this developing area of science.\u201d Multiple justices mentioned some European countries\u2019 restricting access to transition-related care for minors, though none have completely banned it.",
      "\u201cWhen Europe and other countries are reversing course, the United States, rather than challenging Tennessee, ought to respect the authority of Tennessee lawmakers as they looked at the science and decided there\u2019s a better course of action for Tennessee\u2019s kids,\u201d Sharp said. \u201cRather than putting them on a medicalized path, we can get them counseling and psychotherapy. We can let them have a natural childhood, let them naturally develop and put science above ideology and put truth above lies.\u201d",
      "Some of the rally attendees waved flags and held signs defiantly next to or in front of supporters of Tennessee\u2019s law.",
      "Nadine Seiler, 59, a T-shirt designer and self-described \u201crabble rouser\u201d from Waldorf, Maryland, waved a large trans flag with \u201cBlack trans lives matter\u201d written on it. She said the flag came from the Black Lives Matter Memorial fence that was erected along a section of the chain link fence outside the White House in 2020.",
      "She said she traveled to the court to show solidarity with marginalized groups, including the trans community, \u201cwho are going to be affected by Project 2025,\u201d a conservative policy road map that Democrats linked to the Trump campaign, which repeatedly distanced itself from the project.",
      "\u201cThis is just the beginning, and I am very concerned for everybody in marginalized groups,\u201d she said."

      "In a recent episode of the \u201cHow to Fail With Elizabeth Day\u201d podcast, the actor and director of the film said there were moments when he \u201cwould just have to leave\u201d the set.",
      "Baldoni not only brought Colleen Hoover's megahit book to life as director, but he also portrayed the troubled and abusive Ryle, who marries Blake Lively's character, Lily. The actor told host Elizabeth Day that it took him time to process and leave behind his complicated character after filming ended.",
      "\u201cDirecting is a very lonely job, I\u2019ll just be very candid. Because you are kind of at the top of this totem pole. In your moments of quiet, everybody has a thousand questions for you and also nobody wants to disturb you,\u201d Baldoni said. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t really have many people to talk to, and you can\u2019t necessarily share your anxiety or your nervousness about something because you\u2019re also the leader.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat was very hard and that took a few months,\u201d he said of releasing those feelings. \u201cI had dreams as him for a while, and it lived in my body, but I think for the most part, he\u2019s out.\u201d",
      "The release of \"It Ends With Us,\" which will arrive on Netflix Dec. 9, was met with criticisms and controversy surrounding what some called the romanticizing of domestic abuse. Some domestic violence survivors told TODAY.com that their criticisms include the lack of a trigger warning and resources as well as promotional content that seemed to depict the film as lighthearted. (Sony Pictures Entertainment, the film\u2019s distributor, declined to comment on the criticism at the time.)",
      "In the podcast interview, Baldoni briefly touched on how he wanted to approach the film with caution when it came to the subject matter.",
      "\u201cI just didn\u2019t want to re-traumatize the majority of my audience, which is why I was advocating for a trigger warning at the front and things like that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut those are certain battles that you can\u2019t always win.\u201d",

That's her armor, the same way that Elphaba uses black as her armor. There's nothing accidental about what their styling is. I wanted for each of them to feel and and appear as beautiful as possible, even in how they represent themselves.\"",
      "Tazewell says Erivo and Grande played a role in creating their costumes. For example, Erivo tried on multiple versions of Elphaba's hat before settling on the one she liked best.",
      "\"We had in-depth discussions early on what their emotional arc would be as it was reflected through the clothing,\" he says.",

      "\"Elphaba is caught emotionally at that time. We have her carry that through. It defines why she then gravitates toward black as her defining color,\" Tazewell says.",
      "For the stage production, costume designer Susan Hilferty embedded color into Elphaba's black dresses, a look she told Playbill in 2018 was inspired by \"looking at the stones in earth and gems.\"",
      "Tazewell had a different Easter egg for his Elphaba, leaning more toward texture than color.",

      "\u201cFrom my understanding, it was all Steinbrenner,\u201d Elway replies.",
      "The video then jumps back to 1981 with a Yankees executive making the pitch to draft Gwynn. Steinbrenner is miffed, though, at the idea of drafting Gwynn, who, in addition to playing baseball, was a basketball player at San Diego State University.",
      "Steinbrenner makes it clear he\u2019s eyeing Elway, who played baseball and football at Stanford University.",

      "\u201cNo more time to chat. It\u2019s calzone time,\u201d he says as he sends his employees out of his office. The calzone is a reference to a Season Seven episode of \"Seinfeld\" in which George Costanza gets Steinbrenner hooked on calzones.",
      "The video then goes back to present day and Elway waking up from a nap on his couch as his alarm goes off.",
      "Elway was indeed selected by the Yankees six spots ahead of Gwynn in the second round of that year\u2019s Major League Baseball draft and even wound up playing in some minor league games for the franchise before ultimately settling on playing in the NFL, where he would win a pair of Super Bowls. The set of cards features one of Elway on the Yankees, even though he never played a game for them.",
      "Meanwhile, things also worked out pretty well for Gwynn, who would become one of the best hitters in baseball history while playing all 20 years during his career for the Padres. He was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007 before dying in 2014 at the age of 54."

      "\u201cFor anyone who really understands the lifestyle of cowboys and working with animals and the risks of the job \u2014 and Rip says it about himself \u2014 it\u2019s a dangerous job, and this kind of thing happens and it happens in a split-second,\u201d she said. \u201cThis death comes as a shock because it\u2019s so simple, and it\u2019s so grounded in the world in which all these characters work that it\u2019s profoundly tragic \u2026 and the timing of it is just gut-wrenching.\u201d",
      "In an interview with Entertainment Weekly published the day after the episode aired, Richards shared his own take on his character's death, saying the season is \"really emphasizing the realities of cowboy life.\"",
      "\"We have this saying that everyone\u2019s going to fall off a horse at some point in their life. It\u2019s not if, it\u2019s just when and how bad. That is not a phenomenon. These things do happen, so I do think that there\u2019s that element where I think it is about really wanting to emphasize that this is a reality,\" he said.",
      "He called Colby's death \"poetic\" because in Season 3, Colby is trampled by a multiple horses. \"Maybe this was those horses\u2019 ancestors coming back to get retribution,\" he said.",
      "Who else has died on this season of \u2018Yellowstone\u2019?",
      "Colby\u2019s death comes on the heels of the exits of patriarch John Dutton (Kevin Costner) and fixer-turned-Jamie\u2019s-girlfriend Sarah Atwood (Dawn Olivieri).",
      "Dutton\u2019s farewell wasn\u2019t so much of a surprise, as Costner had already stated he wouldn\u2019t be returning to the show via Instagram reel in June. (He said in a Nov. 11 interview with Michael Smerconish for SiriusXM that he didn\u2019t quit the show.)",
      "Atwood\u2019s death was preordained before Costner\u2019s exit, according to The Hollywood Reporter, but \u201cwe had to wrap this all up at lightning speed\u201d once Costner exited, Olivieri told the publication.",
      "All of these losses, from co-workers to family alike, are bound to have huge repercussions for the season\u2019s (and likely series\u2019) final episodes. Are we done with the bloodbath yet? Knowing \u201cYellowstone,\u201d don\u2019t count anyone safe until the very end."

      "I knew I was going to be hanging out at Sound City Studios all the time. So I think acting in that, and putting myself in her shoes, and she's so brave and strong, you take on the character sometimes. I think it helped me get over a lot of my own insecurities, and made me kind of feel like I could go and make my record.",

    "published": "Sun, 01 Dec 2024 19:01:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Marissa Bode slammed negative comments made about her \"Wicked\" character Nessarose's disability on social emdia.",
    "story": [
      "Marissa Bode is addressing the derogatory comments made about her \u201cWicked\u201d character.",
      "Bode, who portrays the character Nessarose, the younger sister of Cynthia Erivo\u2019s Elphaba, posted a five-minute long video to her TikTok slamming the slew of negative comments she\u2019s received since the film premiered on Nov. 22.",
      "Despite enjoying seeing the outpouring of the love for the movie, Bode said there were reactions that made her feel \u201ca bit uncomfortable.\u201d",
      "In the video, Bode, who uses a wheelchair in real life and on screen, acknowledged that she is biased when it comes to her feelings about her own character. She said it was \"totally fine\" to make jokes about Nessarose\u2019s actions or personality because she is a fictional character.",
      "But, Bode explained, she was not okay with \u201caggressive comments and jokes about Nessa\u2019s disability,\u201d calling the messages \u201cdeeply uncomfortable because disability is not fictional.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, me, Marissa, is the person that is still disabled and in a wheelchair,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so it is simply a low hanging fruit that too many of you are comfortable taking.\u201d",
      "She continued, noting that in addition to her character, she's heard ableist jokes about herself. \u201cBefore even being cast in \u2018Wicked,\u2019 I had received comments just as me, Marissa,\u00a0not Nessa, around the words of \u2018Stand up for yourself,\u2019 \u2018I guess you can\u2019t stand him,\u2019 etc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen these jokes are being made by non-disabled strangers with a punchline of not being able to walk, it very much feels like laughing at, rather than laughing with,\u201d she added.",
      "Bode said the most frustrating part about acknowledging such comments was how scared she was to voice her opinion.",
      "\u201cThese comments do not exist in a vacuum,\u201d she said. \u201cAggressive comments of wanting to cause harm and push Nessa out of her wheelchair, or that she deserves her disability are two very gross and harmful comments that real disabled people, including myself, have heard before.\u201d",
      "The actor noted that she has seen the repercussions that her peers have experienced when they have called out ableism.",
      "\u201cThese disabled creators\u2019 comments are flooded with ableist comments,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen speaking on ableism, they\u2019re told to just take a joke and that they\u2019re asking for too much, and to stop complaining, to the point where some of my disabled peers have needed to take a break online for their own mental well being.\u201d",
      "Bode then implored those listening not to dismiss the feelings of others, but rather \u201clisten to the people or to the person that it is affecting and how it makes them feel.\u201d",
      "\u201cThankfully, I\u2019m at a place in my life today where I can recognize these jokes about disability are made out of ignorance,\u201d she said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say the same about Marissa 10 years ago, and it would have affected younger me a lot more, and I\u2019m worried that a younger version of myself is somewhere on the internet and is harmed by these comments.\u201d",
      "She concluded her message with a lesson she learned from \u201cWicked,\u201d adding, \u201cLastly, I want to say one of the major themes within \u2018Wicked\u2019 is having the ability to listen and to understand one another, and I truly hope that is something a lot of you can practice more and take with you.\u201d",
      "Bode made her feature film debut in the John M. Chu directed movie. The actor, who hails from Wisconsin, performed in plays in middle school and high school before she attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles in order to study acting.",
      "Before landing the role of Nessarose, she worked as an after-school art teacher and mentor, telling TODAY.com that she felt \u201cbeyond privileged and lucky\u201d to be cast in \u201cWicked\u201d one year after she graduated from college. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com\u2019s parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re not represented a lot and you don\u2019t see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, \u2018I know what I\u2019m capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cBut how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\u201d",
      "Bode is the first-ever physically disabled actor to take on the role of Nessarose, sharing that she was \u201cover the moon\u201d about the casting decision.",
      "She explained, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again.\u201d"

      "It was disagreements over how to rein in the French government\u2019s soaring budget deficit that did Barnier in.",
      "After France spent billions during the pandemic, Barnier moved to cut 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raise taxes by 20 billion euros.",
      "That wound up uniting two opposition blocs \u2014 typically at odds with each other \u2014 against Barnier.",

The victory helped Assad to secure his hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery.",

    "summary": "Syria's civil war has exploded back into life after Islamist rebels launched a lightning offensive on the northern city of Aleppo.",
    "story": [
      "In the messy patchwork of conflicts raging across the Middle East, one country has been absent from the spotlight: Syria.",
      "A civil war that dominated international headlines for more than a decade has now been reignited after a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a lightning offensive last week, seizing Aleppo, the country\u2019s second-largest city, from President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime.",
      "The rebels took only hours to recapture territory that Assad\u2019s forces had spent years reclaiming. Fighter jets from Syria and its ally Russia soon began bombing the area \u2014 killing hundreds of the rebels but civilians, too, according to a leading monitoring group.",
      "\u201cThis is a very unstable situation with a huge amount of flux,\u201d said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "Some anti-Assad activists hope it could herald the crumbling of a depleted regime; others fear the brutality of the Russia-Syrian response \u2014 as well as the hard-line ideology of the Islamist rebels themselves.",
      "It\u2019s also unclear how this may affect the 900 or so American troops still in the region, or the remnants of the Islamic State terror group that they are there to fight and that the Pentagon has warned may be regrouping.",
      "Here\u2019s what we do know:",
      "What happened?",
      "With little warning last Wednesday, a coalition of Syrian rebels launched a rapid assault that soon seized Aleppo as well as towns in the nearby Idlib and Hama provinces, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a U.K.-based monitoring group.",
      "The rebels are being led by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which grew out of a former al Qaeda affiliate called Jabhat al-Nusra and is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., the United Nations and others.\u00a0The State Department has a $10 million bounty for information about its leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "However, some analysts say the group has \u201cgreatly moderated\u201d its positions, as Robin Yassin-Kassab, author of \u201cBurning Country: Syrians in Revolution and War,\u201d wrote this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still an authoritarian Islamist militia\u201d but \u201chas a much more positive policy towards sectarian and ethnic minorities than ISIS,\u201d he said.",
      "For these anti-Assad observers, the group presents an opportunity to topple the brutality of his regime and its Russian and Iranian benefactors.",
      "But after the rebels\u2019 offensive, Syrian and Russian fighter jets responded by launching airstrikes on the rebel-held areas, with Assad\u2019s government claiming to have killed more than 400 of the \u201cterrorists.\u201d",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights puts the number of rebels killed in five days of fighting at 244, with 61 civilians killed alongside 141 government troops.",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi offered his full support to Assad and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would do likewise. And on Monday, Iran-backed militias based in Iraq crossed the border into Syria to support the government there, according to the Observatory.",
      "Why is this happening now?",
      "Syria\u2019s time on the back burner of international attention is also one  reason it has roared back into prominence, some experts say.",
      "Assad once looked like he might be toppled by the diverse group of rebels that rose up against him after the Arab Spring of 2011. That he has survived was largely because of the intervention of Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s Lebanon-based proxy.",
      "Russia\u2019s indiscriminate bombing, in particular, turned the tide against the rebels. It also transformed then rebel-held cities such as Aleppo and Homs into moonscapes of rubble and rebar. In all, the U.N. has documented more than 350,000 deaths but says this is \u201ccertainly an undercount.\u201d",
      "Today, however, Russia, Iran and Lebanon are distracted and depleted.",
      "Russia\u2019s primary focus is on the war in Ukraine, where it is locked in an attritional battle of trenches, tanks and mud with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Washington-backed government in Kyiv. In recent years Moscow has withdrawn assets from Syria, potentially weakening Assad\u2019s grip on power, experts say.",
      "Likewise, Iran has taken a hit at the hands of Israel, which has gutted Hezbollah\u2019s leadership and targeted its missile arsenal, while also fighting Hamas in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIranians have also shown that their forces are stretched and perhaps not as powerful as people get them credit for,\u201d said Hellyer, the Russia analyst who was speaking from Cairo. All of this \u201cputs Assad in a much weaker position.\u201d",
      "But \u201cthe Syrian regime, in coordination with the Russians and less so the Iranians, will hit them with everything they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added.",
      "Washington and ISIS",
      "Less clear is what role, if any, the U.S. may play.",
      "As well as the American troops based in Syria, there are another 2,500 in neighboring Iraq that are part of a residual 80-country coalition to prevent ISIS from regrouping.",
      "However, it\u2019s far from certain these forces will remain there after President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. He twice threatened to withdraw these troops during his first term.",
      "But the ISIS threat has not gone away, despite the group being purged in 2017 from the vast swaths of Syria and Iraq over which it had governed.",
      "In July, the Pentagon warned ISIS attacks were on track to double year-on-year.",
      "If HTS were to seize the city of Deir el-Zour \u2014 a former ISIS stronghold \u2014 then ISIS could be freer to expand its influence across the east of the country, some analysts believe.",
      "\u201cAs Assad\u2019s regime moves resources to the northwest\u201d to try to fight off the rebels, \u201cISIS will reap the rewards, filling vacuums\u201d elsewhere,  Charles Lister, director of the Syria program at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank, said in a post on X.",
      "If Assad were to fall altogether, Iran may no longer be able to use Syria as a pipeline of weapons and other supplies to Hezbollah, the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank, said in a briefing.",
      "However, any hopes for Assad's ouster should be tempered by who or what might replace him.",
      "\u201cMuch as I oppose the Assad regime, its atrocities and abuses, what is happening in Aleppo right now is terrifying. Many will die,\u201d Chris Doyle, director of the Council for Arab-British Understanding, posted on X. \u201cIf there was a chance of a lovely peaceful outcome to the benefit of Syrians, I will be thrilled. This is unlikely.\u201d"

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s party vowed Thursday to oppose efforts to impeach him over his failed attempt to impose martial law in the East Asian democracy, as opposition lawmakers said they would vote on the motion Saturday.",

      "Choi Byung-hyuk, a retired four-star army general who is currently the South Korean ambassador to Saudi Arabia, was named as Kim\u2019s successor.",
      "\u201cHe is a trusted member of the military and a man of principle,\u201d Chung Jin-seok, Yoon\u2019s chief of staff, told reporters.",

      "\u201cAll actions carried out by all military soldiers regarding the Emergency Martial Law were following my orders and directives, and so I bear the full responsibility for them,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "He did not directly address whether the emergency martial law was his idea, as opposition lawmakers and South Korean media have alleged.",
      "The National Office of Investigation said Thursday that it had ordered an overseas travel ban for Kim, who might face insurrection charges, after opposition lawmakers suggested he might try to flee the country.",
      "Yoon\u2019s office said Wednesday that his chief of staff and all senior presidential secretaries had also tendered their resignations. But it defended his declaration of martial law, South Korea\u2019s first since 1980, as necessary in the face of an impasse with opposition lawmakers that Yoon said had paralyzed the government.",
      "Under the martial law declaration, all political activity was banned and media was censored, drawing instant opposition from a public that lived for decades under military-authoritarian rule before South Korea transitioned into a vibrant democracy and the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy.",
      "Yoon, 63, rescinded the order after lawmakers defied a security cordon to enter the National Assembly in Seoul, the South Korean capital, where they voted unanimously to reject it. Protesters also arrived at the legislature, where some scuffled with security forces.",
      "He has not made any public appearances since announcing the order in a surprise late-night TV address on Tuesday.",
      "Lifting the order did little to dispel public shock and anger. On Wednesday night, protesters in downtown Seoul held a candlelight vigil and marched against Yoon, calling on him to resign.",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party said Thursday local time that lawmakers would vote on the Yoon impeachment motion on Saturday around 7 p.m. (5 a.m. ET). It was unclear whether lawmakers from Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, or PPP, would vote against the motion or simply not show up for the vote.",
      "A total of 191 lawmakers representing six opposition parties, plus one independent lawmaker, submitted articles of impeachment against Yoon on Wednesday. It takes a two-thirds majority vote in the unicameral National Assembly for the motion to pass.",
      "Though PPP leaders repudiated Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration and have asked him to leave the party, they said the party opposed the impeachment motion. The opposition bloc holds 192 seats, just under two-thirds of the 300-member legislature, meaning the motion could fail unless several PPP lawmakers break with their party and support it.",
      "Opposition lawmakers say that if the motion fails to pass the first time, they will keep trying until Yoon is impeached. If the motion is passed, the Constitutional Court would then hold a trial to determine whether to confirm the impeachment, with a decision required within 180 days.",
      "Though Yoon would remain at the presidential residence, his powers would be temporarily handed to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo until the court delivered its ruling.",
      "U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said Wednesday that Yoon had \u201cbadly misjudged\u201d his decision to declare martial law and that seemingly everyone was \u201cdeeply surprised\u201d by the move.",

      "\u201cWe are certainly not routinely informed of every decision that any partner may be making anywhere around the world at any given time,\u201d he said Wednesday in an interview with Reuters.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s important now is to see this process play out peacefully and according to the constitution and the rule of law,\u201d he added.",

The office also advised people to avoid mass gatherings and observe basic rules of hygiene, including washing hands with soap and water.",
      "Emergency public health officials have been dispatched to the region, according to the ministry.",
      "The World Health Organization told NBC News that it is aware of reports of an unidentified disease and is working with local authorities.",

      "Anne Rimoin, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has worked in Congo since 2002, said diagnosing the illnesses may be complicated by limited health care infrastructure and because of underlying health issues in some of the population, including malaria and malnutrition.",

      "Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease physician at Stanford Medicine, said the outbreak \u201cdoes raise alarm bells\u201d because of its location. Interactions between humans and wildlife in Congo increase the risk of a pathogen spilling over from animals, he said, and \u201cmany animal infections that transmit from animal to human can cause pretty severe disease.\u201d",
      "To identify the disease, Karan said, local health officials will start by screening for common illnesses like flu or malaria, before testing for less common pathogens. If all those tests are negative, officials may genetically sequence tissue, blood, mucus or bone marrow from infected people, he said.",
      "At the same time, international teams on the ground will collect information about what risk factors sick people have had in common and who they\u2019ve been in contact with, said Amira Albert Roess, a professor of global health and epidemiology at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cI think pretty quickly we\u2019ll start to have an answer as to what this is,\u201d Roess said, noting that there have been \u201ca lot of deaths, especially in such a short amount of time, with the same types of symptoms.\u201d"

      "Turetta, who admitted to killing Cecchettin but denied it was premeditated, was also found guilty of illegal possession of weapons, kidnapping and concealment of a corpse. He was also ordered to pay damages to Cecchettin\u2019s family and cover their legal fees.",
      "Cecchettin\u2019s murder was one of more than 100 cases of femicide in Italy last year, primarily at the hands of family members or romantic partners.",
      "The student\u2019s death gripped the nation after details emerged about Turetta\u2019s possessive nature and Cecchettin\u2019s attempts to end the relationship. More than 10,000 people attended her funeral last December.",
      "To raise awareness of domestic violence, Cecchettin\u2019s family released a list written by her a few months before her death titled \u201c15 reasons I had to break up with him.\u201d",
      "In it, she cited requirements for her to help him study and noted that he would complain if she didn't send him enough emojis. In an 80-page statement written from jail in childlike handwriting, Turetta also acknowledged that he could not accept any outcome other than getting back with her.",
      "However, it was emotional comments from Cecchettin\u2019s sister, Elena Cecchettin, that prompted a political furor and reignited public debate over patriarchy and gender roles in Italian society.",
      "In an article in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra, Elena wrote that Turetta was not \u201ca monster\u201d but rather the \u201chealthy son of a patriarchal society.\u201d",
      "\u201cA monster is an exception, a person external to society, a person for whom society should not take responsibility.\u00a0And instead the responsibility exists,\u201d she wrote in November 2023, according to a Google translation.",
      "The far-right government was lambasted by Cecchettin\u2019s family and opposition parties after Minister of Education Giuseppe Valditara argued last month that the patriarchy no longer exists in Italy and that the rise in sexual violence was instead linked to illegal immigration.",
      "He was speaking at the\u00a0launch of a foundation established by Cecchettin's father in memory of his daughter.",
      "The Italian government did not immediately respond to NBC\u2019s request for comment on the remarks.",
      "In the wake of Cecchettin\u2019s death, the Italian Senate last year approved new measures aimed at addressing violence against women, including stricter restraining orders and heightened surveillance of men found guilty of gender-based violence.",
      "Still, nongovernment organizations and opposition politicians believe the measures do not go far enough and are demanding that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni take further steps to combat gender inequality and reduce crime against women in the country."

      "Hama, Syria\u2019s fourth-largest city, might represent an even more significant fillip than the sudden capture last week of Aleppo \u2014 the country\u2019s most populous city \u2014 in the civil war's most significant offensive in years and one that could dramatically shift the balance of the country's conflict.",
      "Even though the map of Syria has been repeatedly redrawn since 2011, Hama has never been in rebel hands. Insurgents and Turkey-backed fighters opposed to the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad were under 10 miles from the city, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Lt. Col. Hassan Abdul-Ghani, a senior rebel commander, denied government claims that his fighters near the city had been repelled."

    "published": "Wed, 04 Dec 2024 11:26:58 GMT",
    "summary": "France's far-right leader Marine Le Pen says she will seek to topple Macron's prime minister, Barnier, in the French parliament.",
    "story": [
      "Just as Paris\u2019 Notre-Dame cathedral rises from the ashes, France\u2019s government is teetering on the brink of collapse.",
      "President Emmanuel Macron put on a brave face last week while touring the rebuilt Paris landmark gutted by fire in 2019, as his administration hailed the reconstruction as a symbol of national unity and French can-do.",
      "But his fragile parliamentary coalition could be toppled by an unlikely combination of far-right and leftist opponents Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe country is at a turning point,\u201d Finance Minister Antoine Armand told French television Tuesday, urging its politicians \u201cnot to plunge the country into uncertainty.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s the latest chapter in the political instability roiling France and Europe as a whole, where far-right populists and nationalists \u2014 many of them allies of American President-elect Donald Trump \u2014 are capitalizing on public discontent about rising prices and immigration, and challenging mainstream political parties.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know:",
      "Why the French furor?",
      "Macron\u2019s center-right prime minister, Michel Barnier, is facing a no-confidence vote filed by far-right leader Marine Le Pen and her National Rally party. The left-wing New Popular Front coalition has also filed a similar motion, teeing up a debate and vote in the National Assembly starting 4 p.m. local time (10 a.m. ET).",
      "Barnier, who was appointed by Macron in September, told French TV Tuesday that it was \u201cpossible\u201d he could survive. But the math does not look good for him.",
      "Only 289 votes from the 577 lawmakers will be needed to secure his ouster and the far-right and leftist factions number more than 320.",
      "If the government falls, it would be the shortest lived in France\u2019s history.",
      "\u201cFrance is currently looking ungovernable,\u201d said Rainbow Murray, a professor specializing in French politics at Queen Mary University of London. \u201cEven if this government falls and is replaced by another, there\u2019s no guarantee that a new one will fare any better.\u201d",
      "The main disagreement centers over Barnier\u2019s attempts to rein in France\u2019s soaring budget deficit. After France spent billions during the pandemic, Barnier wants to cut 40 billion euros ($42 billion) in spending and raise taxes by 20 billion euros.",
      "France\u2019s deficit is currently projected to hit 6.1% of GDP, far higher than  the European Union requirement of 3% or lower. The looming economic and political crises has spooked markets, with French borrowing costs briefly rising above those of Greece on Monday.",
      "Without\u00a0a majority in France\u2019s lower house, Barnier\u00a0has told lawmakers he plans to use Article 49.3 of the French Constitution \u2014 often referred to as a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d ultimatum.",
      "This means he can pass legislation without a vote, but his opponents can file votes of no confidence against him if they wish and this time they have.",
      "A divided legislature",
      "After Macron stunned Europe by calling snap parliamentary elections in June, Le Pen was only blocked from power by Macron\u2019s centrists and their left-wing opponents working together tactically.",
      "The upshot was a legislature divided between left, center and far-right \u2014 with none holding enough power to govern securely alone.",
      "\u201cThese are three political groups that can\u2019t work together and it\u2019s been impossible to find a consensus,\u201d said Murray.",
      "Macron shunned the leftists, who won the most seats without securing a majority, and instead tapped Barnier, who was able to cobble together enough conservatives and centrists to govern without an absolute majority.",
      "While the outraged left have regularly voted against him, Barnier has been able to work with the far-right by making policy concessions on issues such as crime and immigration. But Le Pen says the budget cuts and tax rises are \u201cred lines\u201d she will not cross.",
      "\u201cWe said what were the nonnegotiable elements for us,\u201d she said Monday. \u201cWe are straight in our political approach. We defend the French people.\u201d",
      "This creates a huge headache for Macron, who is responsible for appointing prime ministers to be approved by parliament. But he cannot dissolve the parliament again until 2025, meaning he has to work with what he\u2019s got.",
      "While he could try to bring Barnier back in, appoint a successor or an apolitical government of technocrats, all would be vulnerable to dethroning by the far-right.",
      "If Macron \u201ccannot get a government together with the support of a majority in parliament, he is going out and going to come under increasing pressure to resign,\u201d said Douglas Webber, an emeritus professor at the INSEAD business school, based in Paris.",
      "Rise of the far right",
      "France, Europe\u2019s second largest economy, is just one of several Old World powers whose establishment is creaking under pressure from the hard right.",
      "The continent\u2019s other powerhouse, Germany, is also in crisis. Its left-wing coalition collapsed in November and the far-right Alternative for Germany is polling in second place ahead of February elections.",
      "The far right have also made gains in the Netherlands, Austria, Finland and elsewhere. Many of them have welcomed Trump\u2019s election to a second term, setting up the prospect of a transatlantic alliance between these bedfellow forces that were recently regarded as a political fringe.",
      "\u201cThere is a hollow core at the heart of Europe because the Franco-German engine, which is supposed to keep the E.U. ticking over and on the rails, is now derailed,\u201d Webber said. \u201cThere is a kind of vacuum at the heart of Europe at a very unfavorable time.\u201d",
      "In France, the big prize will be won or lost in 2027, the date of the next presidential election.",
      "Macron cannot run again due to term limits, leaving Le Pen as the current bookmakers\u2019 favorite. One wrinkle for her could be her ongoing trial on accusations of embezzling European Union funds, in which prosecutors are requesting a five-year ban from public office. She denies the charges, calling them an \u201coutrage.\u201d",
      "That could \u201crule her out of the next presidential election,\u201d Murray from Queen Mary said. \u201cUnless it\u2019s brought forward.\u201d"

      "\u201cThese citizens committed an administrative offense, which was expressed in obvious disrespect for society, accompanied by obscene language in a public place,\u201d a Moscow court wrote in two statements announcing the guilty verdicts.",
      "The raids were executed exactly a year after Russia\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that LGBTQ activists and the LGBTQ \u201cmovement\u201d should be designated as extremists. Russians found guilty of extremism can be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison.",
      "Videos and images of the raids shared on social media over the weekend showed stunned clubgoers lying on dance floors with their hands above their heads as police officers sifted through the crowds and shouted orders.",
      "Baza, an anonymously run Telegram news channel that has over 1.5 million followers, reported that police blocked club exits and interrogated clubgoers at Arma before detaining dozens. Clubgoers who were not brought into custody were allowed to leave Arma roughly three hours after the raid began, according to Baza. (Arma, then known as Mutabor, was the site of the 2022 \u201calmost naked\u201d party, which drew fierce criticism after Russian celebrities, influencers and socialites attended clad in revealing clothing months after the invasion of Ukraine.)",
      "Monday was not the first time the Russian government has coordinated a clampdown on \u201cLGBT propaganda.\u201d Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling last year, gay bars in cities across Russia were similarly raided by police. Sporadic raids have reportedly persisted throughout the country since then.",
      "Critics viewed last year\u2019s Supreme Court ruling as part of a wider crackdown on LGBTQ rights in Russia under the leadership of President Vladimir Putin, who has been in power for roughly a quarter of a century. Notably, the Russian government passed legislation in 2013 known as the \u201cgay propaganda law,\u201d making it illegal \u201cto spread information about nontraditional sexual behavior\u201d to minors. The law was expanded to apply to adults, effectively banning public symbols or gestures of \u201cnontraditional sexual relations.\u201d Russians who violate the so-called propaganda law could face up to 400,000 rubles ($6,500) in fines.",
      "Last month, Putin signed additional legislation that bans nationals from countries that allow gender transitions to adopt Russian children."
